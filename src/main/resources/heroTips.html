Unlike other supports, Abaddon's Borrowed Time allows him to be in the middle of the fight, converting heavy attacks back into health. His Mist Coil Aphotic Shield makes it frustratingly hard for enemies to bring down his allies, and their low cooldowns can turn fights around at crucial moments. Curse of Avernus slows foes hit by your sword, giving them a hard time running from you and your allies (since you can hit them with no worries while your ultimate is off cooldown), at the same time increasing your allies attack speed and movement speed if they also hit the enemy. Although Abaddon's common build seldom allows him to do enough damage to kill enemies alone, he can still provide cheap nuke damage while played as support, and under favorable circumstances, he can also be played as a semi-carry.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very tanky support.<br/>Low cooldowns.<br/>Can fulfill multiple roles.<br/>Has a built-in dispel.<br/>Great support for beginners.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low mobility.<br/>Low starting armor.<br/>Long cast animations.<br/>Mana dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Abaddon is renowned for his multipurpose spells capable of manipulating how much damage the enemy is able to deal to his team, and turn it against them. In this way, Abaddon is not only able to protect and heal his teammates, but also possesses offensive potential capable of dealing damage to enemies as well.<br/>Abaddon's versatile skill set allows him to be played as either a carry or a support, depending on what his team needs. He is able to gear his skill build towards protecting teammates and shielding them from harm, or for more offensive purposes to give himself more damage output.<br/>Beware that Abaddon has very long cast animations for Mist Coil and Aphotic Shield, requiring roughly 50% more time to cast his spells than most other heroes. Positioning and planning ahead are crucial for allowing Abaddon to get his spells off in time.<br/>One of Abaddon's early weaknesses is his poor agility, resulting in low base armor (and thus vulnerability to physical damage despite being a strength hero) and poor attack speed (hampering his carry potential). Rectifying his armor weakness is crucial in order to make him effective in any role he plays, though improving his attack speed is dependent on if he is playing as a carry.<br/> Depending on if he is being built as a support or carry, Abaddon has differing itemization priorities and skill builds.
<br/>Abaddon is generally played as a safe lane support due to the vast survivability his skills provide for his team. His role in the safe lane is to control lane equilibrium through pulling creep waves, as his ability to harass the enemy off-laner is hampered by being a melee hero. He also stacks jungle camps for his carry to farm later, and acts as a babysitter capable of protecting his lane against enemy aggression with his powerful survivability spells. As a support he focuses on building mana items to allow him to continue casting his spells, and HP regen items to fuel the cost of Mist Coil, then utility items to give his team an advantage in fights. His skill build aims towards maxing out Aphotic Shield and Mist Coil first in order to maximize his early nuking power while also protecting his teammates.<br/>As a carry, Abaddon must gear towards tankiness and damage output, forcing the enemy to treat him as a threat so that he can take advantage of his ultimate. A carry Abaddon is geared less towards casting but more towards damage output, prioritizing Mist Coil for nuking power and Curse of Avernus for attack speed. Unlike most carries that try to directly attack and kill the enemy, Abaddon's carry potential lies in forcing the enemy to engage him and wasting their nukes and disables on him, and then negating that damage with his ultimate.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Alchemist is a formidable carry capable of amassing large amounts of gold, and sustaining himself almost indefinitely during teamfights. Armed with a Shadow Blade, Alchemist can also gank effectively by stunning enemies with Unstable Concoction. Because of the extra gold from his Greevil's Greed, Alchemist will always snowball into a potent fighter if a match goes long. Under Chemical Rage, a well-farmed Alchemist can demolish heroes and structures alike with alarmingly fast attack speed, all the while regenerating his health at incredible rates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Scales well into late game.<br/>Good comeback potential.<br/>Capable of farming gold quickly.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Highly reliant on his ultimate.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Worst stat growth in the game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Alchemist is a fairly heavy carry, but may still have trouble dealing with other hard carries, such as Spectre.<br/>Alchemist farms faster than any other hero, thank to his 3rd ability, Greevil's Greed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Axe is a very strong initiator and disabler as he possesses an area disable capable of piercing spell immunity in Berserker's Call, and a low-cooldown slow in Battle Hunger that also boosts his movement speed. Given mobility and mana sustain, Axe is capable of wreaking havoc against enemies at all points of the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Powerful ganker once he gets his Blink Dagger.<br/>Very good at punishing melee heroes in lane.<br/>Can farm lanes and the jungle very quickly.<br/>Almost completely unaffected by spell immunity.<br/>Very resistant to physical damage.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Damage output falls off in the late game.<br/>Can have a hard time against ranged heroes in lane.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Countered by Nukers and Disablers.<br/>If Axe sees a group of enemies, he should be very careful, as he needs to catch the entire group with his Berserker's Call, otherwise, the less enemies caught in Axe's trap, the more chances of dying he gets.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>The synergy between Berserker's Call and Counter Helix means that Axe is capable of dealing great amounts of pure damage during initiations, but must build for survivability to ensure he is not killed by enemy attacks during his initiations.<br/>Axe's spells give him powerful harassment potential and survivability, allowing him to punish enemy lanes and gain an early advantage for his team. In order to transition well into the late game he requires farm, however his initiation and disabling abilities allow him to set up ganks and early teamfights to get the gold he needs to remain relevant.<br/> As a melee initiator with strong survivability spells, Axe can be a very strong off-laner, or a powerful jungler.
<br/>A combination of Berserker's Call and Counter Helix make Axe a good off-laner, as he can deal large amounts of damage with Counter Helix if the enemy dares to attack him at melee range. As well, he has the ability to force the enemy to attack him via Berserker's Call if he can get close enough, also using his enemy's lane creeps against them to increase the proc chance of Counter Helix.<br/>Counter Helix allows Axe to be a strong jungler, as he can whittle down neutral camps without expending mana. Additionally, Axe's position in the jungle allows him to rotate mid to help set up ganks, or help to harass and gank the enemy's off-laner.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Beastmaster is a utility hero that brings many benefits to his team, such as clearing trees with Wild Axes. His scouting Hawk functions like a moving ward, and his Boar slows down enemies with ranged attacks. Inner Beast speeds up allied attacks, and Primal Roar is the best single-target stun in the game. That said, Beastmaster does not excel at any one particular role and is usually played as a semi-support or initiator. His summons require a modest amount of micromanagement, which can be intimidating to new players. Beastmaster can pick off supports with ease, but cannot go head-to-head against heavier heroes. Depending on the situation, players can build Beastmaster as an initiator, pusher, or an armor/strength based brawler.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Large scouting vision with Hawk.<br/>Long duration stun that goes through Spell Immunity.<br/>Good at Pushing.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low damage.<br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/>Requires some micromanagement.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Beastmaster is usually played solo in the offlane, but also sometimes in the mid lane.<br/>Some enemy setups can shut down Beastmaster in lane. If needed, ask a support to join you.<br/>Micromanaging Beastmaster's summons, especially his Hawk, is important to winning games.<br/>Compared to other supports, Beastmaster is fairly tanky.<br/>Beastmaster has no escape mechanisms. Engage carefully.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Brewmaster is an unpredictable brawler who sows disarray among enemy formations. With the help of a Blink Dagger, he jumps in to initiate with Thunder Clap, then divides into three elemental beings with Primal Split. He lands critical hits and dodges at random due to Drunken Brawler, dealing significant damage. Brewmaster is fairly tanky, and difficult to kill when he splits apart with his ultimate. However, he does not excel at any one purpose, and should be considered a hybrid between initiator, brawler, and tank.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High survivability with ultimate.<br/>Numerous disables when in ultimate form.<br/>Counters carries.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Requires fast micromanagement.<br/>No mobility skills.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Brewmaster is usually played solo in the off-lane, although he can also work as a mid hero.<br/>With his numerous disables during Primal Split, and the blind from Drunken Haze, Brewmaster is effective in shutting down physical damage carries.<br/>When playing Brewmaster, try to gain an advantage for your team early before anybody on the enemy team, particularly the carry, can build a Black King Bar, as his disables cannot penetrate spell immunity.<br/>If Brewmaster is being played more in the semi-carry role, consider using his ultimate as a life saver to keep yourself in the fight when you would normally die. The utility of the summoned spirits works excellently for finishing off opponents as well as initiation.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bristleback is a very good tank not only because of his formidable health pool, but also because of one of his abilities Bristleback, making him more of a tank when fighting his back. Being a carry and a tank at the same time, he can easily become team's initiator, capable of dealing and taking tons of health in a teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very durable.<br/>Effective ganker early and mid game.<br/>Can chase down fleeing enemy easily.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Has mana issues in early and mid game.<br/>Not effective against high-armor heroes.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Bristleback's mana woes can easily be remedied by a Sage's Mask or a Ring of Basilius, since his abilities have extremely low mana costs.<br/>One of Bristleback's main weaknesses is his lack of disables, meaning he cannot silence or interrupt an enemy from casting spells. You can either rely on your teammates for disables, or buy an item of your own, so long as it benefits him in some way (a good example would be a Scythe of Vyse, since it gives him good mana regeneration for his abilities, and a devastating hex disable).<br/>Beware Legion Commander and Axe, as both of them have abilities that force you to turn and face them for a few seconds, ensuring their and their teams damage is not directed to your back and thus making you far more vulnerable in a teamfight.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Centaur Warrunner is an aggressive tank who excels when he is placed in the middle of fights. He reflects damage with his passive ability Return, while stunning and attacking the area around him with Hoof Stomp and Double Edge. Unlike other tanks, Centaur Warrunner sacrifices some durability in exchange for damage output, and may have a hard time recovering if the early game does not go well.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Tanky early game to late game<br/>Can be useful to the team without large amounts of gold/items, but also benefits greatly from any gold he can get.<br/>Can gank very effectively.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Countered by lifesteal.<br/>Low mana.<br/>Low damage in the late game.<br/>Vulnerable to enemy abilities which remove a percentage of health or kill at a certain health threshold.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Centaur Warrunner is usually played solo in the off-lane. However, with a support who has hard disables (such as Earthshaker or Lion) he can absolutely dominate the safe-lane and potentially get several kills.<br/>Centaur Warrunner can also semi-jungle if the lane is going badly.<br/>Centaur's actual damage is average at best in the early game, with slow attack speed and only one damaging ability that hurts himself as well. However, Return can do crippling damage to the enemy team if they choose to heavily harass him.<br/>Centaur's late-game damage is entirely dependent upon how much Strength he has. If he ends up with over 200 strength (achieved by items such as Heart of Tarrasque and Armlet of Mordiggian) then he can deal frightening amounts of damage.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Chaos Knight is a powerful strength hero dealing High Physical DPS that smashes his foes with straight, but powerful hits due to his Chaos Strike. Chaos Bolt is a luck-base spell that makes it hard to use, and he can close the gap with his enemies through Reality Rift. Phantasm has long recharge time, it would be recommended to time your ultimate for teamfights only. Chaos Knight requires adequate farming and an aggressive mindset to trample enemy Heroes. Once enough farming, he can overpower the late game with lots of Physical DPS with his Illusions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Good movement speed.<br/>Great late game.<br/>Can be aggressive in early and mid game.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very RNG reliant.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Very tempting for enemy heroes.<br/>Highly reliant on his ultimate.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>In most situations, max Chaos Bolt and Reality Rift first, since the critical damage from your Chaos Strike is negligible in the early game.<br/>Always activate your Armlet of Mordiggian before using your ultimate, since the illusions also gain bonuses from it.<br/>Sange and Yasha is sub-optimal even for ganking CK, better of finishing  Heaven's Halber if you have the mana.<br/>If you manage to farm a Manta Style you gain two additional albeit somewhat weaker illusions that serve to wreck havoc among enemy ranks, Manta Style illusions much like Phantasm and rune illusions are pulled to your target with Reality Rift. You can often use this to block your target in a swarm of illusions they will not be able to escape from. The ultimate orb from Manta Style also boosts your mana pool just enough to allow you to cast illusions together with your ultimate ability.<br/>It is not entirely advisable to pick Chaos Knight against enemies that can easily clear illusions such as Medusa, Lion, Pugna owning to the fact that they can clear illusions regardless of their stats and given that your illusions are produced by your ultimate ability with a rather long cooldown you cannot afford to have them destroyed easily like Naga Siren, Terrorblade and Phantom Lancer who can produce illusions much more frequently.<br/>You may also want to be careful against an enemy that drains mana such as Quas Wex focused Invoker. Given Chaos Knight's dismal mana pool and intelligence gain Invoker's EMP can completely drain him of mana even in later stages of the game and without his active abilities Chaos Knight is not nearly as potent.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Clockwerk is a tanky initiator and ganker built to isolate and separate enemies. His array of disables and nukes provide strong crowd control in any situation, allowing him to greatly disrupt the enemy. Rocket Flare provides distant scouting vision, and Hookshot allows Clockwerk to initiate from extreme distances. He specializes in trapping and zoning out enemies with Power Cogs, allowing him and his team to pick off single heroes. With Blade Mail, his core item, Clockwerk reflects damage and forces enemies to risk their lives by attacking him, or entering deeper into his team formation to find different targets. His abilities require good positioning and aim, which can be daunting for newer players. Clockwerk's damage scales badly into the late game, where his purpose will be limited to initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Tanky, super long range initiator.<br/>Powerful area control.<br/>Effective ganker.<br/>Good scouting vision.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low damage in the late game.<br/>Requires good aim.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Clockwerk's main purpose is to force enemies to fight him one on one inside his Power Cogs, where Battery Assault and Blade Mail gives him an advantage.<br/>Clockwerk has very strong initiation abilities, but his damage scale off greatly the longer a game goes due to enemies' mana and HP pools getting larger. As such, he is most effective in the early- and mid-game where he can get ganks off and secure map control for his team to gain an early advantage.<br/>While he has good base strength and impressive strength growth, Clockwerk suffers from poor base agility, meaning that he is quite vulnerable to physical damage if he does not get any armor items.<br/>Clockwerk's caster-oriented skill set means that he needs a source of mana regeneration in order to be effective. Due to all this and his strong initiation spells, Clockwerk benefits most from building items that give him survivability, mobility and mana.<br/>Clockwerk can be effective in the early to mid-game even without many items.<br/>In most cases, Clockwerk is played as an off-laner, as his spells allow him to harass the enemy while also providing a measure of survivability. As well, he can be very powerful with early levels, becoming a strong roamer and ganker once he hits level 6.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Doom is a versatile carry who can become a powerful late-game threat due to his ability to quickly farm with Devour, his strong nuking power, and his ultimate Doom that lets him disable an enemy for at least 15 seconds. His skill set and fast farming potential allows him to be built in any number of ways to meet the enemy threat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Doom's ultimate is one of the strongest single target disables in the game.<br/>Devour boosts gold income and grants Doom access to jungle creep abilities.<br/>High base STR and high STR growth gives Doom naturally high HP and base damage.<br/>Potent scaling damage-over-time debuff from Infernal Blade.<br/>Versatile hero that can be built in a variety of different ways, as either a support or core.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Vulnerable to ranged heroes<br/>Very vulnerable to slows<br/>Low starting base armor<br/>Little to no armor increase through stats<br/>Has low intelligence<br/>Has low base agility and low agility gain<br/>Has a 2.0 BAT (the lowest in the game), with low agility (base and gain), making the use of his nuke very unreliable<br/>Nuke is considered a normal right-click, meaning it can miss if the opponent hero has evasion.<br/>Can't properly tank without his 2nd skill<br/>Any other proper tank can be a better aura carry, if they get equal or more farm than Doom<br/>Vulnerable to early harassment<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>One of Doom's greatest weaknesses is his minimal base armor and extremely low agility, making him very vulnerable to physical damage despite being a strength hero, and reducing his physical damage output potential. As well, he has the lowest base attack time in the game, meaning that his attack speed is extremely slow unless boosted by items. Therefore, he must build armor items in order to survive in teamfights, and attack speed items in order to be able to deal any damage to enemies.<br/> Due to his Devour ability, Doom is a good farmer who can quickly get the gold to purchase many strong core items to alleviate his weaknesses. His ability to obtain gold and experience using this ability also allows him to greatly diversify and play many different roles depending on what his team needs.
<br/>In general, Doom is best played as a safe lane carry, as his ability to farm can allow him to get numerous powerful items that give him strong teamfight presence. The degree to which he can carry is almost unlimited, and can be chosen depending on which stage of the game it is best to end on based on the enemy team's lineup.<br/>Doom's ability to instantly kill creeps with Devour makes him a respectable jungler, as he can farm neutral camps relatively quickly with the ability. He can also rotate with any abilities he has gained through consuming creeps to gank the enemy as needed.<br/>With a few points in Scorched Earth, Doom can be a very strong off-laner, as the spell can give him the mobility and survivability he needs to stay alive. Devour allows him to consume creeps, both enemy and neutral, to guarantee gold and experience gain, while Infernal Blade allows him to inflict surprising amounts of damage against enemy supports that attempt to trade hits with him.<br/>Doom can also play a utility or support role, as his ultimate gives him a way to contribute to a teamfight regardless of how much farm he has. Devour allows him to obtain gold without being given major farm priority, meaning that even if given the priority of a hard support he can get gold to buy items that help him or his team.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dragon Knight is a durable front-line carry who can transform into a dragon and wipe out enemies with ranged projectile attacks. His heavy armor and regeneration from Dragon Blood makes him tankier than most carries, especially in the early game. If his team gains the upper hand, Dragon Knight's presence often ensures continued domination with little chance of enemy comeback. With a Shadow Blade, Dragon Knight can make a decent ganker due to Dragon Tail and its long stun duration. While resilient, Dragon Knight's damage output depends heavily on his dragon form, and can be rather useless if caught while it's on cooldown. Dragon Knight is also quite slow, and has no mobility skills.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Heavy armor against physical attacks.<br/>High health regeneration.<br/>Instant cast animations.<br/>Strong splash damage.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Slow movement speed.<br/>Very dependent on his ultimate.<br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Dragon Knight is one of the few heroes with no cast time on his abilities, so abilities can be cast in between attacks on the backswing animation.<br/>Creep stacking is a good tactic for Dragon Knight, as his ultimate will clear camps quickly.<br/>Dragon Knight has a quick, clean attack animation, making last hitting fairly easy (especially with a Quelling Blade).<br/>With any source of lifesteal, Dragon Knight rarely needs to return to the fountain.<br/>In the early game, enemies teams may choose to ignore Dragon Knight during teamfights, due to his low damage.<br/>Dragon Knight's item build varies depending on what he's facing. Good players must analyze enemies' items to make an informed decision.<br/>Despite being tanky against physical damage, Dragon Knight has no defenses against magical and pure damage. Don't overestimate his tankiness against a mixed lineup of heroes.<br/>Like several other carries, Dragon Knight relies heavily on Black King Bar to keep himself from being disabled in teamfights.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Earth Spirit is one of the strongest disabling heroes in the game, possessing a stun, silence and slow in all of his basic abilities, allowing him to combo his abilities based on the needs of his allies and how he wants to affect his enemies. By judiciously using his spells at the right time and in the right situation, he can inflict the enemy with powerful crowd control effects.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very dangerous roaming presence.<br/>Performs role well without items.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Requires precise positioning and timing.<br/>Mediocre lane presence if not playing aggressively.<br/>Somewhat level dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Due to the high potential impact of his spells, Earth Spirit is a relatively farm-independent hero, and can contribute greatly to ganks and teamfights with few to no items. He is best played as a utility initiator that can be useful without items but increases greatly in effectiveness with farm.<br/>Earth Spirit has little single-target physical damage, and his spells require the use of Stone Remnants in order to be effective. As such, it is difficult to farm with him, so he should get his gold by being active and getting kills and assists in teamfights and ganks.<br/>Positioning is key with Earth Spirit; this hero is adept at initiating, counter-initiating and running down fleeing foes. All of his spells allow him to disable enemies in some form or another, so being within range to cast his spells can allow him to turn the tide of any teamfight.<br/> Earth Spirit can generally be played in numerous roles, depending on what is needed by his team.
<br/>Most commonly, Earth Spirit is played as a solo off-laner, as he possesses survivability due to being a strength hero and has an escape in Rolling Boulder. Getting solo experience in the off-lane allows him to get fast early levels, which in turn allows him to use his abilities to devastate his opponents and greatly disrupt the enemy's safe lane. He can then transition into roaming and ganking with his spells.<br/>As a roamer, Earth Spirit can use his wide array of disables to set up kills on enemies in their lanes. While he will not get much farm or experience, he can appear without warning in any enemy lane and disable enemies for kills, giving his teammates strong lane advantages.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Earthshaker is a powerful spellcaster designed to repeatedly stun enemies. However, his naturally low mana requires careful management and selective use, especially during the early game. His Echo Slam allows him to wipe out large groups of enemies, making him an ideal pick against heroes like Chaos Knight, Meepo, Broodmother, or Phantom Lancer. Compared to intelligence supports, Earthshaker has a sizeable health pool. But compared to most strength heroes, Earthshaker is fairly vulnerable and can be easily killed if caught out of position.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Numerous stuns.<br/>Excellent initiation.<br/>Good early ganking.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low mana.<br/>Long cast animations.<br/>Easy to harass in lane.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Due to his costly abilities, Earthshaker needs good timing and game sense to be effective.<br/>In the early game, Earthshaker is very easy to harass in lane. Players should play conservatively except when setting up a gank with his allies.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Elder Titan is a very flexible hero who can provide great amounts of utility to his team through his abilities, depending on how he is built. He can use Astral Spirit to accrue great amounts of bonus damage and movement speed, and then take advantage of Natural Order to inflict that bonus damage on enemies when their defenses are reduced. He is also capable of disabling multiple enemy heroes at once with a combination of Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp, as well as set up strong slows and deal tremendous damage with Earth Splitter after landing a successful Echo Stomp.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Wide area disable.<br/>Anti-tank aura.<br/>Can deal high physical damage as a support.<br/>Good scouting ability.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Mediocre stat growths.<br/>Difficult to land spells.<br/>Low mana.<br/>Requires some micro-management.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>In general, due to being a strength melee hero, Elder Titan benefits greatly from building durability items. After increasing his tankiness, he can transition into carrying defensive auras and teamfight items, which can give his team an edge in fights.<br/> Depending on your team composition and level of play, Elder Titan's skills have differing priorities to max. Level Echo Stomp to increase the sleep's duration, making it easier for Elder Titan and his team to set up their own spells without disturbance. Astral Spirit provides the highest overall damage increase in a single spell, allowing Elder Titan to deal damage from the spirit passing through enemies as well as giving him bonus damage once it returns. Maxing Natural Order early massively increases the amount of damage enemies will take in engagements, allowing high damage dealers on Elder Titan's team to maximize their damage output.
<br/>If being built as a melee-range fighter, Elder Titan focuses on maxing out Astral Spirit and Natural Order, completely forgoing Echo Stomp and his ultimate to get four levels in both by level 8. By doing so, Elder Titan can cast Astral Spirit to maximize the amount of bonus damage and movement speed he gains by passing it through enemy units, and then engaging the enemy in direct combat to utilize the bonus damage and apply his Natural Order aura to enemies he is attacking to further increase the damage they take from his attacks. Because Astral Spirit is his only mana-costing ability, Elder Titan focuses on building durability items and increasing his attack speed, so that he can take the enemy head-on and maximize his damage output.<br/>Built as a utility initiator-disabler, Elder Titan gets only one value point in Astral Spirit, then focuses on maxing out Echo Stomp and Natural Order, while leveling his ultimate where possible. The objective of this build is to combine Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp in order to set up long-duration sleeps on enemies, and then weaken their defenses for teammates to exploit, using his ultimate both as a nuke and a disable. Because he lacks levels in Astral Spirit, Elder Titan will have little auto-attack damage output, and focuses on using his spells to great effect. Elder Titan must build items that grant him mana for sustaining his casting, mobility to let him more easily position himself to cast his spells, and utility items to help give his team an advantage in fights.<br/> Elder Titan is most often played as an off-laner, but can be played as a mid hero or safe-lane support depending on the lineup.
<br/>Astral Spirit allows an off-lane Elder Titan to get last-hits from distance, and he benefits from getting solo experience if the enemy supports fail to zone him out effectively. Additionally, the spirit can accrue bonus damage and movement speed via nearby jungle creeps as well as lane creeps, giving Elder Titan more mobility and last-hitting power as needed, and scout the fog of war for potential incoming ganks. A value point in Echo Stomp can serve as an emergency escape spell of sorts, as it can stop attackers in their tracks once they've expended their disables, allowing Elder Titan to escape while they are asleep.<br/>A mid Elder Titan can use a combination of Astral Spirit and Natural Order to bully his opponent, as he can gain bonus damage and movement speed through the spirit to trade right-clicks and chase the enemy mid down, while Natural Order's aura greatly increases the amount of damage they take from trading attacks. As well, Echo Stomp can be used to punish any enemies attempting to tower dive, or can aid in setting up friendly ganks.<br/>As a support, Elder Titan will have very little farm and experience priority, however he can remotely set up disables via Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp once he hits level 2, which can disable the enemy's off-laner long enough for his team to get in a favorable position for a gank. As well, he can transition into a utility farming support by passing his Astral Spirit through neutral camps in his jungle and then use the bonus damage to farm if needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Huskar is a resilient ranged attacker who sacrifices his own health to inflict greater damage. An injured Huskar attacks with incredible speed, making him frustratingly hard to kill even at the brink of death. His deadly Life Break is supremely suited to killing enemies one-on-one, especially during the early to mid game. Huskar's natural magic resistance prevents enemies from nuking him down while he finishes the job, then heals himself with Inner Vitality. He fulfills the roles of carry and ganker, although the damage over time from Burning Spears will not match heavier carries in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very resilient.<br/>Requires no mana management.<br/>Can turn fights around even at low health.<br/>Excellent early to mid game presence.<br/>Counters heavy magical damage.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Many counters.<br/>No disables.<br/>Low armor.<br/>Needs Regeneration items to Survive.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Huskar is not a true initiator. Try to let another team member initiate, then jump in to single out soft targets.<br/>A good amount of Huskar's damage comes from Burning Spear's magical burn damage, meaning that magic resistance makes Huskar much less effective.<br/>Huskar's abilities synergizes well with each other, Burning Spear and Life Break both use up health, and feed your Berserker's Blood increasing your damage output while Inner Vitality makes you more durable.<br/> Due to his low base , Huskar is susceptible to physical burst damage. 
<br/>Good examples of this is Clinkz and Sven as well as any carry who has a Daedalus or Desolator completed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Io is a unique hero that provides boosts to its allies by linking to them. While relatively powerless alone, Io can be extremely useful when paired with the appropriate heroes. It regenerates allies through Tether, and buffs their defense and attack speed with Overcharge. But most importantly, Io can Relocate an ally to any point on the map, setting up perfect ganks or saving that ally from certain death.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Not item dependent.<br/>Global mobility.<br/>Grealty increases one's durability.<br/>Low mana costs.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Dies very easily.<br/>Requires precise coordination with teammates.<br/>Useless alone.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Io is best played with a partner with whom you share communication.<br/>Io is extremely weak and can't do much alone. His utility comes entirely from boosting teammates.<br/>Io is expected to sacrifice its life to save another teammate.<br/>As a general rule, Io works best with a Carry who has mobility and health and/or mana regen issues; see the Counter page for some suggested Io Buddies.<br/>Tether heals his allies for 1.5x the healing done to Io itself. Don't forget this to save allies and in lane phase, when using items like Tango, Enchanted Mango and building items like Urn of Shadows and others.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Kunkka is a strategic fighter that relies on his carefully placed abilities to disrupt enemy formations. His skills complement one another, and need to be used in conjunction to be effective. With his Tidebringer, Kunkka can deal a good amount of damage to a large area in front of him. Playing Kunkka requires good timing, tactical thinking, and an understanding of enemy movement. If insufficiently farmed, however, Kunkka will barely do any damage, and must rely on landing his abilities if he is to remain useful to his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Large, disruptive AoE abilities with massive damage.<br/>Wide reach and crowd physical damage with Tidebringer.<br/>X Marks the Spot is a unique single target control ability.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>A hated target in teamfights and may be focused at first.<br/>Requires good timing to land ability combos.<br/>Ability damage falls off in the late game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Kunkka's abilities work best when the enemy team is clumped together. Time your ability usage accordingly.<br/> In general, carry Kunkka can be placed either mid or in the safe lane. 
<br/>As a mid, Kunkka should focus on getting early levels and harassing down the enemy's mid with Tidebringer, then using his spells to get early kills and farm his core items.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Legion Commander is ganking carry whose damage potential is theoretically unlimited. She is able to heal, buff herself and her allies with Press the Attack, and finish off enemies with Overwhelming Odds. With each victorious Duel, the Legion Commander becomes even more unstoppable. However, if she fails to win regular Duels, her damage may suffer as a result, rendering her much less useful as the game goes on.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Excellent snowballing potential.<br/>Tanky during laning phase.<br/>Prevent enemy from escaping.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Dependent on winning Duels.<br/>High mana cost during laning phase.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Even though Legion Commander is technically a carry, she needs to also gank early to increase her bonus damage from Duel. 
<br/>Be sure to take advantage of any ganking opportunities, instead of farming endlessly away from your team.<br/>Legion Commander works best in coordinated teams that can effectively soften and disable a target for her to kill with Duel, and thus snowball as a carry.<br/>During early to mid-game, try targeting the softer casters or supports, like Crystal Maiden and Shadow Shaman. This way, if you were to lose a Duel and they gain the bonus attack damage, it won't affect your team in the late-game as these heroes rely more on their spells than their attacks.<br/>Duel allows her to build a large amount of attack damage, meaning that to amplify her damage, it's most cost-effective to build items that reduce the enemy's armor or increases her attack speed, rather than buying items which add more damage.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lifestealer is a voracious flesh-eater who Feasts on his prey to regain his health, after inflicting them with deadly Open Wounds. Consumed by madness, he will go through vicious Rages that will grant him magic immunity and bonus attack speed. If he's especially hungry and desperate, he can Infest any creep and hide inside like a parasite, devouring him when he's finally released.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Built-in magic immunity (and some attack speed too).<br/>A great anti-tank.<br/>Pairs nicely with any mobile initiator.<br/>Infest can be great to use in the middle of a fight to heal you back up....<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>His only disable is a slow (granted, a decent one).<br/>His ultimate can be a little underwhelming, especially in the late game.<br/>Almost no AOE.<br/>.... IF (and only if) there's a nearby creep with lots of hp remaining.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>There is a term called the N'aix bomb among players which includes a N'aix player infesting a high mobility hero such as Storm Spirit, Puck, Queen of Pain, Magnus, Spirit Breaker and invisible heroes like, Riki and Nyx Assassin to initiate upon enemies by having these heroes enter the fray and unleashing all of their own spells in quick succession before N'aix himself comes out of them and dealing the nuke damage of Infest while following it up with his DPS using Rage.<br/>It is possible to solo Roshan if you are a higher leveled Lifestealer, although it takes a very long time. To do this, you keep attacking Roshan until you reach low health, then go to the nearby Radiant Jungle, and use your abilities to heal, then go back to Roshan and repeat the process. If you plan on doing this, be careful of enemy wards anywhere nearby, as if you get ganked by the enemy team you have a low chance of surviving.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lycan is a remarkable pusher and split-pusher that can wear down the enemies and force them to react quickly to his regular tower onslaughts; as towers melt incredibly fast under his and his minions' pressure, boosted by their canine Feral Impulse. His only contribution to full-on team fights will be the bonus damage he grants with Howl to his allies, his allies' summons, his owns summons and himself... And his formidable right-click power. Else he can surge out of the woods for a quick gank or push after he transformed with Shapeshift, moving at a speed of 650. Finally, good players will make the best usage of his Summon Wolves ability and scout the enemies' position while remaining undetected since they're invisible when maxed out.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great jungler.<br/>Can take out Roshan by himself.<br/>Terrific pusher.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Can require some help in the laning stage.<br/>Reliant on BKB for protection.<br/>No reliable disables.<br/>Little team fight contribution.<br/>Needs correct micro-management and decision-making to get the most out of him.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Because your Howl immobilize Lycan use it just before Shapeshift.<br/>When taking on Roshan, it is advised to use a Smoke of Deceit to avoid being spotted by enemy observer wards. Teams facing a Lycan will do their best to prevent early Roshan kills by planting observer wards near the pit; given that a detected Lycan is easy prey while doing battle with Roshan, slipping past those wards will do wonders for his lifespan.<br/>At level 7, with items like Vladmir's Offering and Power Treads or Medallion of Courage, Lycan can solo Roshan. Summon your Wolves and tank them alternately with the hero, but do not let them die until the re-summon is ready. Keep Shapeshift just in case the enemy comes for you, so you can escape.<br/>Any item that provides armor reduction (Desolator, Medallion, Assault Cuirass) or an aura benefits both the wolves and the Necronomicon units. Keep in mind that the melee Necronomicon Warrior has the lowest Base Attack Time of the game of 0.75 seconds, which makes him scale really well with Howl's flat damage bonus. Adding reduced armor to the mix will considerably increase your total DPS.<br/>You can buy a Scythe of Vyse to disable and slow your enemy from distance to hunt him.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Magnus is one of the few melee heroes who can solo the middle lane well, because of his skill set. Shockwave allows him to safely get last hits while also harassing the lane opponent. His ultimate, Reverse Polarity, is an extremely important ability for teamfights, allowing him to stun and group up enemies hit into a small area in front of him, which can then be moved through Skewer. It is ideal for him especially if he is needed to be a carry in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great teamfighter thanks to Reverse Polarity and Skewer.<br/>Can be played as right-clicker.<br/>Compliments the team's late-game carry.<br/>Good hero to pick off with.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Only useful in the late-game because of Reverse Polarity.<br/>Has mana problems because of high-mana cost spells and spamming Shockwave.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Most of Magnus' abilities work effectively only if his targets are in front of him. When surrounded, Magnus will be forced to change directions too much, not only delaying him from casting spells in rapid succession, but also rendering his spells' area-of-effects useless. As such, place Magnus in the side lines, or until his enemies are in a manageable range in front of him. You should only place yourself in the middle when planning to cast your ultimate, Reverse Polarity, since it forces all of the targets you hit to be in front of you.<br/>Magnus players need to communicate with the team because his initiations are most likely to be sudden.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Night Stalker is a strong early game ganker during the night. Night Stalker depends greatly on darkness in order to be effective as his abilities greatly increase in strength during the night. If left unchecked, Night Stalker can snowball by getting kills after kills in the early game and controlling the map in the mid-later stages of the game with superior night vision. Night Stalker is not a strong team fighter and should be using superior vision and map control to dictate when and where team fights should occur.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Superior night vision allows Night Stalker to control the map and scout effectively to jump on an unsuspecting lone hero or retreat safely from a scouted gank.<br/>Bulky<br/>High night presence, allowing to shut down individual targets with a semispammable slow, miss chance and silence debuff and chase them down with superior move speed.<br/>Great for hit and run gank tactics<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Weak in team fights due to the lack of strong area of effect spells and ultimate<br/>Weak during day time, forced to play around night time.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Poor lane phase.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Unlike other heroes in the game, Night Stalker has below-maximum sight range in the daytime, with only 1200 compared to most other heroes' 1800. However, he more than compensates for this by possessing 1800 night vision, a value only equaled by a few other heroes in the game and more than double the rest. This means that while Night Stalker is relatively easy to sneak up on and gank in daylight, he possesses powerful situational awareness at night, which can allow him to use his abilities to the utmost.<br/> Because of his reliance on levels to be effective in the early game, as well as need for items to take advantage of his passive, Night Stalker is best played as a core hero.
<br/>In many situations, Night Stalker can be a very strong solo mid-laner. His excellent base damage and high base armor allow him to get last-hits and denies fairly reliably, and he benefits greatly from solo experience as he can take advantage of the levels once the first night hits. As well, being mid gives him the option of ganking either top or bottom without the need for a Town Portal Scroll, as he can reach either lane easily and quickly due to Hunter in the Night.<br/>As he can be very strong with just early levels, Night Stalker can be a relatively strong off-laner. His high base strength and armor, along with respectable base damage allow him to survive relatively easily in the off-lane, and use his early levels to punish the enemy's safe-lane once the first night comes.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Omniknight is a defensive support who specializes in healing his allies with Purification and shielding them from damage with Repel and Guardian Angel. Unlike most other supports, he remains relevant in the late game as his abilities lack the type of scaling that makes them irrelevant against farmed enemies. Omniknight is generally played as a safe-lane support, but he can occasionally be played as an off-laner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Extremely powerful defensive abilities.<br/>Relatively tanky support.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Constant mana problems.<br/>Very vulnerable to silence.<br/>Abilities can be purged.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Omniknight should be built for survivability and focus on what is best to counter the enemy lineup. If they have lots of AoE dmg or silences, Guardian Greaves is best and most common on support Omniknights, since it can keep your team up longer and purge most debuffs.<br/>Due to his longer than normal cast animations, playing Omniknight well requires good positioning and planning ahead, as any hesitation can prevent him from getting his spells off in time.<br/>Omniknight is actually quite squishy without his own buffs applied to himself, which is why he needs to be in the back of the line of fire, or needs good counter items to keep him in the front of the fight. Items such as Mekansm or Lotus Orb.<br/>Since Omniknight is a melee support, he is incapable of harassing enemy off-laners effectively, and in turn can be prevented from supporting his lane through enemy harass.<br/>Silences are one of Omniknight's greatest weaknesses past the laning stage, as he must be able to cast his abilities in order to impact teamfights. Pre-emptively casting Repel on yourself can prevent the enemy from disabling you, although good positioning also stops enemies from initiating on Omniknight.<br/>Beware that while Omniknight's spells are very strong and can change the course of teamfights, Guardian Angel can be purged. This makes dispels that affect a large area, such as Tornado and Dispel Magic, one of Omniknight's greatest weaknesses, since it will negate his ultimate entirely when targeted properly. Also, dispels from items like Diffusal Blade and Eul's Scepter of Divinity will remove the buff from a single unit.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phoenix is a risk-reward, spell-dependent supportive initiator adept at placing debuffs on a wide area to hamper the enemy team's offensive capabilities and slowly burn their health away. Its abilities let it apply powerful slows, rain down heavy damage over time from a distance, and then cover a large area in a stellar inferno as it collapses into a scorching Supernova. Should enemies fail to destroy or escape it, they will be met with a spell immunity-piercing stun, allowing Phoenix and its allies to take advantage of the enemy and follow up with their other abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Long range on all of its abilities.<br/>Counters auto-attack dependent carries.<br/>Scaling magical damage along with healing.<br/>Capable of inflicting many debuffs on multiple enemies at once.<br/>Deceptively elusive and durable with the right order of spell usage.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>No true disables.<br/>Has almost no spell immunity piercing effects.<br/>Very ability and mana dependent.<br/>Requires precise and careful positioning, aim and timing.<br/>Low armor and has health costs along with mana costs on most abilities.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Quick timing, good positioning, order and aim are necessary for the perfect initiation as Phoenix. Cast Fire Spirits beforehand, concealing yourself from the enemy team so they will not expect your initiation, then try to Dive through as many enemy units as you can to inflict the movement speed slow debuff. During the Dive, try to cast Fire Spirits on as many heroes as possible and, if available, cast Veil of Discord and Shiva's Guard just right before you cast Supernova. If done in the right order and with quick enough casting, the Supernova would end up right in the middle of the fray, preventing the enemy from stunning you. Most, if not all, enemy units will be afflicted with all your debuffs, taking amplified damage and crippled with the slows, making the Supernova incredibly difficult to kill and/or flee from. Should an enemy stay within the ultimate's area for the whole duration, the enemy could take a total of, more or less, 1850 magical damage (provided the enemy has the base 25% magic resistance, with Veil of Discord's debuff factored in, adding 100 more damage if the +65 Fire Spirits DPS talent is chosen).<br/>Mana, armor and health regeneration are all Phoenix lacks but so direly needs. Consider buying Intelligence items to increase your mana pool, armor-increasing items for more survivability, and health regen items to "refund" the health costs its abilities use.<br/>If playing aggressively as an initiator, Phoenix is best played at either middle lane or offlane, where it can go solo and have as much gold and experience as it can get. Harass your lane opponents with your debuffs to prevent your opponents from obtaining last hits and denying you from your own.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Pudge is a fearsome ganker and one of the most renowned heroes in all of Dota. Played skillfully, he can dis-position enemies and set up kills for his team that would be otherwise impossible to accomplish.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Has a respectable health pool early game that grows even bigger later on.<br/>Very good ganker and roamer in the early game.<br/>One of the best tanks in the game, capable of being resistant to both magic and physical damage in late part of the game.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low armor at the early stages of the game.<br/>Sometimes he's very dependent on his teammates.<br/>Requires skills to land a normal hook, if playing as initiator-tank, a fail hook that supposed to initiate the battle could ruin the whole team fight<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>With his poor base armor and agility, Pudge is quite vulnerable to physical damage in the early game despite being a strength hero, and can be easily harassed down due to being a melee hero. As well, his extremely long attack animation makes him additionally easy to harass by lane opponents, so good positioning and knowledge of creep mechanics is necessary to survive in a lane.<br/>Because of his extremely powerful spells, Pudge is heavily reliant on building up his mana pool and increasing his poor mobility in order to be effective in teamfights. Try to build items that grant Pudge additional movement speed and burst movement to aid in positioning, intelligence items to increase the size of his poor base mana pool, and durability items to take advantage of his high strength growth.<br/> Given his skill set, Pudge can be played in any number of ways.
<br/>Traditionally, Pudge is played as a solo mid. While he is generally a weak laner due to being a melee hero, judicious and skillful use of his abilities lets him turn the tables on his lane opponent and score kills to give him an advantage. By being given solo experience and gold, Pudge can get an early level 6 and immediately begin roaming for kills, using his gold to purchase items to aid him to this effect.<br/>Given his strong utility and high strength gain, Pudge can sometimes be played as an off-laner, both solo and with a lane partner. While he lacks the survivability and escape abilities of traditional off-laners, he can greatly disrupt the enemy safe lane with Meat Hook, which can get kills on the enemy supports under optimal circumstances. If partnered with a teammate with good kill potential, Pudge can foul the enemy carry's attempts to farm safely and reduce their effectiveness later in a match.<br/>Lacking other options, Pudge can serve as a strong utility support in the safe lane. While he is unable to effectively harass the enemy off-laner with his spells, he can dis-position them with Meat Hook and slow them with Rot during ganks and kill attempts, giving his team early kills to boost their gold gain. He can also safely and reliably obtain gold and experience through pulling creep camps, which keeps lane creep equilibrium closer to his team's tower where he can more easily get in position to gank them.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sand King is an Initiator, escaper, and a carry if you have enough gold to do so.He suffers from low initial damage but compensates with his semi-nuke passive (An attack modifier).<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Stuns that can be used as both, initiation and escape<br/>Provides a good AoE in the game which is devastating early-game<br/>Great in laning phases with his passive<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Has little health pool that can be taken advantage of by nukes<br/>Ultimate scales poorly into late game<br/>Low mana pool makes spellcasting in early game difficult<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Generally, Sand King is played as a support hero who transitions into an initiator-utility once the laning stage ends. As such, he generally performs support duties for his team during the laning stage, such as purchasing Observer Wards and/or the Animal Courier, as well as upgrading the courier and purchasing Smoke of Deceit when needed.<br/>If needed, Sand King can also be played as an early off-laner, as Burrowstrike and Sand Storm offer him measures of escape, and he generally needs levels before he can farm for gold to get his items. Even if he does not get farm in the off-lane, reaching level 3 or 4 can allow him to transition into his jungle to farm neutral camps with Sand Storm.<br/>Sand King's greatest strengths are his instant cast times and high-mobility spells that allow him to initiate or escape without worrying about cast animations. He can be a very deadly ganker who is nearly impossible to escape, or an extremely slippery target who can evade even the most determined ganks.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Slardar is a physical damage-based carry who specializes in chasing down and crushing his foes. While he is very straightforward and easy to learn, mastering his abilities can allow players to unlock his true potential.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High Physical Damage<br/>Powerful Carry potential<br/>High Armor and fast attack speed<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Sluggish Mobility<br/>Quite item dependent<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Bash of the Deep average stats (hero)<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Spirit Breaker usually serve as an initiator/ganker/tanker role in the team. His skillset allows/requires player to consistently checking for any ganking opportunity across the map meanwhile helping his team secure space and farm. If he does so, a successful early-mid game Barathrum can snowball into a semi-carry and crush his foes relentlessly, carving a path to victory for his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great ganker thanks to global initiation and durability<br/>Can stunlock a target for a long period of time<br/>Can solo-kill fragile heroes after charging at them from anywhere<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very poor teamfight contribution<br/>Unreliable Bash, mainly due to slow attack speed<br/>Heavily countered by decent vision on the map and sticking together<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Greater Bash average stats<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sven is the embodiment of strength, a mighty front line fighter capable of dealing tremendous physical damage to groups of foes at once. A well farmed Sven can destroy an enemy in just a few hits, overpowering other carries with sheer burst damage. However, Sven is vulnerable to kiting and disables, and generally has a slower attack speed than most carries.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very high melee damage.<br/>Good at clearing groups.<br/>Reliable AoE stun.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low mana.<br/>Low attack speed.<br/>Highly dependent on Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Ranged heroes can easily harass Sven in lane. Make sure he is paired with a support hero.<br/>Sven is very easy to shut down with good crowd control. Therefore, Sven players need to know exactly when to use their Black King Bar, and when to conserve the charge.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tidehunter is a very durable hero who brings disables and debuffs to the field. He focuses on debilitating the enemy and shrugging off their attempts to disable and kill him, as he is capable of absorbing a tremendous amount of punishment should the enemy attempt to focus him down to prevent him from inhibiting them in teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>(One of) the best team fight ultimate in the game.<br/>His durability gives you a chance to survive your own mistakes.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Not a huge damage output.<br/>Quite mana-dependent in the early game.<br/>Kraken Shell doesn't purge everything.<br/>Better opponents will know when they've got an actual shot at killing you.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Because of his innate toughness and strong array of debuffs, Tidehunter generally benefits from building mobility items that aid him in initiating with his ultimate (particularly a Blink Dagger), as well as items that improve his ability to cast his spells. Tidehunter's poor intelligence means that he must increase the size of his mana pool if he is to sustain his ability to cast his disables and debuffs.<br/> Tidehunter can be played as an initiator or a tank, or some combination in between.
<br/>Due to the immense disable potential of Ravage, getting a Blink Dagger allows Tidehunter to initiate fights by stunning the entire team for a long duration. After getting off a successful Ravage, he can follow up with Anchor Smash while the enemy is still disabled, reducing their ability to attack effectively, and then Gush to slow any stragglers, preventing them from easily escaping.<br/>While he possesses strong initiating power with Ravage, Tidehunter can also discourage enemies from engaging by standing at the front lines and debilitating their ability to fight. Should the enemy choose to engage him, he can greatly reduce their base damage with Anchor Smash while also shrugging off their attacks and debuffs with Kraken Shell, and threaten them with a Ravage should they all jump on him.<br/> Tidehunter's flexibility allows him to be played either as a safe-lane support or solo off-laner. His skill and item build differs drastically depending on which path is taken.
<br/>Played as a support, Tidehunter should focus on purchasing support items and harassing the enemy's off-laner. Generally he gets his Blink Dagger much later, if at all, due to not being given farm or experience priority. Anchor Smash can discourage the enemy from approaching lest they take damage and have their last-hitting power greatly reduced, and Gush can slow them for chain-disables and kills.<br/>Played as an off-laner, Tidehunter should focus on surviving while also harassing the enemy's carry and supports. Kraken Shell allows Tidehunter to ignore the enemy's harass damage, while he can use Anchor Smash to harass the enemy down and prevent their carry from getting easy last-hits. Off-lane Tidehunter benefits greatly if the enemy's carry (and optionally supports as well) is also melee, as they must approach the creep wave to last-hit, making casting Anchor Smash much easier.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Timbersaw is an armored brawler who relies on cutting down trees as a mechanic for rapid movement and dealing damage. In the early and mid stages of the game, Timbersaw can be surprisingly durable, staying in the fight and taking out multiple opponents even on the verge of death. His pure damage penetrates armor and magic resistance, making him deadly against all opponents. However, Timbersaw lacks any true disables, and must rely on his mobility to keep up with his enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Highly mobile.<br/>High armor.<br/>High HP regeneration<br/>Deals pure damage.<br/>High mana capacity.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>No disables.<br/>Entirely dependent on abilities to deal damage.<br/>Low HP.<br/>Very dependent on Bloodstone<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>One of Timbersaw's weaknesses is his lack of disabling spells; he suffers against heroes that excel at channeling spells to harm their opponents. In this case, equip him with an item that has a quick disable, like Eul's Scepter of Divinity.<br/>Aside from escape, Timbersaw's skill set also makes for good chasing. Cut down trees that get in your way to widen your path and even prevent juking.<br/>The trees summoned by Nature's Prophet through Sprout are still standard trees. As an enemy, you can easily cut them down to escape, or free allies who are trapped within it. As an ally, this can be used to your advantage when escaping (as Nature's Prophet can summon trees in a convenient location for you to use Timber Chain) or when fighting (Nature's Prophet can summon trees closer to you when no other tree is present, so that you can deal pure damage when casting Whirling Death).<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tiny is a heavy carry with a large amount of health. He is the only hero in the game that grows as he levels up. In the early game, he uses his Avalanche > Toss combo to gank and deal burst damage. As he acquires more items, Tiny transitions into a full-fledged carry, capable of wiping entire teams with his tree, and demolishing buildings in very little time. With a Blink Dagger, Tiny also makes an effective initiator. However, Tiny is susceptible to disables, and can be shut down by intense harassment in the early game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High early game burst damage.<br/>High late game AoE damage.<br/>Passive counters melee carries.<br/>High damage against buildings.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low mana.<br/>Needs a good early game.<br/>Very bad starting armor and agility growth<br/>Low attack speed without items<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Tiny has high base attack damage, which makes last hitting a breeze.<br/>Tiny suffers from low mana. In the early game, one ability or ability combo will often use up all his mana.<br/>Tiny has poor lane presence and should be supported by another hero if necessary.<br/>Tiny has great strength gain, but poor intelligence and agility gain.<br/>Despite his appearance, Tiny has fairly low armor and can be quite vulnerable to physical attacks.<br/>While Tiny has the potential to be a relentless force in the late game, his scaling process is delicate. Good players must know how to farm well in the early game to keep pace with other carries.
<br/>A poorly farmed Tiny will become a burden to his team in the mid and late game.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Treant Protector is a tough support hero who is able to protect and regenerate allies and friendly buildings with his trademark ability, Living Armor. Hiding himself with Nature's Guise and packing a huge bash, he is one of few supports that can sneak past enemy lines to set up ganks and/or initiate a fight by trapping the opposing team in an Overgrowth. Alone, Treant Protector does little damage and requires good teamwork to be effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Global range with Living Armor.<br/>Fairly tanky.<br/>Can heal buildings.<br/>Highest base physical damage in the game at Lvl 1.<br/>AoE Magic Immunity piercing root and disarm.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Easily countered by vision and true sight.<br/>Very dependent on teammates.<br/>Little offensive power (due to high defensive power).<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Treant Protector's attack animation and rate are slow, but pack a huge punch. With a little practice, he can put that power to use and greatly assist his lane partner by denying units.<br/>Because of his high damage and strength, Treant Protector can sometimes jungle weaker creep camps.<br/>Treant Protector is not very mobile and requires careful positioning, especially before a teamfight.<br/>Keep your eyes over the entire game. Treant Protector can keep allies longer in lane, save them from ganks and heal damaged towers with Living Armor.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tusk is a very strong initiator who can set up fights on his team's terms. His arsenal of crowd control spells can greatly inhibit enemies during fights and ganks, giving allies a powerful edge. Tusk is a ganking specialist as he can hunt fragile heroes throughout the game. However, his skill and aggressive play style can be a double edge against him when it comes to initiating & chasing fleeing enemies as his ice shard can block his teammates from proceed with the chase and he can roll himself into a counter-ganking trap set up by his opponent. Thus, although his skillset is rather straightforward, player should exercise good judgement before consider initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Quite versatile in role.<br/>Powerful disable abilities, especially his ultimate.<br/>High Movement Speed without Boots.<br/>Specialize in ganking.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Quite weak without Desolator or Shadow Blade<br/>Even though he is a strength hero, he has low health<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Beware that while Tusk is a strength hero with strong disables, his mediocre strength growth means that his HP pool will not improve drastically with levels, which inhibits his ability to survive initiations. As such, Tusk benefits from building durability items to give himself more HP and armor, allowing him to do more in fights.<br/>Tusk's reliance on mana-expensive abilities in order to be effective means that he requires a source of mana replenishment in order to keep him in fights. The low cooldown on all of his abilities except Frozen Sigil means that he can greatly impact fights so long as he has the mana to cast his spells.<br/>Keep in mind that Tusk has a near-instant 0.1 second cast animation, allowing him to get his spells off very quickly. Good reflexes are necessary in order to make the most of Tusk's spells.<br/>Beware that while Tusk has a strong arsenal of disables, all of them are very short in duration. As such, while Tusk is a strong initiator, he cannot lock down enemies solely by himself, and requires additional disablers on his team in order to take advantage of the disruption he creates amongst the enemy.<br/> Due to his strong array of disables and an ultimate that scales with his damage, Tusk can be played in any number of ways.
<br/>Because he can be strong with only levels and does not explicitly require gold, Tusk can be a good support who gets his gold and levels by assisting his carries and setting up kills for them. Because of lack of farm priority, a support Tusk should focus on building cheap utility items and extending the size of his mana pool in order to take utmost advantage of his spells.<br/>Tusk's powerful disables allow him to be played as a roamer who can initiate and set up ganks for teammates. A roaming Tusk is much more active on the map and, given the proper circumstances, can get good gold and levels through kills and assists, hampering the enemy's early game and creating space for his allies to secure an early advantage in a match.<br/>Played as a semi-carry solo off-laner, Tusk can get fast early levels and gold, transitioning into becoming an effective ganker early in a game. He can use his gold to purchase items to give him more fighting power, increasing the potency of Walrus PUNCH! and improving his ability to initiate and survive in fights.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Underlord is a durable support who takes charge on the battlefield, creating dangerous hazards over large areas, while teleporting his team across the map with Dark Rift. He excels at trapping enemies in a Pit of Malice, and blunting physical damage inside his Atrophy Aura. With the health of a strength hero and the extra damage from Atrophy Aura, Underlord can stand his ground better than most supports. However, Underlord is slow and lumbering, and often suffers from insufficient mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Excellent zoning abilities.<br/>Tankier than most supports.<br/>Reduces enemy damage.<br/>Strong potential for sudden pushes.<br/>Not item dependent.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low mana.<br/>Damage scales poorly into the late game.<br/>Requires good team coordination.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Because of the long durations on Firestorm and Pit of Malice, Underlord specializes in area denial, zoning enemies out in teamfights.<br/>Underlord does not have a lot of mana. Use his abilities strategically.<br/>Underlord should remain close to his team, and be present at all fights to make good use of Atrophy Aura.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Undying usually serve as a lane support/tanker role in the team. His skillset allows player to harass enemy off the lane meanwhile helping his carry to secure space to farm. Dirge truly shines during every coordinated teamfight due to his plague aura and tombstone, forcing his enemy to either kill him or suffer the debuff consequences.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Strong harassing ability<br/>Formidable team fight presence<br/>Can play extremely aggressively in the early game<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Relies on items and Decay stacks for durability due to mediocre Strength gain and abysmal Agility gain.<br/>Pathetic scaling into the late game unless incredibly farmed.<br/>No hard disables, needs to be relatively close to enemies in order to contribute to fights.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Undying can be played in many ways: if you are going for a more supportive role, use your Tombstone and your Flesh Golem to slow the enemies while spamming Decay, then let your lane partner get the kill. Otherwise, use Soul Rip to finish a Hero while there are many creeps nearby: this way it deals more damage.<br/>While initiating, use Tombstone and Flesh Golem, then Decay/Soul Rip: this way these abilities deal more damage.<br/>Though his spells are individually quite cheap, you almost always have mana problems since both Soul Rip and especially Decay are very spammable. Consider getting Arcane Boots during the laning phase, then disassembling it once you have enough to buy the remaining pieces of a Bloodstone. You can then convert your standard boots to Phase Boots allowing you the mobility and chase power to keep Flesh Golem's powerful aura on the right targets during a teamfight.<br/>Another good item for Undying in the early game is Soul Ring. After using Soul Ring, you can cast decay for free. If you hit 2 or more heroes with this spell, you make up for the HP cost for Soul Ring.<br/>If you do not have enough gold to buy a Bloodstone in time or you would prefer cheaper items, try to make yourself as tanky as possible: if you are initiating, enemies target you first. That is why you need an early Vanguard and/or a Hood of Defiance if the opposing team has a lot of nukers. Other useful items that increase your HP are Rod of Atos, which solves most of your mana problems too, and Heart of Tarrasque.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Wraith King is a durable carry with a reliable stun. As his ultimate, Reincarnation, effectively doubles his health in a teamfight, he is commonly built as a tank carry. He is traditionally popular among new players for his survivability and potentially simple playstyle. However, Wraith King can also be played at a high level of skill, particularly by using active items.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great durability<br/>High Survivability<br/>Reliable Stun<br/>Rather easy to learn<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low mana pool<br/>Slow attack speed and movement speed<br/>Low armor in early to mid game<br/>Mostly countered by heroes who can mana burn<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/> Due to Wraith King's sustainability, he usually should initiate fights and tank up some damage first. Sometimes, it is great to even die first, triggering  which heavily slows every nearby enemy. At this point, the enemies usually either prepare to take him down again, or try to escape when they can't take him down a second time. This is the perfect opportunity for Wraith King's team to follow up and catch the enemies off-guard.
<br/>Besides these, dying as last as Wraith King basically just wastes his Reincarnation, since he cannot do much on his own after respawning besides dying a second time right away.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Anti-Mage is one of the most mobile carries in the game, mostly well known for his ability to punish lineups heavily reliant on magic damage with Spell Shield giving him very high magic resistance and his Mana Void can be used to cause massive damage to heroes with huge mana pools. His Blink makes him one of the fastest farmers in the game, with the ability to jump from creep camp to creep camp and quickly clear them with few items. Anti-Mage is however incredibly reliant on items to unlock his true potential, having a very low strength gain and no way of locking down enemy heroes makes him a very vulnerable hero if he does not have enough farm.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Extremely mobile and hard to catch.<br/>High attack speed.<br/>Scales well into late game.<br/>Punishes heroes who rely on mana.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low Strength and Intelligence gain.<br/>Reliant on Battle Fury to farm<br/>Very reliant on farm to scale.<br/>Needs a decent support in lane to get good farm.<br/>Can be shut down in the early game.<br/>Weak against gankers that disable if overextended.<br/>Countered by heroes who aren't 100% dependent to mana, such as Huskar<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>You are utterly useless in team fights if you can't physically attack enemies. There are many ways to counter raw physical damage in DotA, especially if it's melee. Decent players will buy items like Scythe of Vyse, Blade Mail and Ghost Scepter to shut you down. Timing your entrance into the battle is everything for you.<br/>Do not pick Anti-Mage if your team picks farmers such as Shadow Fiend, Enigma, or Tinker.<br/>If you find yourself being killed quickly a Vitality Booster provides 250 health and can be later built into a Heart of Tarrasque. Generally, it is advisable to get a faster Manta Style.<br/>A quick Battle Fury will greatly increase your farming ability which will greatly help later in the game.<br/>Don't only farm the jungle. If the enemy is pushing Anti-Mage can push a different lane solo with a reliable escape mechanism with Blink and Town Portal Scroll and can indirectly defend by forcing the enemy to defend. It will require at least 1 core to respond to kill you generally giving your team a huge advantage if you TP back home to fight.<br/>Be very wary of heroes like Shadow Demon, Dark Seer and Morphling, as illusions created from you carry the Mana Break spell as well, and combined with Anti-Mage's high Agility, could easily turn the tides of a teamfight.<br/>Once you get full slotted you could opt to sell your Battle Fury for a different item, but its creep clearing abilities are still very useful and sometimes critical. You should sell it if you absolutely need another item that can turn the tides, such as a Monkey King Bar.<br/>Many players are tempted to switch Power Treads to agility, but given your low strength gain (1.2), it may be better to keep them on strength if you are not jungling.<br/>If under a lot of harass in lane, it can be worth it to get a Ring of Regeneration on top of your Ring of Health and later use that to build a Vladmir's Offering. Vlad's allows Anti-Mage to solo Roshan and also farm at full health while also being able to jungle ancients efficiently.<br/>It can be a good idea to finish a hero with your ultimate, even if you could easily kill with an autoattack. Chances are a hero you focused is running low on mana and its team trying to save would come in close enough for your ultimate to hit quite a few enemies.<br/>Even with Black King Bar, you should avoid being an initiator and instead bide your time until you can exploit a weak spot in the enemy's formation after a team fight starts, usually in the back lines where the supports are. This is especially important if the enemy carry is on the front lines with a BKB, which is a fight you will almost never win head on.<br/>Even though you have poor strength gain, your starting strength and armor is actually very decent. Couple that with your naturally fast attack speed and a single point in mana break makes you very strong in trading hits.<br/>With the above tip in mind against some common offlane heroes like Windranger and Mirana who try to harass you it's a good idea to constantly blink on them to trade hits as early as you're level 2, rather than simply withstanding harass. Setting the pace for the laning is critical to how fast you farm later in the game.<br/>Your laning phase is an absolute nightmare. Many heroes can cripple your early game by harassing you and chasing you away. Also, if you don't utilize your laning phase the game may well end before you reach Anti-Mage's maximum potential. Ask your teammates to babysit you.<br/>Anti-Mage has relatively low base health. If you can't kill an enemy quickly, it may be best to disengage, as an unfavorable fight can easily result in your own death.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Arc Warden is a carry that can nuke enemies early and then split push to end the game. His health, armor, and mana early on are fairly low, but they still give him enough to last in lane and nuke foes with his combo. His health and mana grow to respectable degrees later on, but his agility still suffers. His biggest detriments throughout the game are no mobility skills, needing to micromanage, and his abilities suffering vs multiple heroes. Nonetheless, a Warden who gets farmed is a foe to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Highest base strength and Intelligence of all agility heroes, and highest Intelligence growth.<br/>Can easily nuke most enemies 1v1<br/>Split Pushes extremely well with Tempest Double<br/>One of the most versatile heroes in the game<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Second lowest base agility and agility gain of all agility heroes<br/>0.1 base armor makes him susceptible to physical harassment early on.<br/>Slow movement speed with no mobility skills makes it hard for him to escape if ganked.<br/>Needs items to farm quickly, no ability outside of his ult helps him with farming.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Arc Warden is squishy early on with no escape tools. Pair him with a support if Safe Lane, or if heading mid make sure to keep wards up so you can see incoming ganks and know when it's time to fall back<br/>Warden's abilities are strongest in a 1v1 situation. As such, placing him mid can see him easily dominate most other heroes there and gain a gold advantage.<br/>Never skip Hand of Midas. Warden needs it to farm as he has no way to farm in his abilities, but he absolutely needs items. He also gains the hugest benefit out of it because his Tempest Double can use Midas with the gold and XP going to the main Warden.<br/>Consumables like Healing Salve, Enchanted Mango, Clarity and Bottle cannot be copied by the Tempest Double.<br/>Arc Warden can have potentially unlimited uses of Items with charges such as Drum of Endurance and Diffusal Blade if at least 1 charge is kept on the main Arc Warden, then only used on the Tempest Double, However, Black King Bar charges are used on both Arc Warden and his Tempest Double.<br/> Items that place buffs or debuffs can have their duration doubled if timed right, as well as perhaps correcting any mistakes the main Arc Warden has made (such as targeting the wrong unit).
<br/>Items that place buffs on allies, such as Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb, can be used on the main Arc Warden for increased protection and then using the main one's own to their allies, or vice versa.<br/>The Double can use teleport items such as Town Portal Scroll or Boots of Travel. This means while the main Arc Warden is somewhere else, farming, pushing or defending, the Double can be on the opposite side of the map contributing to a gank or farm the enemy jungle easily.<br/> Using  with the Double grants the player the gold and 2.5x experience. The Double maintains the cooldown while it is unsummoned. This means that the double will not be able to use the item with every summon and Arc Warden must time the Double's summon to get the full benefits of the extra Midas.
<br/>One Hand of Midas on the hero results in (190/100*60=)114 gold per minute if used whenever it is off cooldown. For the Tempest Double, the gold per minute is (190/100*60=) 114 gold per minute, resulting in 228 gold per minute for the player when both are always used when off cooldown, 2 times more than other heroes with one purchased Midas.<br/>It is wise to use the Double to farm or stack neutral camps if it has nothing else to do with its remaining duration for more efficiency and to gain more gold and experience.<br/>It is very important to not allow an enemy Rubick to steal Tempest Double, since the ability fully works for Rubick. As Tempest Double is the only ability which the doubles have already on cooldown when summoned, this means Spell Steal is completely available to use for a Rubick Double, fully able to steal and cast a spell as the same way the original Rubick. Wisely managed and well timed, Rubick and its doubles can steal and cast important ultimates such as Black Hole or Reverse Polarity with ease.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bloodseeker is a snowballing carry who grows faster and stronger as his enemies get weaker. Like a shark in water, Bloodseeker detects injured enemies across the entire map and runs them down with unnatural speed through Thirst. His Rupture makes enemies bleed with every step, allowing him to gank targets with ease during the early game. Regaining health each time an enemy falls, Bloodseeker overwhelms enemy teams in fights, leaving little chance for turnarounds. However, Bloodseeker has no disables of his own, and must rely on his teammates to lock down targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Fast movement speed.<br/>Regains health by killing enemies.<br/>Good early ganker.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Has no disables.<br/>Vulnerable to enemy disables.<br/>Countered by tanks.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Bloodseeker should attempt to reach level six as soon as possible so he can start ganking with Rupture.<br/>Because of the damage and speed bonus from Thirst, Bloodseeker players should always keep an eye on the enemy team's overall health, no matter where they are.
<br/>An enemy team with low health means Bloodseeker has a significant advantage.<br/>Bloodseeker wins games by being aggressive and maintaining a kill advantage over the enemy team. Do not try to passively outfarm harder carries like Medusa or Spectre.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bounty Hunter is a strong utility support hero who helps his team by picking off the enemy one by one, increasing gold gain for his team and giving them opportunities to take map objectives while they outnumber the enemy. However, he is also very vulnerable since his low strength means that he can be easily killed if the enemy catches him while he approaches a target, particularly due to his reliance on Shadow Walk. As such, good judgment and map awareness are key when playing Bounty Hunter, as he must be able to successfully initiate on and kill his targets without the enemy retaliating.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High burst damage.<br/>Invisibility.<br/>Can counter other invisible heroes.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very squishy.<br/>Mana-dependent.<br/>Weak team fight presence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>One small advantage that Bounty Hunter possesses over other heroes is that he has 1000 night vision instead of the standard 800. This makes Bounty Hunter a powerful night hunter, as he can spot targets at night who cannot see him, and cast Track on them from the Fog of War.<br/>In general, it is wise to check the enemy's inventory any time they appear on the map, and be aware of all enemy players' positions on the map. Knowing if the enemy may place Sentry Wards to give warning of your approach, as well as if they have Dust of Appearance or Gem of True Sight, can save your life as you can prevent yourself from walking into a trap. Additionally, knowing that certain enemies are on another part of the map will allow you to kill your target in the knowledge that their allies cannot reach them in time.<br/>When playing Bounty Hunter, it is important to stay off the map as much as possible once the laning stage ends. Keep the enemy guessing on where you are, so that they second-guess their decision to farm their own jungle, or push a lane too far forward, or go to any part of the map by themselves, for fear of being found and killed by you and your teammates. By doing so, you can destroy the enemy's economy as they will be too preoccupied worrying about you and not be spending time farming, giving your team space to out-farm them and get a strong gold and level advantage.<br/>Bounty Hunter is best played as an off-laner or roamer.<br/>As an off-laner, Bounty Hunter should attempt to block the enemy's pull camp so that he can get last-hits closer to his tower, and use Shadow Walk to sap experience if needed. As well, using an Observer Ward to block the enemy's pull camp can, depending on the ward's specific location, alert you to any incoming rotations by the enemy's supports, or let you see if the enemy is ferrying detection items to themselves with their courier in order to counter Shadow Walk.<br/>As a roamer, Bounty Hunter should generally focus on helping out in ganks by using Shadow Walk to approach an enemy who gets out of position during laning, adding his damage output to gank attempts. While he lacks contribution besides his right-clicks and body-blocking at level 1, once he has a level or two he can add his skills to the mix.<br/>Early play with Bounty Hunter can allow him to snipe the enemy's courier from invisibility, under optimal circumstances. As he can wait for the enemy's courier invisibly with Shadow Walk, he can choose to kill it as it approaches the enemy's mid to deliver their Bottle, or snipe it as it tries to ferry detection items to their safe lane supports. However, it requires good game sense and map awareness to know where the courier might appear, so this tactic is only viable at higher levels of gameplay.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Broodmother is hero made to pressure the lanes early. While she excels at split-pushing the lanes and taking towers with her army of spiderlings, she cannot carry the game by herself and normally needs to coordinate with her team to finish the game in a timely manner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Strong split-pusher.<br/>Very strong kill potential early game.<br/>Can farm enemy jungle.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Predictable play style due to lack of global presence.<br/>Damage scales off late game.<br/>Often forces own team to play 4 vs 5.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Broodmother is usually played alone in the offlane, as the invisibility and regeneration from her webs allow her to face off against multiple opponents.<br/>Broodmother is arguably the best early lane pusher in the game. A good player must take advantage of this.<br/>An aggressive Broodmother can often take down a tier two tower while other players are still farming.<br/>Beware of enemy Sentry Wards in lane. It is often worth it to buy your own Sentry Wards to detect and destroy the enemy wards.<br/>Remember that you can use Tangos, or a Quelling Blade to take out Sentry Wards quickly.<br/>Broodmother is very effective against solitary targets, but against multiple enemies she suffers; as her lifesteal can generally only replenish the damage taken from a solitary foe.<br/>Broodmother's primary escape mechanism is to move into her webs onto impassable terrain when attacked.<br/>Although Broodmother is usually pushing lanes alone, she is still sometimes needed in teamfights. It is important when playing her to know the right time to push, and when to team fight.<br/>Though Broodmother excels in the hard lane, she can also control and farm parts of the enemy jungle.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Clinkz is a great all around ranged carry with high offensive burst damage. Though frail and easy to kill, Skeleton Walk grants Clinkz stealth and haste to escape and re-position himself. This skill is also what makes Clinkz such an incredible ganker. His Searing Arrows provide huge bonus damage, greatly injuring enemies in conjunction with Strafe. Despite his high damage, Clinkz has no disabling abilities, and has difficulty killing enemies once they move out of range.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Invisible ganker.<br/>Very high attack damage.<br/>Destroys buildings quickly.<br/>High movement speed.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very fragile.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Slow attack animation.<br/>Easily countered by true sight.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Clinkz has one of the slowest attack animations in the game. Time his attacks carefully to get last hits.<br/>Clinkz relies on successful early to mid game ganks to be effective.<br/>The simplest way to gank is to go invisible with Skeleton Walk, position Clinkz behind an enemy, then activate Strafe before attacking to land as many arrows as possible.
<br/>This is made easier with an Orchid Malevolence, which prevents enemies from using a disable or escape ability.<br/>Enemies farming in the jungle are prime targets for Clinkz to gank with this tactic.<br/>The worst case scenario is for the target to simple move out of range before Clinkz lands enough arrows. Position Clinkz close to the target or wait until the target is distracted before breaking invisibility.<br/>While he can be an excellent ganker, Clinkz is extremely fragile and puts out huge amounts of DPS, making him a priority target in teamfights. Try to let teammates initiate while you dance around the edge of the fight dealing damage to distracted or disabled opponents.<br/>If you are focusing on early game ganking, level Strafe as your second ability to max as the decreased cooldown makes you a great threat.<br/>If you are playing as the team's late game carry, maxing Skeleton Walk keeps Clinkz safe and able to move quickly into untaken lanes and the jungle to farm.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Drow Ranger is a deadly archer, chilling and killing her enemies with volleys of Frost Arrows. With one of the highest agility stats in the game, her powerful shots will tear through most enemies from a safe distance. Her Precision Aura increases the damage of her ranged allies, and a timely Gust can silence groups of enemies at pivotal moments. Drow Ranger is fairly fragile with no real escape ability, causing her to struggle against faster and more aggressive melee heroes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High single target damage.<br/>Powerful early pusher.<br/>Good chaser.<br/>Buffs other ranged heroes.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Highly stat dependent.<br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Fragile and easily ganked.<br/>Slow attack animation.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Drow Ranger is usually played in the safe lane, with a support.<br/>Drow Ranger is easily ganked. Make sure not to overextend if your support is not nearby.<br/> Drow Ranger is all about positioning, since her Marksmanship bonus is disabled if an enemy closes to within 400 range. 
<br/>Stay behind your teammates and use them as a buffer. Reposition throughout fights to keep your tankier teammates between you and the enemy.<br/>Approach fights from the edges, and rely on the slow from Frost Arrows instead of physical proximity to keep enemies in range.<br/>Any item that helps Drow Ranger keep her distance is good, such as Dragon Lance, Shadow Blade, Blink Dagger and Force Staff.<br/>Like other ranged heroes, stutter stepping is useful for Drow Ranger, but not as important due to the slow from Frost Arrows.<br/>Because of her passive abilities, Drow Ranger is slightly less dependent on items than other carries, but can still be shut down in the early game. Be careful not to take any needless risks.<br/>Drow Ranger deals high damage to buildings, and should always capitalize on any opportunity to take down a tower.<br/>Due to her slow attack animation, Drow Ranger should not do anything except farm until at least level six, when her first point in Marksmanship will make her attack much faster.<br/>If you are having trouble timing last hits, try moving closer to the creep wave.<br/>Animation cancelling with the Stop hotkey (S by default) can also help with timing.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ember Spirit is a very mobile and evasive carry due to his ability to strike from range or dodge enemy attacks using Sleight of Fist and Fire Remnants. Playing Ember Spirit requires quick reflexes, good judgment and an aggressive mindset, as his instant cast animations and high mobility allow skilled players to outplay and outwit opponents, darting around the map to be where they least expect.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great mobility, hard to kill in teamfights.<br/>Global-wide presence, Strong pushing skillset.<br/>Deals AOE physical damage that scales into late game.<br/>Large magical damage in early to mid game.<br/>Absorbs moderate amount of magical damage.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low agility growth.<br/>Weak manfight capability.<br/>Vulnerable to silences and chain stuns.<br/>High requirement for good positioning and reflexes.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>The only benefit of leveling up Fire Remnant is its damage; The number and duration of remnants remains the same. It is viable to level Fire Remnant sooner for more burst damage in incoming teamfight.<br/>When laning against certain heroes (in mid) that rely on skill to harass ( Queen of Pain's Shadow Strike, Shadow Fiend's Shadowraze (Far), Windranger's Powershot), one point in Sleight of Fist might be valuable to dodge their damage. Note that Sleight of Fist dodge skills by rendering Ember Spirit invulnerable rather than disjointing them. As an example, Sleight of Fist should be used just before Shadow Strike hits you, not immediately after the skill being used.<br/>Sleight of Fist doesn't help Ember Spirit farm at all in early to mid game when he has few attack damage items. Flame Guard and Searing Chains help a lot to deal damage, and Fire Remnant helps Ember Spirit move around the map quickly and farm dangerous lanes.<br/>Ember Spirit has mana issues early in the game - using Fire Remnant to chase will often put you in danger. The higher level of Sleight of Fist you get, the further your Searing Chains can hold the enemy.<br/><h3>General</h3><br/>While Xin is an agility hero, Ember Spirit has very low armor and poor agility growth, making him vulnerable to physical damage despite his respectable strength growth. As such, he depends on using his spells and mobility to dodge attacks, disjoint projectiles and evade counterattack. His dependency on casting also makes him vulnerable to disables, particularly stuns and silences, as they prevent him from avoiding damage that his small HP pool is ill-suited to deal with.<br/>In general, Ember Spirit is best played either as a core farmer in the safe lane, or as a mid. As a safe lane farmer, Ember Spirit can safely farm up the items he needs to become a late-game threat, and his mobility allows him to engage on the enemy off-laner unexpectedly and help disable them during ganks, or evade enemy ganks targeted on him. As a mid, getting fast levels early on allows him to gank side lanes and get kills with his mobility and disables, giving him a strong early-game presence and allowing him to snowball out of control.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Faceless Void is a hero who holds mastery over time. He dashes through the battlefield, rewinding damage with Time Walk, stuns enemies with Time Lock, and causes their abilities to recharge slower with Time Dilation. His signature ability, Chronosphere, creates a bubble in space-time, stopping everything caught within so he and his team can beat down the enemy without retribution. As a melee carry, Faceless Void requires a large amount of farm in order to deal decent damage, but can be devastatingly powerful once he has his items. Faceless Void can be played solo in the off-lane, or with a support in the safe lane.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Fulfills both carry and initiator roles.<br/>Low cooldown escape ability.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Item and farm dependent.<br/>No room for mistakes with his ultimate.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Time Lock average stats (hero)<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Gyrocopter is a ranged carry who specializes at dishing out physical and magical damage over a wide area. He presents an unorthodox pattern of carry in that he can deal a large amount of magical damage and crowd control much earlier than other carry heroes thanks to Call Down and Rocket Barrage. As game goes on, Flak Cannon adds up his physical damage output and maintains his threat to entire enemy team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Deals wide area damage.<br/>High early game damage compared to most carries.<br/>Fast farmer.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Relatively fragile.<br/>Shorter attack range than other ranged carries.<br/>No escape mechanisms.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>As an agility hero with moderate HP pool and no innate escape ability, Gyrocopter is somewhat squishy and relies on item to keep himself alive in fight. His magical damage advantage diminishes after enemy carry becomes magic immune, and as a ranged hero with short attack range he has little advantage in direct manfight with enemy carries if not with a gold gold advantage. Also, most of his damage could be evaded if not timed correctly.<br/>Surprisingly, Gyrocopter could play as a greedy roaming support. By leveling Rocket Barrage and Homing Missile, he can initiate a gank and take down heroes together with his teammates. After gaining advantage he can flash farm using his skills and transit into a semi-carry. Note that more utility items can be made other than traditional carry items here.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Juggernaut is a formidable swordsman capable of engaging and cutting down single enemies without much risk to himself. A medium carry, Juggernaut can support his teammates with Healing Ward, and escape dangerous situations with Blade Fury. In a one-on-one fight, Juggernaut's Omnislash is the most powerful single target ability in the game, usually killing his opponent if no other enemies are around to absorb the damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High single target damage.<br/>Strong mid game presence.<br/>Can play aggressively in lane.<br/>Farms quickly.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Weak against multiple targets.<br/>Falls off against hard carries in the late game.<br/>Somewhat fragile.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Juggernaut is usually played in the safe lane, with a support.<br/>Juggernaut can opt to go for a farming route, emphasizing his late game damage output. This requires an early Battle Fury.<br/>Juggernaut can also go for a higher single target damage/Omnislash route, building items like Aghanim's Scepter or Desolator.<br/>Juggernaut excels in the mid game, where he can pick off enemies easily with Omnislash. Try to gain a dominant footing during this time.<br/>In the late game, harder carries like Spectre or Anti-Mage will surpass Juggernaut.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lone Druid is an adaptive carry who controls a durable Spirit Bear to wreak havoc on the battlefield. With two separate item inventories, the pair acts like two complimentary heroes that can be played a number of ways: with Lone Druid providing buffs from the back while the Spirit Bear fights on the front lines, or with Lone Druid attacking from long range while the Spirit Bear scouts and split pushes. This arrangement allows the Lone Druid to stay on the fringes of conflict, thus risking his own life less than most other carries. However, if the Spirit Bear falls in battle, the Lone Druid himself becomes significantly less effective. Because of the micro-management needed to control the Spirit Bear, Lone Druid can be a daunting hero for newer players.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Faster pusher and building destroyer.<br/>Strong at early-mid game fights.<br/>Scales well into the late game.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Few realistic options for increasing Spirit Bear's durability.<br/>Requires a moderate amount of micro skill.<br/>Often highly dependent on his Spirit Bear.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Lone Druid is most dominant in the mid-game. Try to gain an advantage during this period.<br/>If a match goes late, Lone Druid should consider building more damage on his bear, making his bear as powerful as he is.<br/>Lone Druid can be played with very little micro, but in order to be of maximum effectiveness the bear must be controlled separately, almost as a second hero.<br/>Lone Druid can use his bear to pick up runes, you can send the bear to easily steal the enemy bounty rune while you stay in lane.<br/>The Spirit Bear can buy and deliver items and act as personal courier if you either cannot get to the shop yourself or it is too much of a risk to send a courier.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Luna is a highly offensive carry who can demolish buildings and clear the battlefield in very little time. Along with her flying Moon Glaives, Luna can call upon the goddess Selemene to cover the battlefield in an Eclipse, striking down large numbers of enemies at once. Being a purely offensive hero, Luna suffers from a lack of defensive abilities, and will struggle against carries that are geared towards one-on-one combat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Hits multiple targets at once.<br/>Fast pusher and farmer.<br/>Good night vision.<br/>High magical damage output during the early game.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/>No defense mechanisms.<br/>Short attack range.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Easily kited by high-mobility heroes.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Because Luna has no means of escaping ganks, she is usually played in the safe lane, with a support. Her Lunar Blessing increases support's right click damage, making lane harassment easier.<br/> Luna can be played in a solo lane, but this is risky due to her fragility and short attack range.
<br/>Solo Luna is usually done to give her a level advantage early on, because Luna can snowball off of an early team fight with Eclipse and catch-up in farm very quickly with Moon Glaives, especially if she managed to stack a couple of jungle camps.<br/>A very odd trait for a hard carry is that Luna gains significant killing power with a level advantage because of Lucent Beam, and by extension Eclipse.<br/> Luna is an extremely potent pusher, especially when attacking barracks, as her Moon Glaives will bounce between multiple buildings with each attack.
<br/>Because of this, Luna should be present as often as possible to take down towers with her team.<br/>Any source of lifesteal greatly boosts Luna's survivability in the late game.<br/>Creep stacking is very useful for Luna. Ask an ally to start stacking for you early on.<br/>Tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Medusa is a very hard carry who can easily turn teamfights around in her favor. Her Mana Shield makes her one of the tankiest carries in the game, but her extreme item dependence requires her to farm for much of the game before she can be effective in teamfights. Split Shot allows her to farm really fast in the jungle and deal considerable damage to multiple heroes in fights. However, her early game is filled with problems, such as having the lowest base HP in the game, very little mana, and slow movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very powerful in late game.<br/>Effective against multiple opponents.<br/>Great crowd control.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Slow movement speed<br/>Very fragile in early game.<br/>Extremely item dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Medusa has one of the lowest base health in the game, making her quite vulnerable in the early game.<br/>Medusa is arguably the hardest carry in the game, but also the most item dependent. Knowing how to farm well is the most important aspect of playing her.<br/>Early on, Medusa should just focus on farming and surviving. Once you get Mana Shield, you'll have a lot more survivability in lane, but always keep an eye on the minimap for incoming ganks and your health and mana pools to see how much damage the enemies are doing.<br/> In the late game, Mana Shield and Stone Gaze allows Medusa to withstand much more punishment than most carries. 
<br/>Enemy teams who cannot kill Medusa quickly enough will often lose the teamfight.<br/>Because of this, a well farmed late game Medusa can often turn a losing match around.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Meepo is one of the most unique heroes in all of Dota, with the ability to split into up to five bodies. While he requires intensive micro-management, once mastered Meepo is capable of farming, pushing and ganking (maybe all at once) more successfully than most other heroes in the game. Earthbind allows Meepo to trap an enemy for an extended period of time, as all of Meepo's clones share individual cooldowns on abilities. Poof allows his clones to teleport to other clones, including the original Meepo, while also doing considerable amounts of damage, especially when several Meepos use it at the same time.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Has up to 5 independent bodies.<br/>Very fast farmer.<br/>Sheer numbers overwhelms enemies.<br/>Can disable enemies repeatedly.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very vulnerable against area nuke abilities.<br/>Very micro-intensive.<br/>Very hard to play.<br/>Requires lots of farm to be effective.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>With his ultimate, Meepo is the fastest farmer in the game. Played correctly, Meepo should have a large level advantage compared all other players in the game.<br/>Meepo's clones have higher pitched voice responses compared to the original Meepo. Use this as an audio cue to determine which Meepo is selected.<br/>You can bind a shortcut to each Meepo by doing Ctrl + a number. Attach the number 2 to 5 to the clones and 1 for the main Meepo, the shortcut will be saved for every game. This allows you to control individual clones with greater ease.<br/>In order to play Meepo well, it is necessary to possess strong micromanagement skills, as well as a powerful sense of map awareness. As each individual clone must be managed and moved around the map, Meepo can potentially be present everywhere on the map and congregate to focus their power when needed. However, at the same time this means that the death of one clone will mean the death of them all, so it is necessary to keep them out of harm's way and to know where it is safe to place the clones.<br/>Keep in mind that despite his higher magic resistance, Meepo is very vulnerable to area disables that can disable multiple clones at a time, as well as area-of-effect spells that deal more damage to grouped up targets like the clones. As well, powerful single-target nukes and Pure damage can make Meepo easy prey against heroes that are able to single out a single clone and burst it down.<br/>Generally, Meepo is played as a mid hero due to his unique ultimate. By getting an early level 3, Meepo can use the clone to help with last-hitting, scout out runes, stack camps, look for ganks and relay back to base for regen by using Poof. The clone augments Meepo's lane presence, and can serve to provide extra nuking and disable power if a support rotates mid to help you gank.<br/>Meepo can also be played as a safe-lane carry, as his low base damage and dependence on levels and farm in order to be effective means that he must be protected by his team. The objective of a safe-lane Meepo is to get level 3 as early as possible, then shuttle the clone to stack and farm jungle camps or serve as a base relay when needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Mirana is a very well-rounded hero who can fill almost any role required by her team. Her array of spells gives her the ability to disable, nuke, push, escape and gank in any number of situations. The teamwide invisibility from her Moonlight Shadow is one of the best ganking tools in the game. Depending on the lineup, Mirana is capable of playing as a carry, semi-carry, roamer, support, and even has minor jungling capabilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very long range stun.<br/>Team invisibility.<br/>Good escape mechanism.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Does not excel at any one role.<br/>Requires good aim.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Because of her low base strength and mediocre strength growth, Mirana is quite frail unless she builds survivability items; instead, she focuses on leveraging Leap and Moonlight Shadow to give herself and her team mobility and strategic advantages over the enemy, which can transition into victorious ganks and teamfights. As well, her poor intelligence growth means that unless she is built as a support with mana items, she will often have to rely on teammates to provide her with mana via Arcane Boots or mana-replenishing abilities.<br/>Be mindful that with her pitiful base damage and slow missile speed, Mirana often has trouble last-hitting to get gold and experience in the laning stage. When played as a carry, purchasing starting items that boost Mirana's attack damage can greatly aid in last-hitting.<br/>One of carry Mirana's greatest strengths is that, as a ranged agility hero, her physical damage is able to scale well without relying on a Unique Attack Modifier. As such, she is able to build an attack modifier as she sees fit according to the situation.<br/>Mirana's spells can be difficult to use properly due to her long 0.5 second cast animation, almost twice as long as most other heroes. This is especially true for Sacred Arrow, as the cast animation, projectile travel speed and enemy movement must all be taken into account. Be sure to position accordingly and cast ahead of time in order to account for this.<br/>Because both of her escape abilities are spells that must be cast, Mirana is particularly vulnerable to silences that prevent her from casting Leap and Moonlight Shadow. As such, building an item that allows her to dispel debuffs from herself is crucial no matter what role she is played in.<br/> Mirana's item and skill build can change drastically depending on what role she plays and how much farm priority she is given. There is no one-size-fits-all build for Mirana, as she can change her skill and item build depending on the situation, and even alter it in the middle of matches.
<br/>In general, as a carry, Mirana focuses on increasing her survivability and building items to boost the power of her physical attacks, and using her spells to gank or help in setting up kills to further boost her gold gain. Due to her mediocre attribute growth, she focuses on ambushing and ganking enemies through hit-and-run attacks rather than taking their carry head-on. Mirana can be played as a carry in the safe lane, or as a semi-carry in the off-lane due to her ability to use Leap to escape enemy gank attempts.<br/>As an early-game roamer, Mirana focuses on using Sacred Arrow to set up First Blood for her team. Successful kills on important enemy heroes, particularly their mid-laner or solo off-laner, can greatly set them back and give Mirana's team a strong laning advantage, which can transition into a farm and experience advantage from the mid-game onward. If successful, Mirana herself can transition into building utility items for her team, and play a semi-carry role.<br/>When played as a support, Mirana initially focuses on building items to increase the size of her mana pool, and using her spells to add nuke damage and disable to teamfights. She then transitions into building support items that provide utility for her team, as well as performing the other normal support duties. Support Mirana generally babysits her safe lane carry, occasionally roaming to the mid-lane for kill attempts with Sacred Arrow.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Monkey King is a trickster hero who jumps from treetop to treetop, scouting out his opponents from above, waiting for the opportunity to crash down on them with Primal Spring. With his magic extending staff, he smashes distant foes with Boundless Strikes, each blow charging his weapon through Jingu Mastery. Prone to Mischief, the Monkey King disguises himself as trees and everyday objects, allowing him to ambush enemies, or deceive them for a quick getaway.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Tricky and elusive.<br/>Very mobile.<br/>Reliable damage.<br/>Long melee attack range.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Highly dependent on trees.<br/>Suffers long stun if he falls from a tree.<br/>Vulnerable to stuns.<br/>Requires consecutive hits to benefit from passive bonus.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Unlike most melee heroes, Monkey King has an attack range of 300, allowing him to attack other melee opponents without fear of retaliation.<br/>Take advantage of Monkey King's ability to hop from tree to tree to retreat into the treeline around the edges of the map whenever he is threatened.<br/>Due to Monkey King's ultimate being unaffected by attack speed and Boundless Strike relying solely on raw damage values, players would have go for raw damage and agility in order to maximise these skills. Take note not to forgo attack speed completely, as attack speed helps with Jingu Mastery and his basic attacks.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Morphling is a carry hero who switches between damage dealer and resilient survivor. With an Ethereal Blade, Morphling can deal extremely high burst damage, often taking out an enemy instantly. However, he suffers from item and level dependency, as well as a low mana pool and low movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Can easily switch between dealing a ton of damage or having a high HP pool.<br/>Can one shot most heroes in the game with Ethereal Blade.<br/>Has an escape ability with a huge range..<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Short attack range.<br/>Low mana.<br/>One of the slowest heroes in the game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Early on, go mid or have a support keep you safe in the safe lane while you farm.<br/>Focus on farming up items. Only go for kills if you know you can get it.<br/>Morphling functions better as a carry in teams with a strong front line. This allows him to remain in the fight with a high amount of agility and hence right click or Adaptive Strike damage, without feeling the pressure of being focused. Although he is good at soaking damage through Morph Strength and items such as Linken's Sphere and Eye of Skadi, he is much more useful as your team's primary source of consistent damage.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Naga Siren is a versatile hero who can appear to be a team's hard carry while actually being just a support. As a support, you can pin down an enemy with your bkb-piercing Ensnare, reduce his armor with Rip Tide and hit him without putting yourself in danger with Mirror Image. And you have a fearsome teamfight ultimate with your dreamy Song of the Siren which will put your enemies to sleep. As a carry however, you will use your images and Rip Tide to farm the jungle and push the lanes, and your Song as a get-out-of-jail-free card, eventually crushing the enemy's base under the ocean's pressure.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Role versatility.<br/>Good at split-pushing and wave cutting.<br/>Ultimate allows team to reset fights.<br/>Good carrier for Gem of True Sight.<br/>Low cooldown root that pierces spell immunity.<br/>Probably the fastest farmer in the game once you've acquired a Radiance.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Somewhat farm dependent even if played as a support.<br/>Extremely farm dependent if played as a carry.<br/>Easy to misuse ultimate with poor communication.<br/>Requires some basic micro-management skills.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>A very strong combination on Naga Siren is Linken's Sphere and Boots of Travel. This makes Naga an incredibly versatile pusher, and Linkens makes it nigh impossible to catch her off-guard while pushing, allowing for an easy Song of Siren escape. Another item worth mentioning is Radiance. Slithice's illusions carry the Radiance aura, allowing farming over large areas and greater combat presence.<br/>Naga Siren can push with impunity; Rip Tide can affect entire creep waves, Mirror Image's illusions can deal tremendous damage to towers, and Song of the Siren makes it very difficult for the enemy team to gank her even if overextended.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Nyx Assassin is a powerful roamer whose burst damage nukes allows him to quickly kill any lone heroes he encounters. While his spells provide relatively little teamfight contribution outside of Impale, his ability to kill the enemy one by one can put the enemy team at a disadvantage in terms of economy, creating opportunities for his team to take advantageous teamfights or outfarm the opposition. However, Nyx Assassin's abilities fall off in the late game, where he plays a more supporting role with his stuns.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High burst damage.<br/>Reflects damage.<br/>Can give a big space advantage to his team by ganking the enemy team in the early to mid game.<br/>High health regeneration.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Less effective in the late game.<br/>Low mana.<br/>More information needed.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Despite his mediocre attribute growth, Nyx Assassin is a deceptively durable hero, as he can take advantage of damage block items in-lane due to being a melee hero and possesses higher-than-average base HP regen. As well, his Spiked Carapace ability allows him to shrug off extremely powerful damage nukes that could kill other heroes.<br/>Because of his skill set, Nyx Assassin prioritizes in building items that increase the size of his mana pool and provide mana replenishment. His ability to roam autonomously and kill with his high burst alpha means that he can do more for his team if he does not have to return to base frequently to refill his HP and mana. As well, items that improve his mobility, nuking and disabling power will better allow him to find, chase down and kill important targets.<br/>Beware that while Nyx Assassin's spells have respectable cast ranges, his 0.4 second cast animation means that they can be telegraphed and anticipated by the enemy, allowing them to counter the spells. Surprise is key to getting off Nyx Assassin's spells, as the enemy may be able to otherwise avoid them.<br/> Nyx Assassin is best played as a roamer or a solo off-laner in order to maximize his effectiveness.
<br/>As an off-laner, Nyx Assassin can take advantage of his innately high base HP regen to survive enemy harassment, and has Spiked Carapace at his disposal to deflect enemy magic nukes back at their caster. By taking advantage of solo experience and possibly gold if he can manipulate creep equilibrium to favor him, Nyx Assassin can get an early level 6 to begin roaming and getting kills with Vendetta.<br/>As a roamer, Nyx Assassin focuses on taking advantage of his respectable base movement speed and the long cast range of Impale to set up kills for his team in their lanes. Getting important pick-offs during the laning stage can get him the gold and levels he needs to further roam in the mid-game, and can set back the enemy's level and item progression considerably, making them easier targets to kill.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Assassin is a carry renowned for her innate chance to deal massive critical damage, often killing enemies with a single swing. She specializes in hunting down vulnerable heroes, slowing them with a Stifling Dagger and leaping past defenses with Phantom Strike. Like other carries, Phantom Assassin needs a decent amount of gold and items to be effective. Because of her complete dependence on landing physical crits, she is susceptible to disables and must rely on a Black King Bar in most teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very high burst damage.<br/>Has natural evasion.<br/>Has a cheap, long-range slow with good damage.<br/>Fairly mobile.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Dependent on pseudo-random distribution.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Highly dependent on Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Be mindful that Phantom Assassin is largely a single-target damage hero with low disable potential, so she is unable to deal with multiple targets simultaneously. Target prioritization is key, as Phantom Assassin must precisely eliminate her foes one at a time and cannot afford to be kited.<br/> Despite possessing extremely low base intelligence and intelligence growth, Phantom Assassin has only two low-cost active abilities, so she rarely runs into mana problems and does not have to go out of her way to increase the size of her mana pool. As well, her small mana pool allows her to benefit disproportionately from burst mana regen, such as , allied  and , letting her focus on building items to increase her damage output and carry potential.
<br/>Beware that this can also be used against Phantom Assassin as well, as destroying her meager mana pool with abilities like Mana Break, EMP and Mana Drain can render her unable to cast her spells or use item active abilities in a teamfight. The same applies to abilities that manipulate her intelligence like Arcane Orb and Intelligence Steal, which also renders her extremely vulnerable to Sanity's Eclipse.<br/>Be mindful that since she relies on two passive abilities for survival and damage output, Phantom Assassin is very vulnerable to break-type abilities, particularly Silver Edge. Removing her ability to evade physical attacks, as well as deal crits, can render her impotent in fights.<br/>As with most other agility carries, Phantom Assassin is very weak against burst Magical and Pure damage. While she gains respectable amounts of armor through her high agility growth and can evade attacks through Blur, her mediocre strength results in a health pool that can be easily shredded by spells. This also includes items such as Blade Mail, which can allow enemies to turn Phantom Assassin's high physical damage output against her.<br/>All of the above make building spell immunity very important on Phantom Assassin. The ability to block mana-destroying abilities, block break debuffs, and ignore magic nukes allows Phantom Assassin to survive long enough to eliminate key enemies during engagements.<br/> As a hard carry, Phantom Assassin is limited in the ways that she can be laned.
<br/>In standard situations, Phantom Assassin is played as a safe lane carry who is safeguarded by at least one support. She spends the laning stage accumulating last-hits and surviving enemy harass, trying to farm the items she needs to begin operating independently. As she possesses a slow and nuke in Stifling Dagger and a chasing/escaping spell in Phantom Strike, Mortred is capable of assisting her lanemates in setting up and getting kills on the enemy off-laner, and can dodge ganks fairly reliably if given an opportunity to cast Phantom Strike.<br/>Depending on the lane opponent, Phantom Assassin can be played as a solo mid. While she lacks base damage and can be easy to harass when approaching for last-hits, Stifling Dagger allows her to safely get last-hits at range and harass the enemy constantly. Both Stifling Dagger and Phantom Strike can be used as disabling and initiating spells when allied supports rotate mid for ganks, and the solo experience and gold can allow Phantom Assassin to start being effective earlier on.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Lancer is an exceptional carry who outnumbers and overwhelms his targets with armies of illusions. With the ability to charge at his opponents, the Phantom Lancer is relatively mobile, and can disappear briefly from the battlefield to confuse or avoid his enemies. Indistinguishable from with his clones, enemies often have a hard time targeting the real Phantom Lancer during fights. However, the Phantom Lancer's illusions can be destroyed by area of effect abilities, rendering him less effective as a result.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Creates confusion with large numbers of illusions.<br/>Excellent disjoint and dispel mechanism with Doppelganger.<br/>Good chase potential with Phantom Rush.<br/>Fast, clean attack animation.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Dependent on illusions.<br/>Weak against AoE abilities.<br/>Low health.<br/>No burst damage.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>As with other illusion-dependent heroes, Phantom Lancer should build items that provide stats and passive buffs rather than raw damage or attack speed, because those stats and buffs are transferred to his illusions.<br/>  is the most important item for Phantom Lancer. In the early game, most of his damage against heroes will come from Diffusal Blade's mana burn. 
<br/>A hero with mana will take more damage from Phantom Lancer than one who is out of mana, meaning that Phantom Lancer starts off dealing more damage, and less once the target's mana is drained.<br/>Because of this, Phantom Lancer sometimes has difficulties finishing off tough, retreating enemies like Timbersaw when they are already out of mana.<br/>When fighting heroes with low mana like Sven, Phantom Lancer will do less damage overall because the target's small mana pool is quickly depleted.<br/>Phantom Lancer's illusion army will often overwhelm new to mid-level players, causing them to attack the wrong target and waste their abilities. However, this should not be your primary strategy, because more experienced players are usually able to discover the real Phantom Lancer by observing the amount of damage being dealt (most illusions take more damage), debuff status, as well as player movement patterns.<br/>With enough micromanagement, you can deceive enemies by controlling illusions independently, and moving in ways you might move Phantom Lancer himself.<br/>Moving illusions together in clumps usually tells enemies that they are illusions.<br/> During smaller teamfights, staying inside a big group of illusions can make it harder for enemies to find the real Phantom Lancer. 
<br/>However, this tactic can backfire if enemy nukers target the entire group with AoE abilities. Make sure no nukers are nearby before grouping up.<br/>Remember to move Phantom Lancer himself when manipulating his illusions. A good tactic for newer players is to issue a distant move command for Phantom Lancer, while moving his illusions to trick the pursuing enemies.<br/>Though attack speed is still important on Phantom Lancer, it is not needed as much due to his ability to create attacking illusions.<br/>Get teammates to use buffs and abilities on an illusion to confuse enemies, such as Shallow Grave. This tactic is highly situational.<br/> Illusions are counted as heroes in a target check, but they sometimes receive effects intended for units, letting the enemy tell them apart straight away. 
<br/>For example, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask will stun Phantom Lancer's illusions by 5 seconds, but only stun Phantom Lancer himself for 1 second.<br/>When choosing an item build, remember that not all passive item abilities are shared with illusions.<br/>Read the Illusions article for a full understanding of how illusions work.<br/>Phantom Lancer is a moderately good ganker, but still needs to farm items for the late game. Try to balance the two roles depending on what opportunities are present on the map.<br/>Phantom Lancer has no strong disables, instead relying on speed and slows to catch up to his opponents.<br/>Phantom Lancer is a decent split pusher, especially in the late game. Take advantage of this whenever you aren't fighting.<br/>Phantom Lancer excels in long, drawn-out fights, which give him lots of time to wear down his opponents' mana and spawn more illusions.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Razor is a fast, tough anti-carry who steals the attack power from his enemies, and transfers it to himself. Armed with a Desolator, he can quickly melt away armor with Eye of the Storm, allowing his team to cut through enemies with ease. However, Razor has no disables, and must rely on staying close to his targets and executing his abilities properly in order to be an effective damage dealer.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Counters carries.<br/>Strong lane presence.<br/>Good starting Strength and Agility.<br/>Fast movement speed.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Dependent on well-positioned abilities to deal damage.<br/>Loses effectiveness against heroes with higher mobility.<br/>Does not recover well from a bad early game.<br/>No disables.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Razor can be played in all lanes, but is most commonly played in mid. Because of his speed and durability, he is not extremely dependent on supports.<br/>Razor is surprisingly durable compared to many carries, especially in the early to mid game. This advantage falls off in the late game, however, making him a medium carry.<br/>Compared to other carries, Razor's autoattacks deal little damage. In order to hit hard, Razor relies on his Static Link to steal enemy damage, and Eye of the Storm to reduce their armor.<br/>Razor's abilities are dependent on positioning, requiring him to chase and remain close to his targets.<br/>Razor's ability effects and sounds cannot be seen or heard by the enemy when he is invisible, allowing him to deal damage surreptiously with a Shadow Blade or other means of invisibility.<br/>Razor's autoattacks have a small delay after its visual effect before the damage is dealt. Time your animations accordingly.<br/>Razor should be thought of as a hybrid between tankiness and damage, and his item build should reflect whichever his team needs more.<br/>With Unstable Current, Eye of the Storm, and a few defensive items, Razor should aim to dominate the battlefield by placing himself directly in the middle of the fight.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Riki's permanent invisibility is both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. On one hand, it makes him able to surprise enemies and farm with very little concern. On the other hand, without invisibility he has no real defense. He still has to watch out for revealing items such as Dust of Appearance and Gem of True Sight, as well as abilities that prevent him from going invisible. If he stays alive and picks off lone enemies, he can quickly get out of control.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Permanent invisibility.<br/>Can use items without breaking invisibility.<br/>Relatively mobile.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low health points.<br/>Low health regeneration<br/>Low mana.<br/>Low base damage<br/>Easily countered by wards and True Sight.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Riki is one of the best support and roamer in the game. The ability to place wards and sentry while invisible makes Riki a viable support hero and also scout area while permanently hidden makes Riki one of the best roamers in the game<br/>Due to recent 6.87 riki is not a viable carry hero in late game as he is out carried by almost all carries in the game. Riki has a carry and support potential thus Riki should be played as a Semi-support.<br/>Riki is exceptional at ganking lone heroes and picking them off one by one. He can snowball easily through just getting lots of kills even without farm. Try to get kills before the enemy starts grouping up, so they cannot punish you with detection items.<br/> Riki is an attribute-based carry, thanks to 's backstab damage. This means that it continues to get stronger and stronger as the game goes on, as long as you continue to farm, gank, and purchase the right items.
<br/>Because of this, Diffusal Blade should be your first core item completed, it gives everything Riki needs: the agility scales well with and the active Purge helps you in many applications, removing strong protections like Repel, Guardian Angel from enemies and purging them while inside of Smoke Screen, which is your main ganking combo. Always use all the charges before buying the recipe again and search to do the best use of them. Be warned however, Diffusal Blade no longer purges dust as it cannot be used on allies.<br/> Do not walk straight up to enemies and deep into enemy territory and expect never to die. If they have any kind of detection (e.g. ), then Riki dies very quickly.
<br/>As a result of this, make a habit of constantly checking the enemy's inventory for revealing items.<br/>Be wary around more durable enemy heroes. Spell Immunity from Black King Bar allows enemies to ignore Smoke Screen and fight Riki, ignoring his backstab damage.<br/>Riki is a key hero to catch slippery foes and heroes that are heavily reliant on their own active skills since he can approach without detection and use smoke to prevent them from using escape spells, so it is wise to pick him as a counter pick to many heroes like Slark, Juggernaut, Anti-Mage, Weaver or Storm Spirit. However, be careful of enemies carrying escape items, like Force Staff, Glimmer Cape, Blink Dagger or Shadow Blade/ Silver Edge.<br/>Always scout the enemy jungle once in a while, you may encounter some enemy farming alone for an easy kill, also help high mobility heroes like Spirit Breaker or Nature's Prophet to set up a gank.<br/>Do not be afraid of enemies carrying Gem of True Sight, track down their movement and wait, sooner or later they are going to end up alone and when this happens do not hesitate, use the fog of war and approach them from the sides, go for the kill and recover the Gem.<br/>Riki requires a lot of map knowledge as some supports or players place sentry wards in obvious position. Knowing heroes who carry dust, knowing the range of the sentry detection and knowing hot spots for sentry placement can increase your overall survivability in the game<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Fiend is a ranged carry who collects the soul of every unit he kills, growing stronger with each soul claimed. Because of this, he benefits from a high attack damage potential, but also suffer punishing setbacks if he dies. The Shadow Fiend can also unleash all the souls he has gathered, devastating enemies over a wide area with Requiem of Souls. While highly effective as an offensive hero, Shadow Fiend has no defensive abilities and needs help from teammates to position his abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Gains damage from kills.<br/>Fast farmer.<br/>Good balance of early game magic damage and late game physical damage.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Loses damage upon dying.<br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Requires good positioning.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Shadow Fiend is nearly always played in the mid lane.<br/>Unlike other carries, Shadow Fiend's heavy damage depends on his Necromastery count. This means that dying will make him significantly weaker, especially in the late game.<br/>Shadow Fiend has no movement or escape abilities, making him easily gankable. Make sure there are wards to spot any potential gankers moving to the mid lane.<br/> Survivability is essential for Shadow Fiend early in the game. 
<br/>A Shadow Fiend with few souls will have a hard time regaining footing in the mid game.<br/>Play conservatively and take few risks until he has a decent health pool and soul count.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Slark is an extremely slipperly melee carry. Jumping over obstacles, he Pounces on enemies and jumps away to safety, shrouding himself from damage with Shadow Dance. When unseen, Slark's natural regeneration replenishes his health, allowing him to return to the fight time and time again. Slark is susceptible to area disables and magical nukes, and his damage is mostly effective against single targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Numerous escape mechanisms.<br/>Steals enemy attributes.<br/>Large night vision.<br/>Strong pick-off and snowball potential.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Fragile in the early game.<br/>Low attribute growth.<br/>Primarily single target focused.<br/>Has no stuns.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Slark is usually played in the safe lane, with a support. He can also be played in the offlane.<br/>Slark is sometimes played in the mid lane, but may struggle against ranged heroes like Queen of Pain.<br/>Slark's base attributes are average at best, although with enough stolen Agility and damage items he can keep up with hard carries such as Phantom Assassin and Sniper.<br/>Slark is potent ganker in the mid game, and should always be looking for opportunities to pick off an enemy. The enemy jungle is an excellent hunting ground for Slark.<br/>Slark's unusually large night vision radius (1800) means he can see further than most heroes at night. Use this advantage when timing ganks.<br/>Because Slark lacks a stun, enemies will often blink or teleport away when ganked.<br/>Slark differs from most carries in that he takes more of a hit-and-run approach.<br/>Due to the high health regeneration from Shadow Dance, Slark can often return to teamfights after moving out of enemy vision to regain health.<br/>Slark's mana is fairly low in the early game, when his abilities should be used sparingly.<br/>Slark should try to play aggressively once he reaches level six, so he can take full advantage of the agility transfer from Essence Shift.<br/>Use Slark's high mobility and pick off supports before fights break out, allowing his team to start with an advantage.<br/>Slark can stack 2 or even up to 3 camps at a time using his high mobility and pounce.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sniper is a very long ranged carry, designed to decimate enemies from the backline. He is able to scout ahead with his Shrapnel, and pick off targets from extreme distances with Assassinate. In the late game, a well-farmed Sniper can destroy almost any enemy before they have a chance to get close or do much in a teamfight. However, Sniper is also one of the most defenseless heroes in the game, and can be easily killed if caught alone.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very high attack range.<br/>High single target damage.<br/>Excellent harassment abilities.<br/>Easy for beginners.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Low mobility.<br/>Fragile and easily ganked.<br/>Requires a good early game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Stutter stepping between attack animations allows Sniper to land more hits on a moving target.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Spectre is a hard carry who can dominate the late game if she gets the necessary farm. Her Desolate ability lets her take on solo opponents with the upper hand, and Dispersion makes her a tanky foe who deals damage by reflecting incoming attacks. However, her early game is one of the worst in the game, being squishy and her only escape using up a lot of her mana pool. Get past this, however, and Spectre will be a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Global map presence.<br/>Extremely strong late game.<br/>Can gank well early game.<br/>Fairly tanky carry.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low early game health and mana.<br/>Farms really slow without Radiance.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Low agility gain for an agility hero.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Spectre has a terrible early game, and it's likely that enemies will try to take advantage of this. Make sure you always have enough mana for Spectral Dagger while laning so you can escape from enemies who are trying to kill you.<br/>Spectre has a weak lane presence. Picking her requires a team that will largely be able to support her in the laning phase.<br/>One of Spectre's biggest strengths as a carry is her ability to participate in teamfights and ganks instantly through Haunt without wasting valuable farming time.<br/>Spectre's main focus should be getting Radiance, which makes her significantly more powerful, both at fighting at farming.<br/>Using Manta Style to farm is a common tactic, allowing Spectre to farm areas of the map in which she would be in risk of a gank. Combined with Radiance, Spectre can be a rather effective split pusher.<br/>In late game teamfights, Haunt and Desolate will allow your illusions to wither down support heroes at the back at significant speeds. In addition, you should always be in the middle of team fights to maximize the damage reflection of Dispersion.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Templar Assassin is a highly elusive and devastating hero in the right hands. Her Refraction simultaneously protects her from any damage instance, no matter how low or high, and increases her attack damage output for a few attacks. Combined with the armor reduction of Meld, any enemy hero with small health pools should be wary of her, as if they are not vigilant, they will be crippled by her Psionic Traps, letting her catch up, or materialize herself beside them with the help of a Blink Dagger, then finish them off in only a few swings of her Psi Blades. With proper timing and the right tools, Lanaya can protect herself from powerful nukes, evade the enemy team, and even have the potential to wipe out an entire team with perfect positioning and quick actions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Capable of shredding armor and dealing massive amounts of physical damage.<br/>Can be very elusive.<br/>Provides some free vision for team.<br/>Can efficiently farm Ancient stacks.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very vulnerable to damage over time abilities.<br/>Meld by itself is not a reliable escape mechanism.<br/>Rather dependent on good positioning to make most use of Psi Blades' spill AoE.<h2>Tips</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Templar Assassin is almost always played in the mid lane.<br/>While Templar Assassin is a situational pick, when drafted properly she can spiral out of control and enter a state of near invulnerability. This allows an experienced player halt the opposing side at the start of the midgame, preventing the match from ever reaching the late game.<br/>Templar Assassin requires an aggressive play style in order to be effective.<br/>Templar Assassin reaches her damage peak at around level 11, earlier than most carries, through the use of Refraction and Meld.<br/>Due to her early damage peak, snowballing is crucial to TA being successful. You'll want to have both your Blink Dagger and Desolator as early as possible, ideally no later than 20 minutes.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Terrorblade is a potent carry who demolishes buildings and heroes alike with his illusions. With Metamorphosis, he transforms into an imposing demon avatar, gaining the ability to deal high damage at range. However, Terrorblade's low natural health makes him quite fragile in the early game, and his reach is rather limited without Metamorphosis.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very high damage during Metamorphosis.<br/>Good pusher.<br/>High base armor<br/>Fast farmer<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very low starting health.<br/>Highly cooldown dependent<br/>Low mobility.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Terrorblade is fairly item dependent, and needs to be able to farm well.<br/> Terrorblade's item builds are versatile, and can range from an early/mid-game oriented build such as , , and , to a more conservative late game build such as a / rush into  (similar to how you can itemize  or ).
<br/>Build items this way to make his illusions stronger and to tank more magical damage since he has natural high armor to soak physical damage.<br/>Even though he is usually built in a more or less stable item progression, newly added items can benefit him greatly through early/mid game.<br/>Dragon Lance is the best gold-to-stat ratio item currently in-game and increases his range in Metamorphosis by a considerable amount, making sieges much safer and positional options more open, as well as the items natural progression into a Hurricane Pike which increases Terrorblades mobility and adds a higher damage output or a means of escape.<br/>Second best stat-to-gold ratio item is Diffusal Blade, and Terrorblade along with his illusions can really abuse the item. All of his illusions will apply the Mana Burn and the active ability Purge is his best friend against his own bane, SILENCE, whilst the slow can be pretty useful to maintain the enemy position in a place where you can bombard them from afar.<br/>Echo Sabre is not to be overlooked either. Terrorblade has a relatively low mana pool and a low intelligence gain, but his naturally high agility makes him a hard hitter that likes to "man up" on heroes that rely on basic attack damage. Echo Sabre double strike ability and its applied slow significantly increase damage output, while the stats boost illusion max HP pool and offer Terrorblade a way to recover mana when out of base.<br/>Armlet of Mordiggian doesn't appear as a fitting item for Terrorblade on first glance, but its insane armor increase (and Terrorblades naturally high armor), together with its active makes it a strategically useful item for a split pushing/ganking type of play. Activating Unholy Strength before summoning illusions (be it from his own ability or a Manta Style) and immediately turning it off, gives your illusions a big increase in max HP, making them viable for pushing without the creep wave. The health drain of Armlet can be abused when coupled with a " Shadow Blade/ Blink Dagger/Really good sense of positioning" to purposely drain HP and execute a Sunder gank (very effective with a Legion Commander, for example).<br/>Terrorblade excels at split pushing in the mid and late game, where he can summon up to four Metamorphosed illusions with a Manta Style.<br/>Sunder allows Terrorblade to dominate any one-versus-one fights with heroes that can't disable or prevent you from casting it.<br/> While laning, use your illusions to stack the jungle for yourself. Then once the laning stage breaks down, you can use Metamorphosis to clear jungle stacks, thereby increasing your GPM.
<br/>When appropriate, farm the jungle with the main Terrorblade while micro-ing Terrorblade illusions to farm in lane to boost your GPM.<br/>To master the laning phase, make sure to use illusions as a means to draw creep aggro (keeping yourself safely behind) when your tower is under siege, effectively dragging them to a safer place to farm, while considerably lessening damage done to the tower.<br/>His illusions offer a great deal of scouting potential, as they're long lasting. If summoned at appropriate locations (usually runespots, either in river or safely on your own highground), his illusions can easily creep-cut and bring the creepwave into the jungle, making split-pushing much easier and effective.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Troll Warlord is one of the strongest hard carries in the whole game. His signature ability, Berserker's Rage, allows him to switch between melee and ranged autoattacks, both with their pros and cons. He is most devastating in a one vs. one situation because of his ability Fervor but he also can put out major damage in teamfights with Whirling Axes either slowing the enemy or making them miss. Finally, his ultimate Battle Trance gives the hero and his team increased attack speed, useful for taking objectives such as Roshan or enemy buildings.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very fast attack speed<br/>One of the best 1v1 heroes in the game<br/>Melee and ranged forms<br/>Global, multipurposed ultimate<br/>Can chainstun the enemy by bashing<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Item dependent<br/>No escape mechanism<br/>Extremely vulnerable to disables<br/>Depends on lifesteal and bashes for survivability<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>At level 25 without items and with 7 stacks of fervor and his ultimate Troll Warlord reaches 597/600 attack speed.<br/>Troll Warlord is faster in melee mode, making it easier to chase or escape from enemies. It also increases your armor, so switching to melee form whenever damage is received reduces the overall damage you take.<br/>You can opt for the strategy to kill Roshan early. Troll Warlord with HotD and Phase boots can easily kill Roshan thanks to his bash and high attack speed against single targets. In addition the use of a smoke may allow a sneaky Rosh.<br/>When your target enemy is starting to become harder to chase in melee form, keep in mind that you still have a Ranged form. Ranged Whirling Axes can aid in crippling them, so that you can revert back to melee form to finish them off.<br/> Augment Troll Warlord's power with damage-boosting items, since his power lies in his excellent attack speed.
<br/>Ally buffs such as Magnus's Empower can also be a good source of boosting damage.<br/>Because of its scaling boost to attack speed Fervor is usually leveled up last with 1 point at level 4 for tower pushing/Roshan/beating on a single hero. Having your move speed and bash duration higher will greatly benefit your survivability and chase, since Fervor is extremely good with even only 1 skill point. But keep in mind that since a recent update the first stack is always active.<br/>It's better to focus on one target rather than switching from one to another, since Fervor makes him more dangerous the more he attacks the same target with each blow.<br/> Attack speed items such as  and  allow you to build up Fervor more quickly, but do not scale well if you opt to max it early on.
<br/>If you're 6-slotted, sell any attack speed items for higher damage items. With all skills levelled, Troll Warlord easily achieves his maximum attack speed, so items like Mjollnir are much less useful.<br/>Drum of Endurance and Sange and Yasha are strong items coupled with the bonuses from Berserker's Rage, giving you even greater mobility to prevent kiting.<br/> , ,  and  are the only few Unique Attack Modifiers that stack with the commonly opted .
<br/>Maelstrom is an excellent source of early-game and mid-game damage, but upgrading to a Mjollnir is discouraged as Troll Warlord hardly benefits from the 80 attack speed it provides. Instead of upgrading your Maelstrom, sell it for higher damage items such as Daedalus, or Monkey King Bar, or utility items such as Eye of Skadi, Black King Bar or Heaven's Halberd.<br/> Heroes who mainly auto-attack benefit greatly from . Try to draft at least one more hard hitting carry for your team to get the most out of it. If your team insists on picking four carries, Battle Trance can often be the saving grace for a horribly gold starved team as it equates to more than a free five second Hyperstone for everyone at its first level. Contently look at the map and use Battle Trance at any engagement of allies to give them an advantage. Check at the map at use your ultimate every time someone is fighting or pushing. Communicate with your team to know when exactly you need to activate your ultimate. Be sure to always have enough mana, buy a  or an  to get more mana regen.
<br/>Battle Trance can be used to help allies in many ways even if you are not there, as the effects are global, that is why Troll is often played mid to reach level 6 quickly (and do a fast Roshan at the same time). Whether you have someone pushing a tower such as Nature's Prophet or Lycan, if Faceless Void has used Chronosphere, Legion Commander her Duel or if Ursa is Roshing, heroes with high base damage but low attack speed like Tiny, be sure to help your friends by using your Ultimate!<br/>Battle Trance does not buff Illusions, but it does work on Meepo and his clones allowing to reach the highest DPS of the game. Because Meepo is excellent at pouncing on enemies, he can generally obliterate anyone instantly once he blink/poofs in under the effects of Battle Trance. He can use Troll's ultimate to destroy buildings in backdoor.<br/><h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ursa is a simple carry/anti-tank hero who specialises in quickly taking out enemies one at a time. He is powerful from start to finish, tearing apart enemies and getting early Roshan kills for his team with the help of his passive Fury Swipes. Combined with Overpower and Enrage, Ursa can quickly take down even the toughest heroes. However, his damage output is strictly limited to melee range and he has no mobility options, making him a prime target for enemy disables and thus heavily reliant on items such as Black King Bar and Blink Dagger.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Best solo Roshan killer in the game.<br/>Very high single target damage.<br/>Efficient early/mid game jungler.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<br/>Low mobility.<br/>No disables.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Ursa's lack of ranged abilities and mobility options make him very easy to kite. Pair up with a disabler such as Lion or Shadow Shaman.<br/>Ursa's Fury Swipes ability allows him to solo-kill Roshan at very low levels with any source of lifesteal (as low as level 1 if paired with Wraith King). However, doing so makes him vulnerable to ganks by a savvy enemy team. Consider informing your team to de-ward the area around the Roshan pit regularly and using Smoke of Deceit to sneak in.<br/>Ursa can be easily shut down by disables.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Vengeful Spirit is a very strong and well-balanced support who specializes in roaming, ganking and disabling. Unlike most other casting supports, her skill set emphasizes physical damage over magical, allowing her abilities to be useful in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Not Item dependent<br/>Abilities useful at all stages of the game<br/>Has Nukes and Disables<br/>High combat stat gains<br/>Has very good debuffs<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Can be ganked very easily<br/>Limited mana pool<br/>Low attack range<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Because of her combination of disables and debuffs, Vengeful Spirit is an excellent roaming partner, as she can reliably stun an enemy and reduce their armor, setting them up for being finished off by teammates. Her lack of meaningful damage output and more than one disable means that she must rely on her teammates to land follow-up stuns and kill the target, however.<br/>Unlike most casting-focused supports, Vengeful Spirit benefits from an innately high strength and agility growth, giving her plenty of HP and armor. This means that, despite her sacrificial nature, she is very resilient against all types of damage, and under unusual circumstances can transition into playing as a semi-carry.<br/>Vengeful Spirit is a very item-independent hero, and can greatly contribute to fights and ganks even with only a few basic items. Combined with her strong ganking prowess, she should focus on constantly roaming and engaging the enemy, singling out key targets for elimination to buy time and space for her team.<br/>Due to her skill set, Vengeful Spirit benefits from building support utility items that grant her team an advantage in fights. Her ability to displace heroes with Nether Swap means that she benefits greatly from building mobility items that help her initiate, and her low base intelligence ensures that she must purchase mana items to allow her to cast her spells more regularly.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Venomancer is a support hero who can deal tremendous damage over time with his spells. He also possesses strong push and counter-push potential in his Plague Wards, allowing him to defend towers and high-ground as well as take enemy towers by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Can deal tremendous amounts of damage when his spells are combined.<br/>Strong slows and DOTs make him great for early ganks<br/>Wards provide lots of utility like free vision, push/counterpush, and a basic ability to jungle<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>No hard disables<br/>Generally poor survivability<br/>Has mana problems early and mid game<br/>Large portions of his damage can be removed with items like Pipe of Insight or Black King Bar<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>While his spells possess a large amount of raw nuking power, Venomancer lacks immediate killing power, and does not have any hard disables. Always attempt to kill enemies with the aid of teammates, as they can stun the enemy and finish them off in situations where the foe may otherwise easily escape.<br/>In general, Venomancer should be played as a pushing support who provides utility to his team, rather than as a fighter, due to his general frailty and low movement speed. As such, many of the more expensive recommended luxury items that focus on physical damage output should not be built at all, as they provide little comparative benefit and do not synergize well with Venomancer's skills. Instead, focus on building mobility and utility items that help your team without requiring you to jump into the fray outside of casting your spells.<br/>As an agility caster, Venomancer suffers from severe mana problems. It is recommended to focus on increasing the size of your mana pool and purchasing mana regen items when possible. Due to the high mana cost of Poison Nova, you need to carefully manage your mana so that you can cast it in a teamfight.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Viper is medium carry whose potent Nethertoxin grow more potent as his target's health diminishes. His Corrosive Skin poisons any who dares attack him, while his Poison Attack and Viper Strike slows any enemy to a crawl. Because of this, Viper is an exceedingly deadly ganker during the early game, but is less potent during the late game. Viper also lacks any disables, and struggles against enemies with spell immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Powerful slow makes him a great ganker in the early stage.<br/>Fairly durable.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Has mana issues during the early and mid game.<br/>No real disable.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Poison Attack and Viper Strike slow attack speed as well, apply them to the enemy carry to cripple their damage output.<br/>Viper is great at kiting melee carries with his large variety of slows and with an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Weaver is a slippery carry who shifts in and out of space, and turns back time to recover from his injuries. Summoning The Swarm to latch onto his enemies, Weaver can drastically reduce enemy in teamfights. Weaver is extremely item dependent, and must farm well throughout the game to be effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Elusive and hard to pin down.<br/>Reduces enemy armor.<br/>Good lane pusher.<br/>Highest base damage for ranged heroes.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Countered by true sight.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/>Low attribute growth coupled with the lowest base stats.<br/>Very item dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Weaver is very item dependent, but is very hard to stop once he gets a Linken's Sphere.<br/>Weaver is one of the most difficult heroes to lock down, but this elusiveness can be countered by disables, true sight, and silence.<br/>Weaver is great at kiting and killing melee carries (such as Ursa) with the low cooldown of Shukuchi and the armor reduction effects of The Swarm.<br/>Though treated as hard carry, Weaver is one of the most difficult heroes to lane against because of Geminate Attack granting him the ability to hit an enemy twice in a single attack instance, effectively multiplying his damage output by two every few seconds.<br/> Weaver usually goes for . The active on  (the phase and the bonus ms) is kind of lost on Weaver since Shukuchi gives both of them already, but you can use it while Shukuchi is on cooldown. The +24 damage however is very nice, especially combined with Geminate Attack which makes it +48, a  for half the price. Also there are plenty of times where you won't be attacking that often in a fight, making the attack speed from treads somewhat irrelevant.
<br/>Alternatively, consider relying solely on Shukuchi for movement speed and skip boots entirely, focusing on more important items like Linken's Sphere and Dragon Lance for carry Weaver or Aghanim's Scepter for support Weaver.<br/>Weaver starts off with 15 strength for a total of 500 HP and poor armor. Don't hestitate to leave your fountain with a couple of Iron Branches or Circlets that you can upgrade into a Magic Wand or a Wraith Band. The only upside to having such a poor health pool is that flat HP regen is proportionally better on Weaver than on anyone else. An Enchanted Mango or a Ring of Regen (that will later upgrade into Drum of Endurance for example) will go a long way to keeping Weaver healthy.<br/>Bottle is a very interesting choice on Weaver. Its flat HP regen does wonders on Weaver's poor health pool and the mana will help you to spam Shukuchi. You may not want to contest for runes considering how fragile you are (though you could try to swipe one under the enemy's nose with Shukuchi). Once you reach level 6, you can always use a Town Portal Scroll to regenerate in your fountain, fill your bottle, and go right back to lane with your Time Lapse.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ancient Apparition is a spellcaster hero whose abilities can empower, disable and destroys with the power of ice. His ultimate, Ice Blast allows him to damage & froze his foes HP regeneration, placing them on disadvantages during every teamfight thus making him scales very well into late game. However, Kaldr is not a beginner friendly support as his skillset require precise timing and judgement to execute. He also quite fragile as he does not really possesses any reliable/instant escape and disables mechanisms.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Strong team fight ultimate.<br/>Long range scouting spells.<br/>(The only) hard counter to healing heroes.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very squishy and sluggish.<br/>Require good precision & judgement to make use of his skills (especially his ultimate).<br/>Harassment and zoning ability is rather poor.<br/>Very level dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Ancient Apparition's spells, although spammable, are very mana-expensive. Be mindful of your mana consumption.<br/>Any heroes that possess reliable stun/slows such as Wraith King/Lion/Shadow Demon etc. synergize very well with Kaldr's Cold Feet and Ice Vortex; results in extensive magical damage & disables duration.<br/>Compare to other supports alike, Ancient Apparition was very level dependent in order to scale; thus making him a legit Hand of Midas holder.<br/>Kaldr's abilities require a certain amount of skill and teamwork to make the best out of him; although primarily played as a lane support hero, a good early game allows AA to snowball and possessing a Aghanim's Scepter allows him to scale extremely well into late game.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bane is a very powerful single-target disabler who possesses reasonable nuking power. His strongest suit is setting up kills for teammates with high damage output or unreliable stuns, making him a powerful roamer and ganker who can assist teammates in getting kills throughout a match. This can allow him to regularly obtain reliable gold through kills and assists, which in turn allows him to build items to suit his needs.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Powerful single-target disabler.<br/>Excellent starting stats, good at trading hits in the laning stage.<br/>Excellent damage.<br/>Great laning phase and ganking abilities, seeing that Nightmare can be used is many ways, be it to save or to set up combos and ganks.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Zero AoE capabilities, poor against early pushing line ups.<br/>Suffers with mana problems early game.<br/>Zero Mobility.<br/>Ultimate requires channeling.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>While he possesses strong disables, Bane suffers from a poor mana pool and no escape spells, meaning that he can run out of mana quite often while casting his high-cost low-cooldown spells, and can be easily killed if caught out of position. As such, Bane should focus on building items to increase the size of his mana pool and give himself mana regen, as well as mobility items to give him initiation and escape ability.<br/>Keep in mind, all of Bane's spells are single-target, which makes him quite easy to be countered by items such as Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb. As well, his single-target nature means that he is unable to disable more than two enemies in an engagement unless additional disables can be obtained through farming items. Be sure to factor this into each game, as the enemy team's lineup as well as that of your own can vary, and as a result drastically affect Bane's effectiveness in that match.<br/>Bane can be played effectively as a side lane support due to his combination of disabling and nuking power. Nightmare can be used to set up kills against lane opponents or hinder them from pursuing in the event of rotations and ganks from either side, while Enfeeble provides a safe way to harass the enemy and prevent them from getting last-hits. As well, Brain Sap can be a strong damage nuke to cast in the event of ganking targets as it deals Pure damage to the enemy while also healing Bane.<br/>Bane's high base movement speed and disabling potential also allows him to be played as a roamer, especially if combined with a teammate with an unreliable but strong disable. His movement speed allows him to quickly get within range to cast Nightmare on a gank target, holding them in position for up to four seconds and making them easy targets for a follow-up disable.<br/>Beware that while Bane is a strong disabler, he is also quite frail and easy to kill if focused by the enemy; as such, he is not a very strong first initiator in teamfights, but can be a strong second-wave disabler who casts his disables once the enemy's attention is not focused on him. As well, he has a very long cast animation on his spells (0.5 seconds on most spells, compared to the standard 0.3 seconds on most heroes), so it is necessary to plan ahead when casting spells.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Batrider is a Intelligence hero great at ganking, most focused on disrupting the enemy team's positioning and isolating enemies. His Flaming Lasso can be used to single out certain heroes, along with using his Sticky Napalm to increase the damage his enemies take. His Firefly allows him to move over terrain, opening numerous possibilities for him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>One of the best slows in-game<br/>Good ganker<br/>Strong early game presence<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low Attack Range<br/>Low Movement Speed<br/>Item Dependency<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Batrider can effectively jungle early with a few points put into Firefly and Sticky Napalm. Make sure to stack the camps to maximize income!<br/>Make sure you have a Blink Dagger and a Smoke of Deceit when you gank with Flaming Lasso. Most enemies will not know what hit them.<br/>Remember that Batrider has only 1200 day vision while most other heroes have 1800, keep this in mind when ganking.<br/>During the mid-game, remember to go for ganks with smoke, often times only one other hero is needed to secure kills.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Chen is a support who is one of the strongest junglers in the game, and can use his persuaded creeps (thanks to Holy Persuasion) to gank and push very early in a game. Chen is able to weaken his adversaries with his Penitence, and can heal all allies and neutral creeps under his control with Hand of God. His reliance on micromanagement and map awareness makes him a difficult hero to master, but utilized properly Chen has the ability to gain a powerful early advantage for his team, which can allow them to decisively end matches quickly.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Natural jungler.<br/>Global Heal.<br/>Most effective pusher in early stage of the game.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very micro-intensive<br/>Very hard to play<br/>If not played properly will make enemies gain significant gold advantages.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>While Chen is a force to be reckoned with in the early game, he loses much of his potency in the late game. Because Chen depends on the strength of his creeps to overpower enemy heroes and push down towers in the early game, his greatest weakness is to allow the enemy to get enough farm and levels to easily deal with his creeps, rendering them useless. As such, Chen must attempt to gain a powerful early lead for his team, and try to crush the enemy before they become strong enough to simply farm his creeps and turn them into a liability.<br/>Chen is usually played as a jungler, as Holy Persuasion allows him to convert a neutral creep to do his bidding. The creep can be used to farm other neutral camps, using its auto-attacks and abilities to kill other neutrals while tanking their attacks to keep Chen safe. As well, the neutral creep can use its active ability to assist Chen in ganking the enemy, on top of adding its attacks to deal more damage to the gank target.<br/>Using Holy Persuasion on an enemy creep in conjunction with the teleport part of Test of Faith it is possible to send an enemy hero teleporting to that creep into your fountain.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Crystal Maiden is an efficient support who specializes in slowing enemies. Her highly valued Arcane Aura increases mana regeneration for all her teammates, while she remains effective throughout the game with very little items. In large fights, she can channel a Freezing Field to obliterate enemies over a wide area, along with using Frostbite to target individuals. However, Crystal Maiden is quite fragile even compared to other supports, and is one of the slowest heroes in the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Gives team mana regeneration.<br/>Numerous slows.<br/>Not item dependent.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low movement speed.<br/>Very fragile.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Crystal Maiden is a well-rounded support who possesses good early-game disabling and roaming capability. She is also an easy hero to learn, as her abilities are straightfoward and give her team strong disabling and nuking potential.<br/>Like most intelligence casters, Crystal Maiden is extremely squishy and easy to kill if focused down by the enemy. This is further exacerbated by her low base movement speed, tied with Invoker for the second-lowest base movement speed in the game. Due to her strong disable potential, she can most effectively mitigate this and by building mobility items that give her a measure of escape, since it doubles to give her initiation potential.<br/>Because her abilities are strongest in the laning stage of a match, Crystal Maiden can greatly aid her team by being extremely active on the map as early as possible.<br/>Crystal Maiden is most often played as her team's hard support, babysitting her safe lane carry and purchasing the support items for her team. Because she does not require farm in order to be effective, she can afford to spend most of a match with few items more than basic boots and a Town Portal Scroll.<br/>Rylai's strong disable repertoire makes her a very strong early roamer, as she can disable and nuke down enemies in order to secure kills in the laning stage.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dark Seer is a semi-support hero, most focused on AOE Battles. He is able to farm safely due to Ion Shell which can also be used to damage his enemies. He can make himself and his allies reach incredible speeds with Surge, along with using Vacuum and Wall of Replica in conjuction with each other to initiate and deal damage using the enemies' own power.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Strong solo offlaner.<br/>Extremely annoying to lane against.<br/>Strong team fight presence.<br/>Excellent at escaping or disengaging.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Melee attack range.<br/>Initiation combo often requires a followup.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>If laning, be sure to harass enemies with Ion Shell by placing it on their melee creeps (for melee heroes) or ranged creeps (for ranged heroes). Additionally, placing Ion Shell on the second allied melee creep to arrive at the creep line is a good way to push the lane as well as create a moving damage-dealing creep that chases enemy heroes. This can make it hard for the enemy carry to last hit, as they have to do it under the tower and while taking damage from creep aggro and ion shell at the same time.<br/>Dark Seer can farm rapidly in lane and jungle thanks to Ion Shell. To jungle, stack the hard and medium camps several times, and then place an ion shell on one of the lesser creeps. The shell should clear out the whole camp(including the stacks). Do this repeatedly to accumulate a large sum of gold. However, be sure to stay within experience range.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dazzle is a support hero most well known for his ability to save his teammates from death using Shallow Grave as well as his physical damage-focused spells. He can slow and later stun single targets with Poison Touch, heal and harm with Shadow Wave, and increase and decrease the armor of his allies and enemies respectively using Weave. His item-independent nature allows him to be played as a hard support and remain effective at all stages of the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Low cooldown ultimate.<br/>Capable of making clutch saves.<br/>Does not require items to perform role.<br/>Strong 5-man enabler.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Offensive spells deal physical damage.<br/>Requires attentiveness and good timing during big team fights.<br/>Not particularly durable himself.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Due to Dazzle's potent defensive abilities, teamfights tend to last longer than usual.<br/>Dazzles abilities require him to be close to his teammates at all times.<br/>Like most intelligence support casters, Dazzle suffers from poor strength and agility, rendering him very weak against all types of damage and making him an easy kill. However, his strength is that he has very high intelligence growth, meaning that he greatly benefits from building scaling mana regen items that maintain his mana pool and facilitate continued use of his low-cooldown spells.<br/>Like all other casting-focused heroes, be particularly mindful of silences that the enemy may attempt to cast on Dazzle during engagements. As a hard support, Dazzle will not always have the gold to purchase items to dispel debuffs from himself, so long-duration silences can easily prevent him from casting his spells to save his teammates in fights.<br/>Because of his ability to save teammates from certain death, Dazzle greatly benefits from building items that aid in his positioning or allow him to cast his spells more easily. As well, this ability to save teammates' lives also means that Dazzle himself may become a priority target for the enemy team to eliminate from the battlefield. Mobility items can kill two birds with one stone, allowing Dazzle to re-position to cast his spells on his teammates, or to quickly escape enemy attempts on his life.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Death Prophet is a powerful spellcaster, who has wide Area of Effect (AoE) spells which specialize in pushing lanes and also devastating enemy defensive towers quickly in order to enter their enemy base, to gain victory within a short period of time. Exorcism can devastate towers in a short period of time, while also being a great ability for teamfights. To keep herself alive, she can use Silence and Spirit Siphon to remain active while still dealing damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Can push lanes and destroy towers quickly.<br/>High survivability.<br/>High base movement speed allows her to chase enemies.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Lack of escape ability.<br/>Long cast animation besides Spirit Siphon.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Death Prophet is best played in the middle lane, easily farming up gold for her items with careful use of Crypt Swarm. Be cautious though as pushing too much with the area damage can leave Krobelus open to ganks, from which her only means of defense is Spirit Siphon, which is never guaranteed to ensure her survival.<br/>All of Krobelus' spells are area of effect, excluding Spirit Siphon. This means that they cannot be blocked by Linken's Sphere, and while Spirit Siphon can be negated by it, its multiple charges and lack of cooldown between their usage can allow you to quickly break the shield and apply a tether, assuming you have charges to spare.<br/>As Death Prophet is good in pushing lanes, keep in mind that in early stage when pushing your lane creeps too near their enemy base or defensive towers they can safe farm without worrying because the distance between their base are shorter, they can use Town Portal Scroll to defend their towers and kill your pushing lane creeps, which allows the enemy side to quickly build their items too.<br/>Try to not stay alone when wonders around the enemy jungle camps, although Death Prophet has high base movement speed, she lacks escape abilities. One hard disable can brings you down if there is no reinforcements nearby.<br/>In a large clash, Krobelus should be swooping around silencing and nuking enemy supports while eroding their health with Exorcism. Carries almost unfailingly have higher armor than supports, and since Exorcism is physical damage, her damage potential is highest when she focuses on the supports.<br/>Given her above-average base movement speed and Phase Boots, Krobelus moves extremely fast and can often avoid damage simply by being faster than her aggressor. A Eul's Scepter of Divinity is also a common pickup on her and increases her movement speed to phenomenal levels. Krobelus tends to chase people around a lot with Exorcism, so high movement speed is a must and can also help the spirits damage enemies around Krobelus while she is safe.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Disruptor is a strong teamfight hero who can control the enemy team's positioning with his potent disables. His Kinetic Field can prevent enemies from leaving the area after being set up, and when used in conjunction with Static Storm can silence and disrupt enemies for extended periods. While he lacks nuking power, he can influence the battlefield in such a way as to greatly hinder the enemy in engagements and prevent gank targets from escaping with Glimpse.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great at catching and ganking heroes.<br/>Strong team fight spells.<br/>Relatively item independent.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Poor stats growth.<br/>Mediocre nuke spell.<br/>Needs good timing to get skills off.<br/>He's useless when enemy is magic immune.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Generally Disruptor is played as a hard support, as he does not require farm in order to perform well. As well, he can be a powerful roamer as his spells can influence enemy positioning, setting up kills for teammates if they have strong damage output.<br/>One of Disruptor's biggest strengths is his extremely short cast animation, which combined with the long cast range on his spells can make him a force to be reckoned with. Positioning is very important for Disruptor, as exploiting these two aspects of the hero allows him to have a very powerful impact on any engagement.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Enchantress is a very flexible Intelligence hero that can be a effective jungle hero with focus in ganking and pushing in early stages of the game. Her Enchant allows her to control neutral creeps, allowing her to use their abilities and gain benefits from their auras. She can heal herself and her allies with Nature's Attendants along with dealing true damage with her auto attacks through Impetus.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Deals pure damage.<br/>Fast movement speed.<br/>Fairly resistant to melee enemies.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very susceptible to burst damage.<br/>Extremely low health points.<br/>Easily countered by Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Enchantress is effective in all stages of the game.<br/> Building  is a very good choice on Enchantress; as aside from the intelligence it gives her it can be used to put some distance between her and her enemy (thus empowering Impetus); or even if very well-timed to use it on Impetus' target while Impetus itself is mid-air; thus hugely increasing its damage. Note however that this will make escaping easier for the enemy if your very powerful Impetus does not kill them.
<br/>Also a teamwork and combo with an allied Pudge's Meat Hook can also maximize your Impetus to its full damage when also combined with Force Staff.<br/>Enchant allows the Enchantress to micromanage just like Chen. Micromanaging is a crucial ability to master for heroes like Enchantress and Chen.<br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Enchantress has a higher attack range than towers, allowing her to attack them without them being able to attack back.<br/>Power Treads and Urn of Shadows are highly recommended for Enchantress.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Enigma is a tactical spellcaster who is known for his incredibly powerful ultimate, Black Hole. Playing him well requires efficient farming, control of Demonic Conversion and good positioning to get the most mileage out of his gravitational abilities. A well-played Enigma can singlehandedly win a teamfight and possibly determine the outcome of a match by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>One of the most efficient junglers in the game.<br/>Strong pushing and team fight capabilities.<br/>Possesses early game ganking potential with Malefice and Eidolon damage.<br/>Black Hole is one of the strongest team fight spells in the game.<br/>Has two large area-of-effect spells that bypasses spell immunity and deals Pure damage.<br/>Entry level hero for players who want to hone their micromanagement skills.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Rather lengthy cooldowns for all of his spells<br/>Very long cooldown on his ultimate, Black Hole.<br/>Black Hole is a channeled ability with short range, thus making him vulnerable to long range disables, silences, or other hazards.<br/>Not naturally tanky.<br/>Most certainly will be in the jungle nearly every game, making him prone to ganks.<br/>Poor management of his Eidolons can give his opponents an edge in their farming.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Enigma works best with allied heroes that have strong AoE capabilities, such as Warlock, Magnus or Queen of Pain.<br/>Enigma can kill Roshan before the 10-minute mark, with the help of Level 3 or 4 Eidolons. For acquiring them, use Demonic Conversion on either a neutral creep if he's on the Radiant side, or a lane creep if he's on the Dire side. An item commonly picked up is a Medallion of Courage, as it allows him to reduce Roshan's armor for a higher damage output. Begin the fight by tanking Roshan yourself, until your Eidolons have multiplied; let the Eidolons take over and apply a Healing Salve. Try to micro the Eidolons to distribute the damage that Roshan does to them. Re-cast Demonic Conversion on one of the Eidolons before they expire and repeat the process (tank, heal up, nuke). If executed properly, Roshan will fall within about one minute.<br/>Enigma's large mana consumption means that Arcane Boots can be an effective boots upgrade. If the player chooses to ignore upgrading boots, Boots of Travel may be taken later on to take advantage of his pushing power.<br/>Necronomicon is a powerful tool when used with Black Hole.<br/>Shadow Blade is a viable alternative to Blink Dagger, if enemies do not have detection.<br/>Force Staff is a great substitute for Blink Dagger, offering some Intelligence.<br/>Rod of Atos also works on Enigma as it helps with both his mana and health.<br/>Blade Mail discourages Heroes outside of your Black Hole from attacking you. Ghost Scepter can be used to a similar effect.<br/>Urn of Shadows may also prove to be a useful item on a team with hardcore gankers as the mana regeneration and strength boost really helps him out early in the game.<br/>Enigma can get Mekansm and Pipe of Insight quickly thanks to his jungling ability.<br/>Linken's Sphere, as an alternative to Black King Bar, is a good item when up against Heroes with single-target disables that go through spell immunity such as Vengeful Spirit.<br/>One of the deadliest combos executed with Black Hole is Sand king's Epicenter. Locking all heroes in allows Sand King to channel it safely, while also making sure the pulses hit 95% of the time, dealing extraordinary damage. Even more so if used in conjunction with Veil of Discord.<br/>Due to it pulling enemies closer together, Enigma synergizes particularly well with heroes with strong but small AoE damage, be it physical (i.e. Sven with his cleave), or otherwise (i.e. Leshrac with Pulse Nova).<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Invoker is one of the most difficult to learn heroes in the game, but also one of the most flexible and powerful casters. As such, his skill floor is not impossibly high, however, his skill ceiling is almost unparalleled, and thus he takes significant amounts of practice in order to learn. Because of his need for quick levels and gold, he is usually played as a mid hero. Due to Invoker's heavy level requirement in order to be effective, it is generally advised to focus on leveling two orbs and getting a value point in the third, rather than trying to level all three equally. While Invoker can be more flexible if he can cast strong spells in all categories, the lack of specialization also limits his potency in areas where his team might need him to be strong. Invoker can only truly reach his full strength at level 25, and as such he needs to be able to effectively contribute to teamfights before reaching that point.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Extremely versatile.<br/>Numerous disables.<br/>Deadly magic combos.<br/>Can push quite well.<br/>Good solo killing ability with Quas-Exort.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Steep learning curve.<br/>Requires significant early farm to be effective.<br/>Not very good at farming compared to other cores.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Quas Exort Invoker needs lots of farm. Getting an early Boots of Travel to get faster around the map and kill creeps is always a good thing. Usually followed by Drums of Endurance, Blink Dagger or Force Staff and Aghanims Scepter.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Jakiro is a tanky intelligence hero with low cooldown damage over time spells and high amounts of magic damage. He offers a large amount of teamfight with Ice Path and Macropyre ,and push with Dual Breath and Liquid Fire<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Tanky lane support.<br/>Fast and efficient lane pusher/tower sieger.<br/>Low cooldown disables.<br/>Large AoE control.<br/>Not item-dependent.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Easily avoidable spells with longer cast times.<br/>Fairly slow.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Jakiro has a slower turn rate than most other Heroes. Coupled with his long cast and attack animations, it makes it difficult for him to land his spells effectively when his enemies are behind him, as nimble opponents are able to see Jakiro's actions being telegraphed to them and can take the appropriate measures to either sidestep or counter them.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Keeper of the Light is an adept support who is capable of aiding his allies and hindering his enemies with his array of spells. He can be a strong babysitter whose presence greatly augments the power of a lane, and transition into a pusher and counter-pusher past the laning stage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Not Item dependent<br/>Can give mana to team and to himself<br/>High movement speed even without boots<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Can die easily<br/>Countered by heroes who don't need mana<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>While he has very strong counter-pushing and support spells, Ezalor is also extremely fragile, with a mere 14 base strength, the lowest in the game (tied with Medusa). As such, positioning is very important, as he needs to be close enough to cast his powerful spells yet also far enough away to be able to avoid being jumped on by the enemy.<br/>Keeper of the Light is highly adept at pushing, as he can replenish teammates' and his own mana with Chakra Magic, allowing profligate use of spells, and Illuminate can severely damage if not outright kill entire creep waves. Along with his ability to re-position allies globally with Recall, Ezalor can be a force to be reckoned with at all points in the game.<br/>Keeper of the Light is a very strong side-laner, able to use his spells to harass the enemy at range and support his team's spell-casting. He is in his element in the safe lane, although he can also be played in a dual off-lane to harass and threaten the enemy's safe-lane carry.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Leshrac is renowned as one of the strongest nukers in the game, who is capable of putting out tremendous amounts of area magical damage in order to destroy his foes. These nukes are strong at killing both heroes and creeps, making Leshrac a powerful foe both in teamfights and while pushing.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great wave clearing<br/>Good tower pushing with Diabolic Edict<br/>Large amounts of AOE magic damage<br/>Good movement speed<br/>Very low cooldown spells<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Bad strength and mediocre armor...<br/>...but still needs to be in the thick of the fight to deal damage<br/>Poor cast animations<br/>Most of his damage output is completely negated by magic immunity<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>One of Leshrac's greatest weaknesses is his long cast animations. In order to counteract this, good positioning and prediction are key, as Leshrac must stand still for an extended period of time before the spell takes its effect.<br/>While Leshrac has tremendous nuking power, much of it is damage over time, requiring him to survive long enough to cast multiple iterations. As such, not only is a large mana pool required in order to sustain such casting, but also enough HP to avoid dying to the enemy while casting.<br/>Mind that because the vast majority of Leshrac's damage output is magical damage, he can be easily countered by spell immunity, and his frailty allows enemies to use his damage against him via Blade Mail. If Leshrac is to be effective in teamfights, he must focus on disabling enemies to prevent them from activating spell immunity, and build spell immunity himself both to increase his survivability and block Blade Mail damage.<br/> Leshrac can usually be played as a core or a support.
<br/>Played as a support, Leshrac has powerful disables that can greatly aid his team in fights, and can deal tremendous damage to enemy towers as well. His nuking spells also allow him to obtain gold fairly reliably for buying more support items. A support Leshrac should focus on purchasing utility items to aid his team in fights.<br/>Played as a core, Leshrac has tremendous pushing and nuking power that can allow him to deal large amounts of damage in teamfights, or push lanes and take towers by himself. Once he has enough mana, he can use his nuking spells to farm very effectively as well. Core Leshrac should aim to build items that enhance his survivability and casting, as he must stay alive in order to put out the damage to kill enemies, and requires steady mana regeneration in order to fuel his costly and low-cooldown spells.<br/>All of Leshrac's spells have differing priorities to max out depending on his farm priority, team lineup and expected opposition. There is no one-size-fits-all build, as certain abilities may greatly synergize with those of allies, cover for their weaknesses, or exploit a flaw in the enemy's lineup.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lich is a ranged intelligence hero that is primarily used to win the laning stage of the game with Sacrifice. Sacrifice denies the opponent experience points and gives them to you and your allies. Once past the laning stage, Lich is still a threat with Chain Frost. Lich does not have any strong escape mechanism and is rather frail, so proper positioning is a must.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Almost always able to dominates the laning stage and thus securing the early advantage for your team<br/>Simple to play, great for beginners<br/>A good nuker with spammable Frost Blast<br/>Able to destroy the enemy team if they are poorly positioned and huddled close with Chain Frost.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Has no escape capabilities and is quite frail<br/>Is not as strong past the laning/early stage of the game<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Lich<br/><br/>mana<br/>Intelligence<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lina is a powerful ranged intelligence hero that can be played as a support or a semi-carry. Her abilities allow her to nuke and stun multiple heroes at once and her strong ultimate can annihilate low health heroes. Her passive allows her right-clicks to far exceed that of other typical intelligence heroes, giving her a very respectable amount of physical damage output. Played well, Lina is an extremely strong ganking hero who can kill out of position heroes all by herself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Strong AoE nukes.<br/>Very powerful single target nuke.<br/>Long attack range.<br/>Deals fairly high physical damage with passive.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Slow cast animations.<br/>Slow attack animation.<br/>No mobility.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Lina has one of the longest attack ranges in the game, but also the slowest attack animation. Time your attacks well to get last hits.<br/>Always cancel the backswing animation after casting your spells, as Lina suffers from long animation times.<br/>In teamfights it can be very beneficial to quickly focus on low-HP or support heroes, as Lina has very good nuking abilities.<br/>If Lina has the basic items she needs, it is wise to augment her physical attack for the sake of Fiery Soul. Almost uniquely among Intelligence supports, Lina's autoattacks becomes a serious threat if she attains a level advantage (owing to her enormous intelligence growth and her passive ability).<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lion is a powerful spellcaster and is mostly played as support or ganker hero due to his disabling spells. He is best to partner with auto attack carries or another spellcaster to finish enemies quickly. His Earth Spike and his Hex make him a formidible disabler, while his Mana Drain can prevent enemy heroes from casting spells if done effectively and allowed to drain. His Finger of Death can easily nuke the chosen enemy, dealing incredible damage to help his allies or himself finish a kill.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>One of the best disabler hero.<br/>Good early/mid game nuker.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Easily targeted due to low health.<br/>Slow movement.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Lion is renowned for being one of the strongest disabling supports in the game. He has two hard disables in Hex and Earth Spike, which allow him to set up kills in virtually any situation once he hits level 2, potentially giving his team a strong early advantage with his combination of nukes and disables. Be sure to layer your disables properly, in order to lock down a target for the longest possible duration instead of stacking the disables and wasting one or both.<br/>Like most other intelligence-based casters, Lion suffers from low strength and agility growth, making him frail and easy to kill if focused down. Due to this and his strong array of disables, Lion benefits greatly from building survivability and mobility items, as his great intelligence growth combined with his Mana Drain ability means that he is never wanting for mana to cast his spells.<br/>Beware that due to his single-target nature, all of Lion's spells can be blocked with Linken's Sphere, or even worse reflected with Lotus Orb. As such, be extremely careful about when and where you cast your spells, and be sure to regularly check the enemy's inventory so that you know if they are building towards either item.<br/> Because of his powerful early disabling potential, Lion can be played in a variety of ways.
<br/>In most cases, Lion is played as a hard support, protecting his safe lane carry by pulling neutral camps and harassing the enemy off-laner. He is also able to set up kills with his disables if he is able to get within range to cast them on the enemy, whether it be their off-laner or rotating to gank their mid-laner.<br/>True to his name, Lion is also a strong roamer who can prowl and pounce on enemies in their lanes, using his disables to hold them in place while his teammates kill them.<br/>In unusual circumstances, Lion can also be a respectable mid, as his good base damage allows him to compete with other mid heroes with last-hits, and his disables allow him to set up the enemy mid if supports rotate for a gank. The early gold and levels can allow him to transition into a strong roaming who can catch enemies with his disables and nuke them down with Finger of Death.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Necrophos is a highly survivable intelligence hero whose power scale with how long he survives in a fight and eventually how long the game becomes due to his capability of taking out crucial targets and pro-longing their death with his ultimate Reaper's Scythe. Despite having a heal in his kit, Necrophos is not supportive by nature and should not be used as one as for a support, healing is all he can contribute and he is not that good at it.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Deceptively durable when played correctly.<br/>Very effective in any teamfight, especially long ones.<br/>Fairly straightforward with his spells, making him easy to play.<br/>Can lengthen respawn times of key enemy Heroes, or those that bought back.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Slightly item dependent.<br/>Not naturally durable.<br/>Not too reliable escape mechanism.<br/>Sluggish movement speed.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Necrophos is countered in lane by any hero with high health regeneration, such as Dragon Knight and Quas-focused Invoker, or a hero with lifesteal capabilities; because he relies on inflicting constant, gradual damage with Death Pulse and Heartstopper Aura. Heroes with these attributes will resist this in lane against Necrophos, keeping high enough health to prevent death by Reaper's Scythe.<br/>Refresher Orb combined with an Aghanim's Scepter will greatly increase your chance at winning the match if it reaches the late game. If you manage to kill 2 enemy heroes in succession, the sheer duration of their respawn time might be enough to decide the match, more so if the victims are key heroes in their lineup.<br/>Necrophos can very easily be built as a tank and in most circumstances should be; you may gear for strength (he does not need excessive intelligence as his basic attacks are not too useful, and Death Pulse refunds mana for each kill he gets). The reason he is usually built as a tank is because he needs to stay alive in violent encounters to heal his allies (a good enemy team will focus him first), and also because the longer he is alive for, the more damage his aura will do and the better chance he has of landing a crucial Reaper's Scythe.<br/> Although it may be wise to build some mana pool increasing items such as , Point Booster or other Intelligence items may do so anyway; because if Necrophos has used all his abilities and failed to get a kill, he would wind up and be unable to cast any more of his spells. Moreover, if his auto attack is not too great, getting last hits to regenerate some mana can be problematic.
<br/>Utility items, such as Mekansm, Pipe of Insight and Guardian Greaves are more useful for Necrophos, because he can inflict constant damage with Heartstopper Aura simply by avoiding death and synergizes with his Death Pulse to keep his team alive. In that sense, Crimson Guard is also a viable luxury item for Utility Necrophos as it will greatly increase his durability while also providing a useful team ability.<br/>Radiance is a viable item for Necrophos because of his durability. This also synergizes well with Heartstopper Aura making prolonged team-fights a dangerous prospect for the enemy team.<br/>Necrophos is effective against invisible heroes that tend to stalk their prey as his Heartstopper Aura does damage while they are in stealth, his Death Pulse hits invisible units, and his Reaper's Scythe will prevent them from escaping via invisibility before they die. He is also very good against heroes with abilities that deplete their own health such as Pudge, Slark, and Centaur Warrunner ( Huskar is an exception since his Berserker's Blood will almost always prevent you from killing him with Reaper's Scythe), but Necrophos should first be durable enough to take on these kinds of risk/reward heroes.<br/>Necrophos' role is notoriously debated; while his abilities appear supportive at their core, his Reaper's Scythe is a tool used to secure kills only for himself (much like Axe's Culling Blade). This is atypical for a standard support hero, because supports usually attempt to confer gold and experience to the team's carry. The duplicity of his carry/support role stems from his unique stance in encounters; his kit is largely supportive until an enemy hero grows weak, at which point Necrophos has the capacity to kill said enemy himself. He is best viewed as a utility focused semi-carry, rather than a full-fledged support hero.<br/>Dagon is more useful on Necrophos than other heroes because it not only deals burst damage, but also allows you to quickly deal more damage from your ultimate.<br/>  can be used in conjunction with  and  to deal significantly more damage. If you are also in a possession of a high level , a quick Reaper's Scythe to Ether Blast to Energy Burst combo can decimate full health enemy heroes with total health points lower than 2000, assuming they have the standard 25% magic resistance.
<br/>It is worth noting that Ether Blast temporarily increases the magical damage dealt per missing health from the standard 0.4/0.6/0.9 to 0.56/0.84/1.26, thus also increases the instant-kill threshold.<br/>Assuming a level 5 Energy Burst and a level 3 Reaper's Scythe with an Aghanim's Scepter is used against an enemy with 25% magic resistance while being ethereal, you will deal 840 damage from Dagon and 1058.4 damage from Reaper's Scythe, to a total of 1898.4 damage (not including damage from Ether Blast and Reaper's Scythe damage due to it). If the match reaches the late-game, you still can burst down a full health non-magic-immune enemy carry with standard magic resistance during teamfights, potentially turning it into your team's favor.<br/>Octarine Core is a viable item if you plan to do an aggressive approach as your Death Pulse will heal Necrophos for 130 + 50 per hero hit and reduce its cooldown to 3.75 seconds. If you also manage to kill an enemy with Reaper's Scythe, the massive damage coupled with the heal from Death Pulse will in some cases be enough to heal Necrophos from critically low health to full health. However, it is advised that you build a Bloodstone too because the Octarine Core will increase your mana consumption and is a lot less effective than Bloodstone at restoring mana.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ogre Magi is the embodiment of "dumb muscle". While having a meager mana pool for an intelligence hero, his health pool can become one of the largest in the game. Not needing very many items, Ogre is potent at all points in the game, being able to easily trade hits early on, burst foes in the mid game, and help with late game pushes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Has the third highest Strength gain at 3.2 per level, with 23 base strength.<br/>Second highest base armor at 8<br/>Has a stun and a slow in his kit<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Second lowest base intelligence and third lowest intelligence gain<br/>Slow movement speed with no mobility skills<br/>One of the few melee intelligence heroes<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Take advantage of Ogre's tankiness early on. Trade hits with enemies while taking very little damage yourself<br/>Once your lane partner is safe for a little bit, go gank other lanes. Your stun and slow should make getting kills really easy<br/>Manage your mana. Ogre can run out really quickly if you're not careful, so try not to use more than is needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Oracle is a versatile spell caster whose spells can be used defensively or offensively depending on how the combinations of spells are used. A well timed ultimate can change a surprise attack from the enemy into a failed gank. Oracle is not very mobile and is susceptible to getting picked or focused first in fights if poorly positioned.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Strong spammable nukes<br/>Great spell utility, Fate's Edict can be used to negate magical damage or disarm opponents for example.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Lacks any strong area of effect spells<br/>Inexperienced players might cause more harm than good to their team or aid the enemy if they cast the wrong spells at the wrong time<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Oracle's strength lies not in his individual spells, but in how he utilizes his spells in combination with each other, as well as those of his teammates. This means that playing Oracle effectively requires communication and coordination with allied players, as well as good reflexes and knowledge of what each ability does.<br/>Like most other intelligence supports, Oracle suffers from poor strength and agility, making him extremely vulnerable to any types of damage. Because of his array of abilities, Oracle should build items that provide mobility rather than survivability, since he can use mobility items both to position himself for casting his spells and to escape enemy attempts to kill him. As well, his heavy reliance on spell casting means that he should invest in increasing the size of his mana pool and acquiring a reliable source of mana replenishment.<br/>Be mindful that while Oracle has strong healing and nuking abilities, he possesses no hard disables, meaning that he is unable to interrupt channeling items/abilities, nor is he able to prevent enemies from casting spells or using items. In order to counter enemy spell and item usage, Oracle must himself purchase items to allow him to hard-disable the enemy, or rely on his allies to do so.<br/>Oracle's spells all have very high cast ranges, and his good base movement speed allows him to get into position to use his spells relatively easily. However, his extremely low turn rate means that he cannot maneuver as easily as other heroes, so his ability to turn around to cast spells in surprise situations may allow the enemy to catch him off-guard. This means that prior knowledge of the enemy's positions and movements can allow him to orient himself to face the threat axis and be ready to use his spells immediately, making ward vision very important.<br/>With his long attack range, respectable cast animation, and extremely low base attack time, Oracle is a very powerful harasser in the laning stage, able to inflict harass damage on enemy heroes safely and frequently, as well as deny effectively with his respectable base damage. Combined with his array of impact-heavy abilities and high base movement speed, this allows Oracle to be a very strong lane support who can very easily protect his safe lane carry.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Outworld Devourer is a carry and a disabler. He is one of the few damage dealers who can also reset fights, break chain stuns, and save teammates thanks to his Astral Imprisonment. He is also one of the few heroes who can reliably deal pure damage thanks to Arcane Orb, which can also steal intelligence from heroes and does extra damage against summons and illusions. Nearby allies benefit from Essence Aura as they have a chance to regain a percentage of their max mana each spell cast. Finally, Sanity's Eclipse not only deals damage in a large radius based on Outworld Devourer's current intelligence, but also remove 40% of their maximum mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Deals massive amounts of pure damage.<br/>Capable of snowballing out of control.<br/>Punishes mana dependent and low intelligence heroes.<br/>High starting move speed.<br/>Chain stun breaker<br/>Excellent gank setup<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Damage is nullified by spell immunity or when silenced.<br/>Ineffective vs high intelligence heroes.<br/>Bad at destroying buildings.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Stealing intelligence from enemy heroes for 80 seconds (140 with the talent) can make a big difference between enemy heroes and give you a high advantage.<br/>At level 7 (which is where Essence Aura can be maxed out) with Power Treads to intelligence, 2x Null Talisman, Force Staff (or Staff of Wizardry because it have same intelligence) and 8-10 intelligence steal from enemy hero or Point Booster (to Aghanim's Scepter for great crowd control) its nearly impossible to lose your mana.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Puck is an extremely elusive hero who misleads and disrupts enemies with a combination of disabling items and abilities. Though vulnerable, Puck is able to initiate on enemy teams, silencing and locking down opponents before teleporting away in a glowing orb. Puck's arsenal of tricks and items require sharp situational awareness during teamfights, and can be overwhelming to newer players. Nonetheless, a well-played Puck can escape nearly any situation, and return to repeatedly disable opponents for his teammates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very hard to pin down.<br/>Fairly mobile.<br/>Good lane ganker.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Slow turn rate.<br/>Requires multitasking.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Puck is almost always played in mid, but can also play a solo lane against multiple opponents due to his slippery nature.<br/>As a mid hero, Puck has easy access to Runes with Illusory Orb, and can gank the side lanes effectively with Dream Coil.<br/>With a Blink Dagger, Puck becomes a capable albeit fragile initiator.<br/>Puck deals significant magical nuke damage in the early game with Illusory Orb and Waning Rift.<br/>Puck's abilities, as well as his tendency to buy items with active abilities, makes him a busy multitasker in teamfights. Knowing when to use which ability/item is key to playing him well.<br/>A good initiation combo is as follows: Blink Dagger, then Waning Rift, then Dream Coil, then Illusory Orb through as many enemies as possible but in a safe direction, Phase Shift to remain safe, then Ethereal Jaunt to teleport to the Orb. The silence from Waning Rift is long enough to execute this combination.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Pugna is a utility caster whose spells give him strong nuking power and offer utility in various situations. He offers strong teamfight contribution and can push and counter-push very effectively with his nukes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High mobility<br/>Devastating nukes<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low health pool<br/>Low armor<br/>Sloppy attack animation and attack speed.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Possessing the second-highest base movement speed in the game (tied with Luna) and a shorter-than-average cast animation, Pugna can be a very mobile hero who can get his spells off more easily than most other casters. However, his pitiful strength means that being caught by the enemy often means that he can be easily killed.<br/>Because of a combination of his squishiness and reliance on spell-casting, Pugna benefits most from building items that boost the size of his HP pool and provide him with mana regeneration. Because he has the highest intelligence growth in the game, Pugna's mana pool can support his spell casting relatively easily, so obtaining percentage-based mana regen can keep him from needing to return to base as often.<br/>Beware that despite his awesome nuking potential, Pugna does not have any hard disables, and thus enemies can easily escape him either by running away or channeling a Town Portal Scroll. In order to reliably nuke down and kill enemy heroes, Pugna must rely on allied disables, or purchase disable items himself.<br/>In general, Pugna requires farm and levels in order to be effective, however, he can also contribute to teamfights with levels alone.<br/>Pugna can be played as a solo mid-laner in order to bring out his potential. Regular use of Nether Blast allows Pugna to easily nuke down creep waves, as well as harass the enemy mid, and can also be used to quickly destroy the enemy tower if needed, giving Pugna's team an early advantage in gold and map control. Afterward, Pugna can transition into using Nether Blast to farm and push, and purchasing items to increase his effectiveness in teamfights.<br/>When not given farm priority, Pugna can be played as a side-lane support, using Nether Blast to harass and Decrepify as a setup disable, as well as using Nether Blast to push down towers early in a match. By stacking and pulling camps, Pugna can earn himself experience and gold to buy more support items for his team as needed, and level up his abilities to increase his teamfight contribution.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Queen of Pain is a fearsome mid laner who has impressive mobility through Blink, along with several spells that deal significant damage. Despite her sizeable amounts of damage, she is very fragile and weak to disables, and must be played smartly in order to succeed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Great blink<br/>Can burst down foes quickly with her spells<br/>Two good AoE spells in Scream of Pain and Sonic Wave<br/>Her ultimate ignores Magic Resistance and Spell Immunity as it deals Pure damage<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low HP and Armor<br/>Is suddenly very vulnerable if she blinks in and fails to kill a target with her combo<br/>Sonic Wave can be dodged<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Queen of Pain is fairly straightforward to play as none of her damaging abilities require careful positioning or specific timings or combinations. Instead, like Anti-Mage, Queen of Pain starts to shine through proper Blink usage and good itemization, allowing her to farm with great efficiency and be a threat all over the map. Blink also allows her to jump in and out of fights for some potentially cheeky plays at low hp.<br/>Her generic combo would be to blink in on a target and immediately use Scream of Pain as it has no cast time, slow him down with a Shadow Strike to help land your Sonic Wave. Follow with right clicks and an extra blink + scream to finish him off.... But you will usually have a couple of items you will need to add to the equation.<br/>QoP is superb at chasing her prey, but is very delicate and is often in more danger from enemy towers than enemy heroes. Gearing for HP regeneration may be advisable, as in a critical situation you can Blink to an inaccessible place and wait to recuperate. Bottle will also help with this.<br/> If being chased (a common situation for QoP), an often-useful tactic is to blink behind the enemies pursuing you. They will typically assume you blinked ahead and continue on in that direction, allowing for an escape.
<br/>A more cautious strategy is to run in without using Blink, saving it for a potential escape. This may be necessary against high-damage enemy heroes, as QoP is very frail and in encounters should try to avoid being attacked at all.<br/>In a late-game encounter, QoP is best used by hiding until such time as the enemies' more powerful spells are on cooldown, allowing her to Blink in and inflict huge damage on multiple enemies owing to her AoE capabilities without putting her at risk of being killed by powerful spells.<br/>Similarly to Lina, QoP has very high burst damage capabilities, but is delicate and not suited to long encounters because of her spells' high mana costs. This can be remedied with items such as Bloodstone and Linken's Sphere, as well as Aghanim's Scepter to reduce Sonic Wave's cooldown.<br/>Be aware that Rupture will be calculated against the distance traversed should you Blink shorter than the max distance. You can avoid the damage by blinking max distance (1300 units) and moving immediately in that direction.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Rubick is a flexible spellcaster, best known for his ability to copy enemies last used spells to use against them. He is commonly picked as a counter to big teamfight spells such as Tidehunter's Ravage, Enigma's Black Hole and Earthshaker Echo Slam.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Instant cast time for stolen spells<br/>High mana capacity.<br/>Reliable Stun and Nuke that works very well in early-mid game.<br/>High Magic Resistance.<br/>Not item-dependent.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Low health pool<br/>Lack of damage<br/>Rubick's strength and effectiveness depends on Enemy's team picks.<br/>One of the hardest heroes to play in this game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/> Despite possessing attributes typical of the archetypal support caster, the possession of Spell Steal allows Rubick to be built differently. While he only has one innate disable, he should generally be built with mobility and casting in mind, with items that help with initiation taking priority due to the utility that Spell Steal provides.
<br/>Despite his high base intelligence, Rubick suffers from mediocre intelligence growth, and his spells have relatively flat mana costs; additionally, consistent use of Spell Steal will further tax his mana pool due to the need to support not only his innate spells, but also any stolen abilities, particularly mana-expensive ultimates. The flat mana cost for his abilities means that they cost a larger fraction of his mana pool in the early game, and thus limits his operational time in the field. Items that grant Rubick a larger mana pool and increased mana regeneration are very helpful for keeping him in the game.<br/>Although a great disabler and potential initiator with the right items and stolen spells, Rubick is still very frail and can be easily killed if caught out of position by the enemy team. Rubick should focus on building items that grant him more mobility rather than increasing the size of his HP pool, as increased mobility can help with both initiation and escape rather than simply delay his death in the face of enemy attacks.<br/>During the mid- and late-game, stealing key teamfight spells and keeping yourself alive should be your main goals. Spell Steal only has a 0.1 second cast time and high cast range, so quick fingers and fast reaction time will give your team a huge advantage.<br/> Rubick is a very flexible caster who can be played as a support, roamer or core farmer. The role that he is selected for will largely change his how much farm he gets, and in turn how effective he can be with his abilities. However, his skill and item build remains largely the same.
<br/>As a support, Rubick generally performs lane harassment and creep pulling duties, getting low farming and experience priority. Telekinesis allows him to catch the enemy off-laner and pull them back, as well as making chain-disables by his tri-lane easier to execute due to Telekinesis's ability to reposition the enemy precisely.<br/>As a roamer, Rubick aims to disable and disposition enemies with Telekinesis, setting up kills for his lanes to give them an early advantage. A roaming Rubick prioritizes in mobility, disable and nuking.<br/>As a core, Rubick goes to the mid lane, using Fade Bolt to nuke and harass, and Telekinesis to set up kills if his supports and roamers rotate to mid for a gank. Due to being given farm and experience priority, mid Rubick's goal is to get level 6 as fast as possible and use his gold and level advantage to start moving around the map for ganks and kills. Gold should be spent on mobility items, particularly a fast Blink Dagger, and utility and disable items to turn teamfights to his team's advantage.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Demon is an excellent defensive support capable of resetting fights, counter-initiating, and dealing with blinks and magic-immunity. His Disruption working well as a way to break up chain stuns as well as set up an ally's stun, debuffing the enemy with Soul Catcher is a 50% damage increase, while his ultimate Demonic Purge slows and dispels enemies even through magic immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Magic immunity piercing debuffs<br/>Chain stun breaker<br/>Excellent gank setup<br/>Wave clear and tower push with Shadow Poison and Disruption illusions<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>No hard crowd control<br/>Offers little sustain in and after fights<br/>Nuke requires time to build up damage<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Disruption<br/><br/>Shadow Poison<br/><br/>Blink Dagger<br/><br/>Soul Catcher<br/><br/>Demonic Purge<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter<br/><h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Shaman is a very powerful ganker and pusher, who possesses very strong disables and nukes. His spells allow him to disable lone enemies for extended periods of time, making them easy prey for his teammates, or to make short work of creep waves and towers.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Strong early game nukes<br/>Long duration disables<br/>Works well with almost any hero<br/>Can splitpush lanes and take towers quickly<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very mana dependent<br/>No escape mechanism<br/>Low mobility<br/>More item and level dependent than other supports<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>Because of his strong disables and powerful nukes, Shadow Shaman benefits greatly from building intelligence items that extend the size of his mana pool and provide mana regen, as well as mobility items to allow him to get close enough to cast his disables and nukes on enemies. The additional mobility also aids in survivability by allowing him to re-position himself to escape enemy attempts to kill him.<br/>Because Shadow Shaman's disables are all unit-targeted, they can reliably disable enemies if he gets close enough to them. However, this also means that they can be easily negated by Linken's Sphere or even reflected with Lotus Orb, so be sure to check the enemy's inventory prior to committing expensive disables.<br/> Rhasta can be played as either a support or a core. His farm priority mainly dictates how effective he can be in either role, with small differences in how he is played.
<br/>As a support, Shadow Shaman should focus on babysitting his team's safe lane carry, and setting up kills with his disables when rotating for ganks. As he has two hard disables, getting close enough to a lone enemy can often ensure a kill if his teammates have enough damage output.<br/>In general, if Shadow Shaman is played as a core, he is played as a solo mid where he can get fast levels to make use of his spells early on. A mid Shadow Shaman should focus on maxing out Ether Shock to farm and harass, push out the lane to clear the way to grabbing a rune, and attempt to get kills on the enemy mid once he is level 6.<br/><h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Silencer is an intelligence-based teamfight-oriented hero that scales exceptionally well thanks to his innate ability Intelligence Steal. He is able to render any magic user useless with his Last Word and Arcane Curse. His signature ultimate, Global Silence can make a swift table turns in teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Can steal 2 intelligence for every hero he killed or die nearby him.<br/>Can be played either as a support or as a carry.<br/>Can harass enemies in the lane effectively.<br/>Deals pure damage with Glaives of Wisdom.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Has no real "instant" silence besides his ultimate.<br/>Has no escape abilities and is easy to gank.<br/>Weakness against Black King Bar limits his effectiveness as a carry.<br/>Is less effective if he didn't have a good early game and didn't steal enough intelligence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Silencer can be played as a carry or support. As a carry, he focuses on taking fights and getting kills and assists with his spells, dealing tremendous damage with his auto-attacks while using his spells to prevent the enemy from easily retaliating. As a support, he focuses on harassing the enemy with his spells and building support-utility items while reserving his ultimate for major teamfights.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Skywrath Mage is a very strong nuker whose spells allow him to deal tremendous amounts of magic damage to enemy heroes. If left uninterrupted, he is a force to be reckoned with and is capable of destroying enemy heroes by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>High burst damage from spells<br/>Long cast range<br/>High mana pool<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very fragile<br/>Low armor<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Beware that Skywrath Mage's extremely low strength and agility gives him very little HP and armor, resulting in severe vulnerability against physical damage. The combination of low HP and high nuke damage also renders him vulnerable to reflected damage, meaning that enemies who buy a Blade Mail can cause him to connive in his own destruction if they have more HP than him.<br/>Due to the long cast range on his spells, Skywrath is capable of casting his spells on enemies safely from behind his allies, in order to mitigate his frailty. As such, positioning is very important as inadvertently getting too close to the enemy can result in his demise. His high base movement speed and near-instant cast animations allow him to take advantage of his long range, however his moves must be planned and calculated as his slow turn rate counteracts this.<br/>Skywrath Mage has the third-highest intelligence growth in the game, which means that his mana pool is often large enough to accommodate all of his spells. However, beware that this can be turned against you depending on the enemies you are facing, as certain abilities are particularly effective against Skywrath Mage, such as Nether Ward, Mana Void and Mana Burn. Plan for counters against such situations if needed, and be prepared to purchase items to shield yourself from such abilities.<br/>Due to the potency of his nukes, Skywrath Mage is capable of being played in a number of ways.<br/>In the most general case, Skywrath Mage is a potent safe-lane support. He can spam Arcane Bolt to harass the enemy off-laner away while dealing respectable amounts of damage, and can slow them from range and silence them during kill attempts. As a casting support, he is capable of dealing large amounts of damage relying only on his spells, meaning that he can be effective with just levels.<br/>Due to his strong nuking power, Skywrath Mage can be a very potent mid-laner. His ability to wear down his lane opponent from range, as well as disable and burst them down with his spells, can make him a powerful threat in almost any match-up. With good gold and experience gain, Skywrath Mage's spells can become a force to be reckoned with, allowing him to burst down and kill enemy heroes with relative ease.<br/>Skywrath Mage's combination of high movement speed and powerful nuking ability make him a strong roamer and ganker. Possession of a long-range slow in Concussive Shot and a silence in Ancient Seal allow him to apply disables to enemies and burst them down with his spells, especially if combined with a partner with disables. As he requires experience and gold to avoid falling off in the late game, getting early kills can help him to remain a powerful threat throughout a match.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Storm Spirit Storm Spirit is a very mobile ganker who thrives on an aggressive play style. While he is very mana-hungry and difficult to master, he more than makes up for this by rewarding players with aggressive mindsets and good dexterity, who can use his abilities to jump on foes from extremely long distances, pummel them down with tremendous amounts of magical damage, and escape before their allies can turn on him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Incredibly mobile.<br/>High snowball potential.<br/>Low cooldowns on all of his skills.<br/>Can reliably solo-kill most fragile heroes.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Can run out of mana very quickly without proper management.<br/>Very vulnerable in the early game.<br/>Very farm dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>In order to make the most of his mobility, Storm Spirit's first priority should be to build items that give him both mana and mana regen. Ball Lightning allows him to initiate and escape at will, making him very hard to catch in the hands of a skilled player, however it consumes large amounts of his mana pool, meaning that life or death literally rests on how much mana Storm Spirit can muster up when needed.<br/>Storm Spirit is most generally played in the mid lane, as his abilities make him an extremely powerful hero to have early levels and gold on. While he is quite weak and vulnerable before he hits level 6, he becomes a force to be reckoned with once he obtains access to his ultimate.<br/><h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Techies is a very unorthodox hero in the game, as their team contribution comes mainly from placing traps outside of combat rather than engaging enemies in fights. Playing Techies requires good map awareness and game sense in order to know when and where to place traps.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Very high attack range.<br/>Excellent base armor (7).<br/>Not dependent on teamfights to be effective.<br/>Very long root with Stasis Trap.<br/>Can deny self with Blast Off!.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Very mana dependent in the early game.<br/>Low starting health.<br/>Lowest starting damage.<br/>Easily countered by silence and summoned units.<br/>Very low mobility.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Techies are also one of the few heroes able to truly mess with the enemy. Play mind games with them. Do not force yourself into any habits, while making sure you continually adapt to theirs.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tinker is a very mobile nuking hero with powerful pushing and disabling potential depending on how he is built. He should be played around his ultimate, as it allows him to cast his spells and use his abilities multiple times in a single engagement.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Powerful magical and pure damage nukes, high damage AoE magic damage.<br/>Very hard to push against without specific items or team composition.<br/>Skillful players can outplay multiple opponents by themselves.<br/>Generally extremely effective against single targets with the use of items in conjunction with Rearm.<br/>Semi-Global presence when Boots of Travel are acquired.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Item dependent<br/>Vulnerable to lockdown, fragile, no innate escape mechanism.<br/>High skill ceiling, high levels of awareness and dexterity needed to play effectively.<br/>No answer to Magic Immunity.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>When pushing out lanes, care must be taken to avoid being jumped on by the enemy. Tinker is a very frail hero who, despite his mobility, can be easily killed if caught and disabled.<br/>As well, while Tinker can find farm quite easily by pushing out multiple lanes, doing so can deprive your own teammates of farm, particularly your carries. Combined with the above, this can lead to dangerous situations where your team is unable to do anything without you, and can lead to a loss in the long run as the enemy is able to kill your under-farmed teammates easily if they manage to kill you once. As such, it is recommended not to push out lanes too aggressively or take farm away from your carries if possible.<br/>In general, Tinker is best played in the mid lane, as his skill set allows him to take on most other mids reliably and the farm and early levels allow him to become active much more quickly. He can nuke down and harass the opposing mid and push his lane at will with his abilities, allowing for good rune control.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Visage is a highly flexible Hero, able to push and gank very effectively, packing within his abilities a massive nuke with very low cooldown and one powerful slow, useful for taking down enemies when ganking. He is also a strong teamfighter, able to cause tons of damage and apply long-lasting disables with his Familiars, which give Visage its fame for his difficult learning curve, due to his dependence on effective micromanagement of those. Once mastered, Visage becomes a devastating support, with a mix between physical damage, magical damage and long length disables and able to push, gank and fight with his Familiars.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Deals large amounts of single target damage.<br/>Can end up being extremely durable.<br/>Capable of quickly transitioning into a semi-carry with successful ganks.<br/>Movement Speed and attack speed drain, which can be useful in many ways.<br/>AoE long length stun.<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Vulnerable early game.<br/>Level dependent.<br/>Requires intermediate micro skills.<br/>Loses effectiveness if Familiars are dead.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Visage's abilities make him a very strong hero to have in teamfights, as he can bring a powerful array of nukes and disables to bear. He can also use his spells effectively in ganks to jump on and disable targets with little warning and burst them down quickly.<br/>Unlike most intelligence supports, Visage is a very survivable caster due to possessing a high strength growth and powerful damage resistance in Gravekeeper's Cloak. Combined with his other spells, Visage can engage enemies head-on in teamfights and hold his own in the initiation phase.<br/>With a 0.2 second cast animation and long cast ranges on his spells, Visage has great reach if played properly. However, his low base movement speed and slow turn rate also make him relatively sluggish, so positioning is important if he is to take advantage of his strengths.<br/>While Visage is mainly played as a support, he can also become a strong semi-carry if given some farm priority. He can be played as a hard support or a farming support, depending on what his team needs, and transition into a roaming, ganking and split-pushing role.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Warlock is a powerful spellcaster capable of turning the tide of teamfights, bringing the Hell powers with his abilities, bonding his enemies to suffer with the same catastrophic fate. He is almost entirely dependent on good positioning, due to lack of front line abilities, but has great cast ranges on his abilities, allowing you to disrupt your enemies from long distances. Warlock also brings a good healing that can also be used to damage enemies, doing a fine job as a lane partner. His ultimate, Chaotic Offering, calls down a powerful summon along with a magic immunity piercing stun that covers the battlefield almost entirely, causing some huge troubles to your enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Many teamfight abilities.<br/>Has a good heal/damage ability.<br/>The Golem can unleash tons of AoE damage, rather efficient for farming waves or the jungle.<br/>Huge AoE 84% slow ( Upheaval).<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>No good escape ability<br/>Mildly low mana pool.<br/>Upheaval requires channeling.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Warlock is renowned as a strong teamfight hero whose spells can shift the tide of engagements against multiple foes. While he does not possess any immediate single-target hard disables or instant-damage nukes, his spells provide powerful area disable and crowd control, making him a dangerous foe in teamfights.<br/>Despite being an intelligence caster, Warlock has very respectable strength growth, giving him strong survivability against magic and pure damage nukes. However, he also suffers from extremely poor base agility and agility growth, making him vulnerable to physical damage.<br/>Because he relies mostly on casting spells in order to be effective, Warlock should build items that provide him with more mana, mana regen, and mobility. Having a sustainable source of mana allows Warlock to remain active on the map to support his team, and mobility allows Warlock to more easily position to cast his spells. Once he meets his minimum requirements, he can focus on building utility items to help his team, and survivability items to ensure that he does not die before getting his spells off.<br/>Keep in mind that Warlock has a very long cast animation, 0.5 seconds on all but Fatal Bonds. This means that positioning and planning ahead are key to using the hero effectively, as his spells take more time to cast than most other heroes.<br/>In general, Warlock should be played as a safe lane support hero rather than as a core farmer. Although he can scale better than most other supports due to the nature of his spells, he is more dependent on levels than on gold, so foregoing farm in favor of supporting can still allow him to contribute to his team.<br/>When you play Warlock, awareness is key. He does not have a good escape, and can be easily caught by ganks if there is no vision.<br/>Warlock can often turn the tide of teamfights due to his many teamfighting abilities, so always carry a Town Portal Scroll and try to get to a team fight as soon as possible if you were not in it initially.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Windranger is a very flexible hero who can be played in any lane, and who can perform many roles from support-disabler to DPS carry.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Good escape<br/>Great pusher<br/>Strong at any stage of the game<br/>High skill cap<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Farm and level dependent<br/>Low armor/spell resistance<br/>Single-target damage<br/>Requires good positioning<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>In general, Windranger should focus on either maximizing her potential in disabling enemies, or increasing her raw damage and upgrading her ultimate for physical DPS; it is not feasible to aim for both. The former may be done as a support or core, however the latter is only feasible if Windranger is given farm priority.<br/>Played as an off-laner, it is recommended to get Windrun as your first skill in order to give yourself survivability against the enemy's supports. You have decent last-hitting capability due to being a ranged hero with a low base attack time, and your escape skill can save you from ganks if used properly. Once you have enough levels, you can use Powershot to get last-hits from a safe range and to harass down the enemy heroes enough to give yourself a chance at a kill.<br/>As a mid, Windranger should purchase an early Null Talisman for more last-hitting power, and save up for a Bottle to give her mana for her spells. Survivability is less of an issue as the enemy's supports will have to rotate in order to gank you, so priority should be given to beating the enemy's mid and leveling up your nukes and disables so that you have a chance to get a kill.<br/>As a safe-lane support, Windranger can focus on harassing down the enemy's off-laner using her ranged attacks, and landing full-duration Shackleshots during ganks. Priority here is given to protecting the safe-lane carry and shutting down the enemy off-laner, so nukes and disables take priority.<br/><h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Winter Wyvern is a powerful nuker who also provides utility in her spells, making her a well-rounded support. As she does not require gold in order to be effective, she is well-suited to playing as a hard support, protecting her safe lane carry and rotating to gank with her spells.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/><br/>Scales well into the late game<br/>Does not need items to do her job, and can focus on warding the map<br/>Is a decent pusher if you use your abilities right<br/><b>Cons</b><br/><br/>Falls off mid game when most damage is magic, but comes back online late game when physical carries start to come online<br/>Bad Winter's Curse usage can lose a winning team fight.<br/>Cold Embrace makes the ally unable to move, making them easy prey to magical nukers<br/>Bad movement speed<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3><br/>Unlike most other intelligence-based casting supports, Winter Wyvern possesses respectable strength growth, making her quite resistant to damage. However, her poor base agility also means that she has low base armor, and can benefit greatly from purchasing items that provide her with bonus armor.<br/>Winter Wyvern has an extremely high cast range for all of her spells, allowing her to impact ganks and teamfights from the back lines without endangering herself. Purchasing mobility items allows her to position herself for casting her spells more easily.<br/>Keep in mind, Winter Wyvern has poor base movement speed and a very slow turn rate, making her quite sluggish; as well, she has a very short attack range and slow projectile speed, as well as poor base damage, making her physical attacks quite ineffective at harassing when not boosted by Arctic Burn.
