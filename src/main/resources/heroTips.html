<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Abaddon is versatile hero who specializes in absorbing damage and shielding his teammates. Unlike
other supports, Abaddon's Borrowed Time allows him to be in the middle of the fight, converting heavy attacks back into
health. His Mist Coil Aphotic Shield makes it frustratingly hard for enemies to bring down his allies, and their low
cooldowns can turn fights around at crucial moments. Curse of Avernus slows foes hit by your sword, giving them a hard
time running from you and your allies (since you can hit them with no worries while your ultimate is off cooldown), at
the same time increasing your allies attack speed and movement speed if they also hit the enemy. Although Abaddon's
common build seldom allows him to do enough damage to kill enemies alone, he can still provide cheap nuke damage while
played as support, and under favorable circumstances, he can also be played as a semi-carry.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very
tanky support.<br/>Low cooldowns.<br/>Can fulfill multiple roles.<br/>Has a built-in dispel.<br/>Great support for
beginners.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mobility.<br/>Low starting armor.<br/>Long cast animations.<br/>Mana
dependent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Alchemist is a formidable carry capable of amassing large amounts of gold, and sustaining himself
almost indefinitely during teamfights. Armed with a Shadow Blade, Alchemist can also gank effectively by stunning
enemies with Unstable Concoction. Because of the extra gold from his Greevil's Greed, Alchemist will always snowball
into a potent fighter if a match goes long. Under Chemical Rage, a well-farmed Alchemist can demolish heroes and
structures alike with alarmingly fast attack speed, all the while regenerating his health at incredible rates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Scales
well into late game.<br/>Good comeback potential.<br/>Capable of farming gold quickly.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly
reliant on his ultimate.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Worst stat growth in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Axe is a very strong initiator and disabler as he possesses an area disable capable of piercing spell
immunity in Berserker's Call, and a low-cooldown slow in Battle Hunger that also boosts his movement speed. Given
mobility and mana sustain, Axe is capable of wreaking havoc against enemies at all points of the
game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful ganker once he gets his Blink Dagger.<br/>Very good at punishing melee heroes in
lane.<br/>Can farm lanes and the jungle very quickly.<br/>Almost completely unaffected by spell immunity.<br/>Very
resistant to physical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Damage output falls off in the late game.<br/>Can have a hard
time against ranged heroes in lane.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Countered by Nukers and Disablers.<br/>If Axe sees a group
of enemies, he should be very careful, as he needs to catch the entire group with his Berserker's Call, otherwise, the
less enemies caught in Axe's trap, the more chances of dying he gets.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Beastmaster is a utility hero that brings many benefits to his team, such as clearing trees with Wild
Axes. His scouting Hawk functions like a moving ward, and his Boar slows down enemies with ranged attacks. Inner Beast
speeds up allied attacks, and Primal Roar is the best single-target stun in the game. That said, Beastmaster does not
excel at any one particular role and is usually played as a semi-support or initiator. His summons require a modest
amount of micromanagement, which can be intimidating to new players. Beastmaster can pick off supports with ease, but
cannot go head-to-head against heavier heroes. Depending on the situation, players can build Beastmaster as an
initiator, pusher, or an armor/strength based brawler.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Large scouting vision with Hawk.<br/>Long
duration stun that goes through Spell Immunity.<br/>Good at Pushing.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low damage.<br/>No escape
mechanisms.<br/>Requires some micromanagement.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Brewmaster is an unpredictable brawler who sows disarray among enemy formations. With the help of a
Blink Dagger, he jumps in to initiate with Thunder Clap, then divides into three elemental beings with Primal Split. He
lands critical hits and dodges at random due to Drunken Brawler, dealing significant damage. Brewmaster is fairly tanky,
and difficult to kill when he splits apart with his ultimate. However, he does not excel at any one purpose, and should
be considered a hybrid between initiator, brawler, and tank.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High survivability with
ultimate.<br/>Numerous disables when in ultimate form.<br/>Counters carries.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Requires fast
micromanagement.<br/>No mobility skills.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Bristleback is a very good tank not only because of his formidable health pool, but also because of
one of his abilities Bristleback, making him more of a tank when fighting his back. Being a carry and a tank at the same
time, he can easily become team's initiator, capable of dealing and taking tons of health in a teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very
durable.<br/>Effective ganker early and mid game.<br/>Can chase down fleeing enemy easily.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has
mana issues in early and mid game.<br/>Not effective against high-armor heroes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Centaur Warrunner is an aggressive tank who excels when he is placed in the middle of fights. He
reflects damage with his passive ability Return, while stunning and attacking the area around him with Hoof Stomp and
Double Edge. Unlike other tanks, Centaur Warrunner sacrifices some durability in exchange for damage output, and may
have a hard time recovering if the early game does not go well.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky early game to late
game<br/>Can be useful to the team without large amounts of gold/items, but also benefits greatly from any gold he can
get.<br/>Can gank very effectively.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Countered by lifesteal.<br/>Low mana.<br/>Low damage in the
late game.<br/>Vulnerable to enemy abilities which remove a percentage of health or kill at a certain health
threshold.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Chaos Knight is a powerful strength hero dealing High Physical DPS that smashes his foes with
straight, but powerful hits due to his Chaos Strike. Chaos Bolt is a luck-base spell that makes it hard to use, and he
can close the gap with his enemies through Reality Rift. Phantasm has long recharge time, it would be recommended to
time your ultimate for teamfights only. Chaos Knight requires adequate farming and an aggressive mindset to trample
enemy Heroes. Once enough farming, he can overpower the late game with lots of Physical DPS with his
Illusions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Good movement speed.<br/>Great late game.<br/>Can be aggressive in early and mid
game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very RNG reliant.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Very tempting for enemy heroes.<br/>Highly
reliant on his ultimate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Clockwerk is a tanky initiator and ganker built to isolate and separate enemies. His array of disables
and nukes provide strong crowd control in any situation, allowing him to greatly disrupt the enemy. Rocket Flare
provides distant scouting vision, and Hookshot allows Clockwerk to initiate from extreme distances. He specializes in
trapping and zoning out enemies with Power Cogs, allowing him and his team to pick off single heroes. With Blade Mail,
his core item, Clockwerk reflects damage and forces enemies to risk their lives by attacking him, or entering deeper
into his team formation to find different targets. His abilities require good positioning and aim, which can be daunting
for newer players. Clockwerk's damage scales badly into the late game, where his purpose will be limited to
initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky, super long range initiator.<br/>Powerful area control.<br/>Effective ganker.<br/>Good
scouting vision.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low damage in the late game.<br/>Requires good aim.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Doom is a versatile carry who can become a powerful late-game threat due to his ability to quickly
farm with Devour, his strong nuking power, and his ultimate Doom that lets him disable an enemy for at least 15 seconds.
His skill set and fast farming potential allows him to be built in any number of ways to meet the enemy
threat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Doom's ultimate is one of the strongest single target disables in the game.<br/>Devour
boosts gold income and grants Doom access to jungle creep abilities.<br/>High base STR and high STR growth gives Doom
naturally high HP and base damage.<br/>Potent scaling damage-over-time debuff from Infernal Blade.<br/>Versatile hero
that can be built in a variety of different ways, as either a support or core.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable to
ranged heroes<br/>Very vulnerable to slows<br/>Low starting base armor<br/>Little to no armor increase through
stats<br/>Has low intelligence<br/>Has low base agility and low agility gain<br/>Has a 2.0 BAT (the lowest in the game),
with low agility (base and gain), making the use of his nuke very unreliable<br/>Nuke is considered a normal
right-click, meaning it can miss if the opponent hero has evasion.<br/>Can't properly tank without his 2nd skill<br/>Any
other proper tank can be a better aura carry, if they get equal or more farm than Doom<br/>Vulnerable to early
harassment<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Dragon Knight is a durable front-line carry who can transform into a dragon and wipe out enemies with
ranged projectile attacks. His heavy armor and regeneration from Dragon Blood makes him tankier than most carries,
especially in the early game. If his team gains the upper hand, Dragon Knight's presence often ensures continued
domination with little chance of enemy comeback. With a Shadow Blade, Dragon Knight can make a decent ganker due to
Dragon Tail and its long stun duration. While resilient, Dragon Knight's damage output depends heavily on his dragon
form, and can be rather useless if caught while it's on cooldown. Dragon Knight is also quite slow, and has no mobility
skills.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Heavy armor against physical attacks.<br/>High health regeneration.<br/>Instant cast
animations.<br/>Strong splash damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow movement speed.<br/>Very dependent on his
ultimate.<br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Earth Spirit is one of the strongest disabling heroes in the game, possessing a stun, silence and slow
in all of his basic abilities, allowing him to combo his abilities based on the needs of his allies and how he wants to
affect his enemies. By judiciously using his spells at the right time and in the right situation, he can inflict the
enemy with powerful crowd control effects.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very dangerous roaming presence.<br/>Performs role
well without items.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Requires precise positioning and timing.<br/>Mediocre lane presence if not
playing aggressively.<br/>Somewhat level dependent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Earthshaker is a powerful spellcaster designed to repeatedly stun enemies. However, his naturally low
mana requires careful management and selective use, especially during the early game. His Echo Slam allows him to wipe
out large groups of enemies, making him an ideal pick against heroes like Chaos Knight, Meepo, Broodmother, or Phantom
Lancer. Compared to intelligence supports, Earthshaker has a sizeable health pool. But compared to most strength heroes,
Earthshaker is fairly vulnerable and can be easily killed if caught out of position.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Numerous
stuns.<br/>Excellent initiation.<br/>Good early ganking.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/>Long cast
animations.<br/>Easy to harass in lane.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Elder Titan is a very flexible hero who can provide great amounts of utility to his team through his
abilities, depending on how he is built. He can use Astral Spirit to accrue great amounts of bonus damage and movement
speed, and then take advantage of Natural Order to inflict that bonus damage on enemies when their defenses are reduced.
He is also capable of disabling multiple enemy heroes at once with a combination of Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp, as
well as set up strong slows and deal tremendous damage with Earth Splitter after landing a successful Echo
Stomp.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Wide area disable.<br/>Anti-tank aura.<br/>Can deal high physical damage as a
support.<br/>Good scouting ability.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Mediocre stat growths.<br/>Difficult to land spells.<br/>Low
mana.<br/>Requires some micro-management.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Huskar is a resilient ranged attacker who sacrifices his own health to inflict greater damage. An
injured Huskar attacks with incredible speed, making him frustratingly hard to kill even at the brink of death. His
deadly Life Break is supremely suited to killing enemies one-on-one, especially during the early to mid game. Huskar's
natural magic resistance prevents enemies from nuking him down while he finishes the job, then heals himself with Inner
Vitality. He fulfills the roles of carry and ganker, although the damage over time from Burning Spears will not match
heavier carries in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very resilient.<br/>Requires no mana management.<br/>Can turn
fights around even at low health.<br/>Excellent early to mid game presence.<br/>Counters heavy magical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Many
counters.<br/>No disables.<br/>Low armor.<br/>Needs Regeneration items to Survive.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Io is a unique hero that provides boosts to its allies by linking to them. While relatively powerless
alone, Io can be extremely useful when paired with the appropriate heroes. It regenerates allies through Tether, and
buffs their defense and attack speed with Overcharge. But most importantly, Io can Relocate an ally to any point on the
map, setting up perfect ganks or saving that ally from certain death.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not item dependent.<br/>Global
mobility.<br/>Grealty increases one's durability.<br/>Low mana costs.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dies very easily.<br/>Requires
precise coordination with teammates.<br/>Useless alone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Kunkka is a strategic fighter that relies on his carefully placed abilities to disrupt enemy
formations. His skills complement one another, and need to be used in conjunction to be effective. With his Tidebringer,
Kunkka can deal a good amount of damage to a large area in front of him. Playing Kunkka requires good timing, tactical
thinking, and an understanding of enemy movement. If insufficiently farmed, however, Kunkka will barely do any damage,
and must rely on landing his abilities if he is to remain useful to his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Large, disruptive
AoE abilities with massive damage.<br/>Wide reach and crowd physical damage with Tidebringer.<br/>X Marks the Spot is a
unique single target control ability.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>A hated target in teamfights and may be focused at first.<br/>Requires
good timing to land ability combos.<br/>Ability damage falls off in the late game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Legion Commander is ganking carry whose damage potential is theoretically unlimited. She is able to
heal, buff herself and her allies with Press the Attack, and finish off enemies with Overwhelming Odds. With each
victorious Duel, the Legion Commander becomes even more unstoppable. However, if she fails to win regular Duels, her
damage may suffer as a result, rendering her much less useful as the game goes on.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Excellent
snowballing potential.<br/>Tanky during laning phase.<br/>Prevent enemy from escaping.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent
on winning Duels.<br/>High mana cost during laning phase.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Lifestealer is a voracious flesh-eater who Feasts on his prey to regain his health, after inflicting
them with deadly Open Wounds. Consumed by madness, he will go through vicious Rages that will grant him magic immunity
and bonus attack speed. If he's especially hungry and desperate, he can Infest any creep and hide inside like a
parasite, devouring him when he's finally released.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Built-in magic immunity (and some attack
speed too).<br/>A great anti-tank.<br/>Pairs nicely with any mobile initiator.<br/>Infest can be great to use in the
middle of a fight to heal you back up....<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>His only disable is a slow (granted, a decent
one).<br/>His ultimate can be a little underwhelming, especially in the late game.<br/>Almost no AOE.<br/>.... IF (and
only if) there's a nearby creep with lots of hp remaining.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Lycan is a remarkable pusher and split-pusher that can wear down the enemies and force them to react
quickly to his regular tower onslaughts; as towers melt incredibly fast under his and his minions' pressure, boosted by
their canine Feral Impulse. His only contribution to full-on team fights will be the bonus damage he grants with Howl to
his allies, his allies' summons, his owns summons and himself... And his formidable right-click power. Else he can surge
out of the woods for a quick gank or push after he transformed with Shapeshift, moving at a speed of 650. Finally, good
players will make the best usage of his Summon Wolves ability and scout the enemies' position while remaining undetected
since they're invisible when maxed out.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great jungler.<br/>Can take out Roshan by himself.<br/>Terrific
pusher.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can require some help in the laning stage.<br/>Reliant on BKB for protection.<br/>No
reliable disables.<br/>Little team fight contribution.<br/>Needs correct micro-management and decision-making to get the
most out of him.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Magnus is one of the few melee heroes who can solo the middle lane well, because of his skill set.
Shockwave allows him to safely get last hits while also harassing the lane opponent. His ultimate, Reverse Polarity, is
an extremely important ability for teamfights, allowing him to stun and group up enemies hit into a small area in front
of him, which can then be moved through Skewer. It is ideal for him especially if he is needed to be a carry in the late
game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great teamfighter thanks to Reverse Polarity and Skewer.<br/>Can be played as
right-clicker.<br/>Compliments the team's late-game carry.<br/>Good hero to pick off with.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Only
useful in the late-game because of Reverse Polarity.<br/>Has mana problems because of high-mana cost spells and spamming
Shockwave.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Night Stalker is a strong early game ganker during the night. Night Stalker depends greatly on
darkness in order to be effective as his abilities greatly increase in strength during the night. If left unchecked,
Night Stalker can snowball by getting kills after kills in the early game and controlling the map in the mid-later
stages of the game with superior night vision. Night Stalker is not a strong team fighter and should be using superior
vision and map control to dictate when and where team fights should occur.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Superior night
vision allows Night Stalker to control the map and scout effectively to jump on an unsuspecting lone hero or retreat
safely from a scouted gank.<br/>Bulky<br/>High night presence, allowing to shut down individual targets with a
semispammable slow, miss chance and silence debuff and chase them down with superior move speed.<br/>Great for hit and
run gank tactics<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Weak in team fights due to the lack of strong area of effect spells and
ultimate<br/>Weak during day time, forced to play around night time.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Poor lane phase.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Omniknight is a defensive support who specializes in healing his allies with Purification and
shielding them from damage with Repel and Guardian Angel. Unlike most other supports, he remains relevant in the late
game as his abilities lack the type of scaling that makes them irrelevant against farmed enemies. Omniknight is
generally played as a safe-lane support, but he can occasionally be played as an off-laner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely
powerful defensive abilities.<br/>Relatively tanky support.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Constant mana problems.<br/>Very
vulnerable to silence.<br/>Abilities can be purged.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Phoenix is a risk-reward, spell-dependent supportive initiator adept at placing debuffs on a wide area
to hamper the enemy team's offensive capabilities and slowly burn their health away. Its abilities let it apply powerful
slows, rain down heavy damage over time from a distance, and then cover a large area in a stellar inferno as it
collapses into a scorching Supernova. Should enemies fail to destroy or escape it, they will be met with a spell
immunity-piercing stun, allowing Phoenix and its allies to take advantage of the enemy and follow up with their other
abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Long range on all of its abilities.<br/>Counters auto-attack dependent carries.<br/>Scaling
magical damage along with healing.<br/>Capable of inflicting many debuffs on multiple enemies at once.<br/>Deceptively
elusive and durable with the right order of spell usage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No true disables.<br/>Has almost no
spell immunity piercing effects.<br/>Very ability and mana dependent.<br/>Requires precise and careful positioning, aim
and timing.<br/>Low armor and has health costs along with mana costs on most abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Pudge is a fearsome ganker and one of the most renowned heroes in all of Dota. Played skillfully, he
can dis-position enemies and set up kills for his team that would be otherwise impossible to accomplish.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has
a respectable health pool early game that grows even bigger later on.<br/>Very good ganker and roamer in the early game.<br/>One
of the best tanks in the game, capable of being resistant to both magic and physical damage in late part of the
game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low armor at the early stages of the game.<br/>Sometimes he's very dependent on his
teammates.<br/>Requires skills to land a normal hook, if playing as initiator-tank, a fail hook that supposed to
initiate the battle could ruin the whole team fight<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Sand King is an Initiator, escaper, and a carry if you have enough gold to do so.He suffers from low
initial damage but compensates with his semi-nuke passive (An attack modifier).<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Stuns that can
be used as both, initiation and escape<br/>Provides a good AoE in the game which is devastating early-game<br/>Great in
laning phases with his passive<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has little health pool that can be taken advantage of by
nukes<br/>Ultimate scales poorly into late game<br/>Low mana pool makes spellcasting in early game
difficult<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Slardar is a physical damage-based carry who specializes in chasing down and crushing his foes. While
he is very straightforward and easy to learn, mastering his abilities can allow players to unlock his true
potential.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High Physical Damage<br/>Powerful Carry potential<br/>High Armor and fast attack
speed<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Sluggish Mobility<br/>Quite item dependent<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Spirit Breaker usually serve as an initiator/ganker/tanker role in the team. His skillset
allows/requires player to consistently checking for any ganking opportunity across the map meanwhile helping his team
secure space and farm. If he does so, a successful early-mid game Barathrum can snowball into a semi-carry and crush his
foes relentlessly, carving a path to victory for his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great ganker thanks to global
initiation and durability<br/>Can stunlock a target for a long period of time<br/>Can solo-kill fragile heroes after
charging at them from anywhere<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very poor teamfight contribution<br/>Unreliable Bash, mainly due
to slow attack speed<br/>Heavily countered by decent vision on the map and sticking together<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Sven is the embodiment of strength, a mighty front line fighter capable of dealing tremendous physical
damage to groups of foes at once. A well farmed Sven can destroy an enemy in just a few hits, overpowering other carries
with sheer burst damage. However, Sven is vulnerable to kiting and disables, and generally has a slower attack speed
than most carries.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high melee damage.<br/>Good at clearing groups.<br/>Reliable AoE
stun.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/>Low attack speed.<br/>Highly dependent on Black King
Bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Tidehunter is a very durable hero who brings disables and debuffs to the field. He focuses on
debilitating the enemy and shrugging off their attempts to disable and kill him, as he is capable of absorbing a
tremendous amount of punishment should the enemy attempt to focus him down to prevent him from inhibiting them in
teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>(One of) the best team fight ultimate in the game.<br/>His durability gives you a
chance to survive your own mistakes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Not a huge damage output.<br/>Quite mana-dependent in the
early game.<br/>Kraken Shell doesn't purge everything.<br/>Better opponents will know when they've got an actual shot at
killing you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Timbersaw is an armored brawler who relies on cutting down trees as a mechanic for rapid movement and
dealing damage. In the early and mid stages of the game, Timbersaw can be surprisingly durable, staying in the fight and
taking out multiple opponents even on the verge of death. His pure damage penetrates armor and magic resistance, making
him deadly against all opponents. However, Timbersaw lacks any true disables, and must rely on his mobility to keep up
with his enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Highly mobile.<br/>High armor.<br/>High HP regeneration<br/>Deals pure
damage.<br/>High mana capacity.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No disables.<br/>Entirely dependent on abilities to deal
damage.<br/>Low HP.<br/>Very dependent on Bloodstone<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Tiny is a heavy carry with a large amount of health. He is the only hero in the game that grows as he
levels up. In the early game, he uses his Avalanche > Toss combo to gank and deal burst damage. As he acquires more
items, Tiny transitions into a full-fledged carry, capable of wiping entire teams with his tree, and demolishing
buildings in very little time. With a Blink Dagger, Tiny also makes an effective initiator. However, Tiny is susceptible
to disables, and can be shut down by intense harassment in the early game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High early game
burst damage.<br/>High late game AoE damage.<br/>Passive counters melee carries.<br/>High damage against buildings.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low
mana.<br/>Needs a good early game.<br/>Very bad starting armor and agility growth<br/>Low attack speed without
items<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Treant Protector is a tough support hero who is able to protect and regenerate allies and friendly
buildings with his trademark ability, Living Armor. Hiding himself with Nature's Guise and packing a huge bash, he is
one of few supports that can sneak past enemy lines to set up ganks and/or initiate a fight by trapping the opposing
team in an Overgrowth. Alone, Treant Protector does little damage and requires good teamwork to be
effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global range with Living Armor.<br/>Fairly tanky.<br/>Can heal buildings.<br/>Highest
base physical damage in the game at Lvl 1.<br/>AoE Magic Immunity piercing root and disarm.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily
countered by vision and true sight.<br/>Very dependent on teammates.<br/>Little offensive power (due to high defensive
power).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Tusk is a very strong initiator who can set up fights on his team's terms. His arsenal of crowd
control spells can greatly inhibit enemies during fights and ganks, giving allies a powerful edge. Tusk is a ganking
specialist as he can hunt fragile heroes throughout the game. However, his skill and aggressive play style can be a
double edge against him when it comes to initiating & chasing fleeing enemies as his ice shard can block his teammates
from proceed with the chase and he can roll himself into a counter-ganking trap set up by his opponent. Thus, although
his skillset is rather straightforward, player should exercise good judgement before consider initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Quite
versatile in role.<br/>Powerful disable abilities, especially his ultimate.<br/>High Movement Speed without Boots.<br/>Specialize
in ganking.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Quite weak without Desolator or Shadow Blade<br/>Even though he is a strength hero,
he has low health<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Underlord is a durable support who takes charge on the battlefield, creating dangerous hazards over
large areas, while teleporting his team across the map with Dark Rift. He excels at trapping enemies in a Pit of Malice,
and blunting physical damage inside his Atrophy Aura. With the health of a strength hero and the extra damage from
Atrophy Aura, Underlord can stand his ground better than most supports. However, Underlord is slow and lumbering, and
often suffers from insufficient mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Excellent zoning abilities.<br/>Tankier than most
supports.<br/>Reduces enemy damage.<br/>Strong potential for sudden pushes.<br/>Not item dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low
mana.<br/>Damage scales poorly into the late game.<br/>Requires good team coordination.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Undying usually serve as a lane support/tanker role in the team. His skillset allows player to harass
enemy off the lane meanwhile helping his carry to secure space to farm. Dirge truly shines during every coordinated
teamfight due to his plague aura and tombstone, forcing his enemy to either kill him or suffer the debuff
consequences.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong harassing ability<br/>Formidable team fight presence<br/>Can play
extremely aggressively in the early game<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Relies on items and Decay stacks for durability due to
mediocre Strength gain and abysmal Agility gain.<br/>Pathetic scaling into the late game unless incredibly farmed.<br/>No
hard disables, needs to be relatively close to enemies in order to contribute to fights.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Wraith King is a durable carry with a reliable stun. As his ultimate, Reincarnation, effectively
doubles his health in a teamfight, he is commonly built as a tank carry. He is traditionally popular among new players
for his survivability and potentially simple playstyle. However, Wraith King can also be played at a high level of
skill, particularly by using active items.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great durability<br/>High Survivability<br/>Reliable
Stun<br/>Rather easy to learn<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana pool<br/>Slow attack speed and movement speed<br/>Low
armor in early to mid game<br/>Mostly countered by heroes who can mana burn<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Anti-Mage is one of the most mobile carries in the game, mostly well known for his ability to punish
lineups heavily reliant on magic damage with Spell Shield giving him very high magic resistance and his Mana Void can be
used to cause massive damage to heroes with huge mana pools. His Blink makes him one of the fastest farmers in the game,
with the ability to jump from creep camp to creep camp and quickly clear them with few items. Anti-Mage is however
incredibly reliant on items to unlock his true potential, having a very low strength gain and no way of locking down
enemy heroes makes him a very vulnerable hero if he does not have enough farm.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely mobile
and hard to catch.<br/>High attack speed.<br/>Scales well into late game.<br/>Punishes heroes who rely on
mana.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low Strength and Intelligence gain.<br/>Reliant on Battle Fury to farm<br/>Very reliant
on farm to scale.<br/>Needs a decent support in lane to get good farm.<br/>Can be shut down in the early game.<br/>Weak
against gankers that disable if overextended.<br/>Countered by heroes who aren't 100% dependent to mana, such as
Huskar<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Arc Warden is a carry that can nuke enemies early and then split push to end the game. His health,
armor, and mana early on are fairly low, but they still give him enough to last in lane and nuke foes with his combo.
His health and mana grow to respectable degrees later on, but his agility still suffers. His biggest detriments
throughout the game are no mobility skills, needing to micromanage, and his abilities suffering vs multiple heroes.
Nonetheless, a Warden who gets farmed is a foe to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Highest base strength and
Intelligence of all agility heroes, and highest Intelligence growth.<br/>Can easily nuke most enemies 1v1<br/>Split
Pushes extremely well with Tempest Double<br/>One of the most versatile heroes in the game<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Second
lowest base agility and agility gain of all agility heroes<br/>0.1 base armor makes him susceptible to physical
harassment early on.<br/>Slow movement speed with no mobility skills makes it hard for him to escape if ganked.<br/>Needs
items to farm quickly, no ability outside of his ult helps him with farming.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Bloodseeker is a snowballing carry who grows faster and stronger as his enemies get weaker. Like a
shark in water, Bloodseeker detects injured enemies across the entire map and runs them down with unnatural speed
through Thirst. His Rupture makes enemies bleed with every step, allowing him to gank targets with ease during the early
game. Regaining health each time an enemy falls, Bloodseeker overwhelms enemy teams in fights, leaving little chance for
turnarounds. However, Bloodseeker has no disables of his own, and must rely on his teammates to lock down
targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Fast movement speed.<br/>Regains health by killing enemies.<br/>Good early
ganker.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no disables.<br/>Vulnerable to enemy disables.<br/>Countered by
tanks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Bounty Hunter is a strong utility support hero who helps his team by picking off the enemy one by one,
increasing gold gain for his team and giving them opportunities to take map objectives while they outnumber the enemy.
However, he is also very vulnerable since his low strength means that he can be easily killed if the enemy catches him
while he approaches a target, particularly due to his reliance on Shadow Walk. As such, good judgment and map awareness
are key when playing Bounty Hunter, as he must be able to successfully initiate on and kill his targets without the
enemy retaliating.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage.<br/>Invisibility.<br/>Can counter other invisible heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very
squishy.<br/>Mana-dependent.<br/>Weak team fight presence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Broodmother is hero made to pressure the lanes early. While she excels at split-pushing the lanes and
taking towers with her army of spiderlings, she cannot carry the game by herself and normally needs to coordinate with
her team to finish the game in a timely manner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong split-pusher.<br/>Very strong kill
potential early game.<br/>Can farm enemy jungle.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Predictable play style due to lack of global
presence.<br/>Damage scales off late game.<br/>Often forces own team to play 4 vs 5.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Clinkz is a great all around ranged carry with high offensive burst damage. Though frail and easy to
kill, Skeleton Walk grants Clinkz stealth and haste to escape and re-position himself. This skill is also what makes
Clinkz such an incredible ganker. His Searing Arrows provide huge bonus damage, greatly injuring enemies in conjunction
with Strafe. Despite his high damage, Clinkz has no disabling abilities, and has difficulty killing enemies once they
move out of range.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Invisible ganker.<br/>Very high attack damage.<br/>Destroys buildings
quickly.<br/>High movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very fragile.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Slow attack
animation.<br/>Easily countered by true sight.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Drow Ranger is a deadly archer, chilling and killing her enemies with volleys of Frost Arrows. With
one of the highest agility stats in the game, her powerful shots will tear through most enemies from a safe distance.
Her Precision Aura increases the damage of her ranged allies, and a timely Gust can silence groups of enemies at pivotal
moments. Drow Ranger is fairly fragile with no real escape ability, causing her to struggle against faster and more
aggressive melee heroes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High single target damage.<br/>Powerful early pusher.<br/>Good chaser.<br/>Buffs
other ranged heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly stat dependent.<br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Fragile and easily
ganked.<br/>Slow attack animation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Ember Spirit is a very mobile and evasive carry due to his ability to strike from range or dodge enemy
attacks using Sleight of Fist and Fire Remnants. Playing Ember Spirit requires quick reflexes, good judgment and an
aggressive mindset, as his instant cast animations and high mobility allow skilled players to outplay and outwit
opponents, darting around the map to be where they least expect.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great mobility, hard to kill
in teamfights.<br/>Global-wide presence, Strong pushing skillset.<br/>Deals AOE physical damage that scales into late
game.<br/>Large magical damage in early to mid game.<br/>Absorbs moderate amount of magical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low
agility growth.<br/>Weak manfight capability.<br/>Vulnerable to silences and chain stuns.<br/>High requirement for good
positioning and reflexes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Faceless Void is a hero who holds mastery over time. He dashes through the battlefield, rewinding
damage with Time Walk, stuns enemies with Time Lock, and causes their abilities to recharge slower with Time Dilation.
His signature ability, Chronosphere, creates a bubble in space-time, stopping everything caught within so he and his
team can beat down the enemy without retribution. As a melee carry, Faceless Void requires a large amount of farm in
order to deal decent damage, but can be devastatingly powerful once he has his items. Faceless Void can be played solo
in the off-lane, or with a support in the safe lane.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Fulfills both carry and initiator
roles.<br/>Low cooldown escape ability.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item and farm dependent.<br/>No room for mistakes with
his ultimate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Gyrocopter is a ranged carry who specializes at dishing out physical and magical damage over a wide
area. He presents an unorthodox pattern of carry in that he can deal a large amount of magical damage and crowd control
much earlier than other carry heroes thanks to Call Down and Rocket Barrage. As game goes on, Flak Cannon adds up his
physical damage output and maintains his threat to entire enemy team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals wide area
damage.<br/>High early game damage compared to most carries.<br/>Fast farmer.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Relatively
fragile.<br/>Shorter attack range than other ranged carries.<br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Juggernaut is a formidable swordsman capable of engaging and cutting down single enemies without much
risk to himself. A medium carry, Juggernaut can support his teammates with Healing Ward, and escape dangerous situations
with Blade Fury. In a one-on-one fight, Juggernaut's Omnislash is the most powerful single target ability in the game,
usually killing his opponent if no other enemies are around to absorb the damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High single
target damage.<br/>Strong mid game presence.<br/>Can play aggressively in lane.<br/>Farms
quickly.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Weak against multiple targets.<br/>Falls off against hard carries in the late
game.<br/>Somewhat fragile.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Lone Druid is an adaptive carry who controls a durable Spirit Bear to wreak havoc on the battlefield.
With two separate item inventories, the pair acts like two complimentary heroes that can be played a number of ways:
with Lone Druid providing buffs from the back while the Spirit Bear fights on the front lines, or with Lone Druid
attacking from long range while the Spirit Bear scouts and split pushes. This arrangement allows the Lone Druid to stay
on the fringes of conflict, thus risking his own life less than most other carries. However, if the Spirit Bear falls in
battle, the Lone Druid himself becomes significantly less effective. Because of the micro-management needed to control
the Spirit Bear, Lone Druid can be a daunting hero for newer players.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Faster pusher and
building destroyer.<br/>Strong at early-mid game fights.<br/>Scales well into the late game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Few
realistic options for increasing Spirit Bear's durability.<br/>Requires a moderate amount of micro skill.<br/>Often
highly dependent on his Spirit Bear.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Luna is a highly offensive carry who can demolish buildings and clear the battlefield in very little
time. Along with her flying Moon Glaives, Luna can call upon the goddess Selemene to cover the battlefield in an
Eclipse, striking down large numbers of enemies at once. Being a purely offensive hero, Luna suffers from a lack of
defensive abilities, and will struggle against carries that are geared towards one-on-one
combat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Hits multiple targets at once.<br/>Fast pusher and farmer.<br/>Good night vision.<br/>High
magical damage output during the early game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/>No defense
mechanisms.<br/>Short attack range.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Easily kited by high-mobility
heroes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Medusa is a very hard carry who can easily turn teamfights around in her favor. Her Mana Shield makes
her one of the tankiest carries in the game, but her extreme item dependence requires her to farm for much of the game
before she can be effective in teamfights. Split Shot allows her to farm really fast in the jungle and deal considerable
damage to multiple heroes in fights. However, her early game is filled with problems, such as having the lowest base HP
in the game, very little mana, and slow movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very powerful in late game.<br/>Effective
against multiple opponents.<br/>Great crowd control.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow movement speed<br/>Very fragile in
early game.<br/>Extremely item dependent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Meepo is one of the most unique heroes in all of Dota, with the ability to split into up to five
bodies. While he requires intensive micro-management, once mastered Meepo is capable of farming, pushing and ganking
(maybe all at once) more successfully than most other heroes in the game. Earthbind allows Meepo to trap an enemy for an
extended period of time, as all of Meepo's clones share individual cooldowns on abilities. Poof allows his clones to
teleport to other clones, including the original Meepo, while also doing considerable amounts of damage, especially when
several Meepos use it at the same time.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has up to 5 independent bodies.<br/>Very fast
farmer.<br/>Sheer numbers overwhelms enemies.<br/>Can disable enemies repeatedly.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very
vulnerable against area nuke abilities.<br/>Very micro-intensive.<br/>Very hard to play.<br/>Requires lots of farm to be
effective.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Mirana is a very well-rounded hero who can fill almost any role required by her team. Her array of
spells gives her the ability to disable, nuke, push, escape and gank in any number of situations. The teamwide
invisibility from her Moonlight Shadow is one of the best ganking tools in the game. Depending on the lineup, Mirana is
capable of playing as a carry, semi-carry, roamer, support, and even has minor jungling
capabilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very long range stun.<br/>Team invisibility.<br/>Good escape mechanism.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Does
not excel at any one role.<br/>Requires good aim.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Monkey King is a trickster hero who jumps from treetop to treetop, scouting out his opponents from
above, waiting for the opportunity to crash down on them with Primal Spring. With his magic extending staff, he smashes
distant foes with Boundless Strikes, each blow charging his weapon through Jingu Mastery. Prone to Mischief, the Monkey
King disguises himself as trees and everyday objects, allowing him to ambush enemies, or deceive them for a quick
getaway.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tricky and elusive.<br/>Very mobile.<br/>Reliable damage.<br/>Long melee attack range.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly
dependent on trees.<br/>Suffers long stun if he falls from a tree.<br/>Vulnerable to stuns.<br/>Requires consecutive
hits to benefit from passive bonus.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Morphling is a carry hero who switches between damage dealer and resilient survivor. With an Ethereal
Blade, Morphling can deal extremely high burst damage, often taking out an enemy instantly. However, he suffers from
item and level dependency, as well as a low mana pool and low movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can easily switch
between dealing a ton of damage or having a high HP pool.<br/>Can one shot most heroes in the game with Ethereal
Blade.<br/>Has an escape ability with a huge range..<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Short attack range.<br/>Low mana.<br/>One
of the slowest heroes in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Naga Siren is a versatile hero who can appear to be a team's hard carry while actually being just a
support. As a support, you can pin down an enemy with your bkb-piercing Ensnare, reduce his armor with Rip Tide and hit
him without putting yourself in danger with Mirror Image. And you have a fearsome teamfight ultimate with your dreamy
Song of the Siren which will put your enemies to sleep. As a carry however, you will use your images and Rip Tide to
farm the jungle and push the lanes, and your Song as a get-out-of-jail-free card, eventually crushing the enemy's base
under the ocean's pressure.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Role versatility.<br/>Good at split-pushing and wave cutting.<br/>Ultimate
allows team to reset fights.<br/>Good carrier for Gem of True Sight.<br/>Low cooldown root that pierces spell
immunity.<br/>Probably the fastest farmer in the game once you've acquired a Radiance.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Somewhat
farm dependent even if played as a support.<br/>Extremely farm dependent if played as a carry.<br/>Easy to misuse
ultimate with poor communication.<br/>Requires some basic micro-management skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Nyx Assassin is a powerful roamer whose burst damage nukes allows him to quickly kill any lone heroes
he encounters. While his spells provide relatively little teamfight contribution outside of Impale, his ability to kill
the enemy one by one can put the enemy team at a disadvantage in terms of economy, creating opportunities for his team
to take advantageous teamfights or outfarm the opposition. However, Nyx Assassin's abilities fall off in the late game,
where he plays a more supporting role with his stuns.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage.<br/>Reflects
damage.<br/>Can give a big space advantage to his team by ganking the enemy team in the early to mid game.<br/>High
health regeneration.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Less effective in the late game.<br/>Low mana.<br/>More information
needed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Assassin is a carry renowned for her innate chance to deal massive critical damage, often
killing enemies with a single swing. She specializes in hunting down vulnerable heroes, slowing them with a Stifling
Dagger and leaping past defenses with Phantom Strike. Like other carries, Phantom Assassin needs a decent amount of gold
and items to be effective. Because of her complete dependence on landing physical crits, she is susceptible to disables
and must rely on a Black King Bar in most teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high burst damage.<br/>Has natural
evasion.<br/>Has a cheap, long-range slow with good damage.<br/>Fairly mobile.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on
pseudo-random distribution.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Highly dependent on Black King Bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Lancer is an exceptional carry who outnumbers and overwhelms his targets with armies of
illusions. With the ability to charge at his opponents, the Phantom Lancer is relatively mobile, and can disappear
briefly from the battlefield to confuse or avoid his enemies. Indistinguishable from with his clones, enemies often have
a hard time targeting the real Phantom Lancer during fights. However, the Phantom Lancer's illusions can be destroyed by
area of effect abilities, rendering him less effective as a result.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Creates confusion with
large numbers of illusions.<br/>Excellent disjoint and dispel mechanism with Doppelganger.<br/>Good chase potential with
Phantom Rush.<br/>Fast, clean attack animation.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on illusions.<br/>Weak against AoE
abilities.<br/>Low health.<br/>No burst damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Razor is a fast, tough anti-carry who steals the attack power from his enemies, and transfers it to
himself. Armed with a Desolator, he can quickly melt away armor with Eye of the Storm, allowing his team to cut through
enemies with ease. However, Razor has no disables, and must rely on staying close to his targets and executing his
abilities properly in order to be an effective damage dealer.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Counters carries.<br/>Strong lane
presence.<br/>Good starting Strength and Agility.<br/>Fast movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on
well-positioned abilities to deal damage.<br/>Loses effectiveness against heroes with higher mobility.<br/>Does not
recover well from a bad early game.<br/>No disables.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Riki's permanent invisibility is both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. On one hand, it
makes him able to surprise enemies and farm with very little concern. On the other hand, without invisibility he has no
real defense. He still has to watch out for revealing items such as Dust of Appearance and Gem of True Sight, as well as
abilities that prevent him from going invisible. If he stays alive and picks off lone enemies, he can quickly get out of
control.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Permanent invisibility.<br/>Can use items without breaking invisibility.<br/>Relatively
mobile.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health points.<br/>Low health regeneration<br/>Low mana.<br/>Low base damage<br/>Easily
countered by wards and True Sight.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Fiend is a ranged carry who collects the soul of every unit he kills, growing stronger with
each soul claimed. Because of this, he benefits from a high attack damage potential, but also suffer punishing setbacks
if he dies. The Shadow Fiend can also unleash all the souls he has gathered, devastating enemies over a wide area with
Requiem of Souls. While highly effective as an offensive hero, Shadow Fiend has no defensive abilities and needs help
from teammates to position his abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Gains damage from kills.<br/>Fast farmer.<br/>Good
balance of early game magic damage and late game physical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Loses damage upon dying.<br/>No
escape mechanism.<br/>Requires good positioning.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Slark is an extremely slipperly melee carry. Jumping over obstacles, he Pounces on enemies and jumps
away to safety, shrouding himself from damage with Shadow Dance. When unseen, Slark's natural regeneration replenishes
his health, allowing him to return to the fight time and time again. Slark is susceptible to area disables and magical
nukes, and his damage is mostly effective against single targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Numerous escape
mechanisms.<br/>Steals enemy attributes.<br/>Large night vision.<br/>Strong pick-off and snowball
potential.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Fragile in the early game.<br/>Low attribute growth.<br/>Primarily single target
focused.<br/>Has no stuns.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Sniper is a very long ranged carry, designed to decimate enemies from the backline. He is able to
scout ahead with his Shrapnel, and pick off targets from extreme distances with Assassinate. In the late game, a
well-farmed Sniper can destroy almost any enemy before they have a chance to get close or do much in a teamfight.
However, Sniper is also one of the most defenseless heroes in the game, and can be easily killed if caught
alone.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high attack range.<br/>High single target damage.<br/>Excellent harassment
abilities.<br/>Easy for beginners.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Low mobility.<br/>Fragile and
easily ganked.<br/>Requires a good early game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Spectre is a hard carry who can dominate the late game if she gets the necessary farm. Her Desolate
ability lets her take on solo opponents with the upper hand, and Dispersion makes her a tanky foe who deals damage by
reflecting incoming attacks. However, her early game is one of the worst in the game, being squishy and her only escape
using up a lot of her mana pool. Get past this, however, and Spectre will be a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global
map presence.<br/>Extremely strong late game.<br/>Can gank well early game.<br/>Fairly tanky carry.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low
early game health and mana.<br/>Farms really slow without Radiance.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Low agility gain for an
agility hero.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Templar Assassin is a highly elusive and devastating hero in the right hands. Her Refraction
simultaneously protects her from any damage instance, no matter how low or high, and increases her attack damage output
for a few attacks. Combined with the armor reduction of Meld, any enemy hero with small health pools should be wary of
her, as if they are not vigilant, they will be crippled by her Psionic Traps, letting her catch up, or materialize
herself beside them with the help of a Blink Dagger, then finish them off in only a few swings of her Psi Blades. With
proper timing and the right tools, Lanaya can protect herself from powerful nukes, evade the enemy team, and even have
the potential to wipe out an entire team with perfect positioning and quick actions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Capable of
shredding armor and dealing massive amounts of physical damage.<br/>Can be very elusive.<br/>Provides some free vision
for team.<br/>Can efficiently farm Ancient stacks.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very vulnerable to damage over time
abilities.<br/>Meld by itself is not a reliable escape mechanism.<br/>Rather dependent on good positioning to make most
use of Psi Blades' spill AoE.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Terrorblade is a potent carry who demolishes buildings and heroes alike with his illusions. With
Metamorphosis, he transforms into an imposing demon avatar, gaining the ability to deal high damage at range. However,
Terrorblade's low natural health makes him quite fragile in the early game, and his reach is rather limited without
Metamorphosis.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high damage during Metamorphosis.<br/>Good pusher.<br/>High base armor<br/>Fast
farmer<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very low starting health.<br/>Highly cooldown dependent<br/>Low mobility.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Troll Warlord is one of the strongest hard carries in the whole game. His signature ability,
Berserker's Rage, allows him to switch between melee and ranged autoattacks, both with their pros and cons. He is most
devastating in a one vs. one situation because of his ability Fervor but he also can put out major damage in teamfights
with Whirling Axes either slowing the enemy or making them miss. Finally, his ultimate Battle Trance gives the hero and
his team increased attack speed, useful for taking objectives such as Roshan or enemy
buildings.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very fast attack speed<br/>One of the best 1v1 heroes in the game<br/>Melee and
ranged forms<br/>Global, multipurposed ultimate<br/>Can chainstun the enemy by bashing<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item
dependent<br/>No escape mechanism<br/>Extremely vulnerable to disables<br/>Depends on lifesteal and bashes for
survivability<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Ursa is a simple carry/anti-tank hero who specialises in quickly taking out enemies one at a time. He
is powerful from start to finish, tearing apart enemies and getting early Roshan kills for his team with the help of his
passive Fury Swipes. Combined with Overpower and Enrage, Ursa can quickly take down even the toughest heroes. However,
his damage output is strictly limited to melee range and he has no mobility options, making him a prime target for enemy
disables and thus heavily reliant on items such as Black King Bar and Blink Dagger.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Best solo
Roshan killer in the game.<br/>Very high single target damage.<br/>Efficient early/mid game
jungler.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<br/>Low mobility.<br/>No
disables.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Vengeful Spirit is a very strong and well-balanced support who specializes in roaming, ganking and
disabling. Unlike most other casting supports, her skill set emphasizes physical damage over magical, allowing her
abilities to be useful in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not Item dependent<br/>Abilities useful at all stages
of the game<br/>Has Nukes and Disables<br/>High combat stat gains<br/>Has very good debuffs<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can
be ganked very easily<br/>Limited mana pool<br/>Low attack range<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Venomancer is a support hero who can deal tremendous damage over time with his spells. He also
possesses strong push and counter-push potential in his Plague Wards, allowing him to defend towers and high-ground as
well as take enemy towers by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can deal tremendous amounts of damage when his spells are
combined.<br/>Strong slows and DOTs make him great for early ganks<br/>Wards provide lots of utility like free vision,
push/counterpush, and a basic ability to jungle<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No hard disables<br/>Generally poor
survivability<br/>Has mana problems early and mid game<br/>Large portions of his damage can be removed with items like
Pipe of Insight or Black King Bar<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Viper is medium carry whose potent Nethertoxin grow more potent as his target's health diminishes. His
Corrosive Skin poisons any who dares attack him, while his Poison Attack and Viper Strike slows any enemy to a crawl.
Because of this, Viper is an exceedingly deadly ganker during the early game, but is less potent during the late game.
Viper also lacks any disables, and struggles against enemies with spell immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful slow
makes him a great ganker in the early stage.<br/>Fairly durable.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has mana issues during the
early and mid game.<br/>No real disable.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Weaver is a slippery carry who shifts in and out of space, and turns back time to recover from his
injuries. Summoning The Swarm to latch onto his enemies, Weaver can drastically reduce enemy in teamfights. Weaver is
extremely item dependent, and must farm well throughout the game to be effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Elusive and
hard to pin down.<br/>Reduces enemy armor.<br/>Good lane pusher.<br/>Highest base damage for ranged heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Countered
by true sight.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/>Low attribute growth coupled with the lowest base stats.<br/>Very item
dependent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Ancient Apparition is a spellcaster hero whose abilities can empower, disable and destroys with the
power of ice. His ultimate, Ice Blast allows him to damage & froze his foes HP regeneration, placing them on
disadvantages during every teamfight thus making him scales very well into late game. However, Kaldr is not a beginner
friendly support as his skillset require precise timing and judgement to execute. He also quite fragile as he does not
really possesses any reliable/instant escape and disables mechanisms.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong team fight
ultimate.<br/>Long range scouting spells.<br/>(The only) hard counter to healing heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very
squishy and sluggish.<br/>Require good precision & judgement to make use of his skills (especially his ultimate).<br/>Harassment
and zoning ability is rather poor.<br/>Very level dependent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Bane is a very powerful single-target disabler who possesses reasonable nuking power. His strongest
suit is setting up kills for teammates with high damage output or unreliable stuns, making him a powerful roamer and
ganker who can assist teammates in getting kills throughout a match. This can allow him to regularly obtain reliable
gold through kills and assists, which in turn allows him to build items to suit his needs.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful
single-target disabler.<br/>Excellent starting stats, good at trading hits in the laning stage.<br/>Excellent
damage.<br/>Great laning phase and ganking abilities, seeing that Nightmare can be used is many ways, be it to save or
to set up combos and ganks.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Zero AoE capabilities, poor against early pushing line ups.<br/>Suffers
with mana problems early game.<br/>Zero Mobility.<br/>Ultimate requires channeling.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Batrider is a Intelligence hero great at ganking, most focused on disrupting the enemy team's
positioning and isolating enemies. His Flaming Lasso can be used to single out certain heroes, along with using his
Sticky Napalm to increase the damage his enemies take. His Firefly allows him to move over terrain, opening numerous
possibilities for him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the best slows in-game<br/>Good ganker<br/>Strong early game
presence<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low Attack Range<br/>Low Movement Speed<br/>Item Dependency<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Chen is a support who is one of the strongest junglers in the game, and can use his persuaded creeps
(thanks to Holy Persuasion) to gank and push very early in a game. Chen is able to weaken his adversaries with his
Penitence, and can heal all allies and neutral creeps under his control with Hand of God. His reliance on
micromanagement and map awareness makes him a difficult hero to master, but utilized properly Chen has the ability to
gain a powerful early advantage for his team, which can allow them to decisively end matches
quickly.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Natural jungler.<br/>Global Heal.<br/>Most effective pusher in early stage of the
game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very micro-intensive<br/>Very hard to play<br/>If not played properly will make enemies
gain significant gold advantages.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Crystal Maiden is an efficient support who specializes in slowing enemies. Her highly valued Arcane
Aura increases mana regeneration for all her teammates, while she remains effective throughout the game with very little
items. In large fights, she can channel a Freezing Field to obliterate enemies over a wide area, along with using
Frostbite to target individuals. However, Crystal Maiden is quite fragile even compared to other supports, and is one of
the slowest heroes in the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Gives team mana regeneration.<br/>Numerous slows.<br/>Not item
dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low movement speed.<br/>Very fragile.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Dark Seer is a semi-support hero, most focused on AOE Battles. He is able to farm safely due to Ion
Shell which can also be used to damage his enemies. He can make himself and his allies reach incredible speeds with
Surge, along with using Vacuum and Wall of Replica in conjuction with each other to initiate and deal damage using the
enemies' own power.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong solo offlaner.<br/>Extremely annoying to lane against.<br/>Strong
team fight presence.<br/>Excellent at escaping or disengaging.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Melee attack range.<br/>Initiation
combo often requires a followup.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Dazzle is a support hero most well known for his ability to save his teammates from death using
Shallow Grave as well as his physical damage-focused spells. He can slow and later stun single targets with Poison
Touch, heal and harm with Shadow Wave, and increase and decrease the armor of his allies and enemies respectively using
Weave. His item-independent nature allows him to be played as a hard support and remain effective at all stages of the
game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Low cooldown ultimate.<br/>Capable of making clutch saves.<br/>Does not require items to
perform role.<br/>Strong 5-man enabler.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Offensive spells deal physical damage.<br/>Requires
attentiveness and good timing during big team fights.<br/>Not particularly durable himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Death Prophet is a powerful spellcaster, who has wide Area of Effect (AoE) spells which specialize in
pushing lanes and also devastating enemy defensive towers quickly in order to enter their enemy base, to gain victory
within a short period of time. Exorcism can devastate towers in a short period of time, while also being a great ability
for teamfights. To keep herself alive, she can use Silence and Spirit Siphon to remain active while still dealing
damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can push lanes and destroy towers quickly.<br/>High survivability.<br/>High base
movement speed allows her to chase enemies.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Lack of escape ability.<br/>Long cast animation
besides Spirit Siphon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Disruptor is a strong teamfight hero who can control the enemy team's positioning with his potent
disables. His Kinetic Field can prevent enemies from leaving the area after being set up, and when used in conjunction
with Static Storm can silence and disrupt enemies for extended periods. While he lacks nuking power, he can influence
the battlefield in such a way as to greatly hinder the enemy in engagements and prevent gank targets from escaping with
Glimpse.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great at catching and ganking heroes.<br/>Strong team fight spells.<br/>Relatively
item independent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Poor stats growth.<br/>Mediocre nuke spell.<br/>Needs good timing to get
skills off.<br/>He's useless when enemy is magic immune.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Enchantress is a very flexible Intelligence hero that can be a effective jungle hero with focus in
ganking and pushing in early stages of the game. Her Enchant allows her to control neutral creeps, allowing her to use
their abilities and gain benefits from their auras. She can heal herself and her allies with Nature's Attendants along
with dealing true damage with her auto attacks through Impetus.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals pure damage.<br/>Fast
movement speed.<br/>Fairly resistant to melee enemies.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very susceptible to burst damage.<br/>Extremely
low health points.<br/>Easily countered by Black King Bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Enigma is a tactical spellcaster who is known for his incredibly powerful ultimate, Black Hole.
Playing him well requires efficient farming, control of Demonic Conversion and good positioning to get the most mileage
out of his gravitational abilities. A well-played Enigma can singlehandedly win a teamfight and possibly determine the
outcome of a match by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the most efficient junglers in the game.<br/>Strong
pushing and team fight capabilities.<br/>Possesses early game ganking potential with Malefice and Eidolon damage.<br/>Black
Hole is one of the strongest team fight spells in the game.<br/>Has two large area-of-effect spells that bypasses spell
immunity and deals Pure damage.<br/>Entry level hero for players who want to hone their micromanagement
skills.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Rather lengthy cooldowns for all of his spells<br/>Very long cooldown on his ultimate,
Black Hole.<br/>Black Hole is a channeled ability with short range, thus making him vulnerable to long range disables,
silences, or other hazards.<br/>Not naturally tanky.<br/>Most certainly will be in the jungle nearly every game, making
him prone to ganks.<br/>Poor management of his Eidolons can give his opponents an edge in their
farming.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Invoker is one of the most difficult to learn heroes in the game, but also one of the most flexible
and powerful casters. As such, his skill floor is not impossibly high, however, his skill ceiling is almost
unparalleled, and thus he takes significant amounts of practice in order to learn. Because of his need for quick levels
and gold, he is usually played as a mid hero. Due to Invoker's heavy level requirement in order to be effective, it is
generally advised to focus on leveling two orbs and getting a value point in the third, rather than trying to level all
three equally. While Invoker can be more flexible if he can cast strong spells in all categories, the lack of
specialization also limits his potency in areas where his team might need him to be strong. Invoker can only truly reach
his full strength at level 25, and as such he needs to be able to effectively contribute to teamfights before reaching
that point.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely versatile.<br/>Numerous disables.<br/>Deadly magic combos.<br/>Can push
quite well.<br/>Good solo killing ability with Quas-Exort.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Steep learning curve.<br/>Requires
significant early farm to be effective.<br/>Not very good at farming compared to other cores.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Jakiro is a tanky intelligence hero with low cooldown damage over time spells and high amounts of
magic damage. He offers a large amount of teamfight with Ice Path and Macropyre ,and push with Dual Breath and Liquid
Fire<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky lane support.<br/>Fast and efficient lane pusher/tower sieger.<br/>Low cooldown
disables.<br/>Large AoE control.<br/>Not item-dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily avoidable spells with longer
cast times.<br/>Fairly slow.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Keeper of the Light is an adept support who is capable of aiding his allies and hindering his enemies
with his array of spells. He can be a strong babysitter whose presence greatly augments the power of a lane, and
transition into a pusher and counter-pusher past the laning stage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not Item dependent<br/>Can
give mana to team and to himself<br/>High movement speed even without boots<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can die easily<br/>Countered
by heroes who don't need mana<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Leshrac is renowned as one of the strongest nukers in the game, who is capable of putting out
tremendous amounts of area magical damage in order to destroy his foes. These nukes are strong at killing both heroes
and creeps, making Leshrac a powerful foe both in teamfights and while pushing.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great wave
clearing<br/>Good tower pushing with Diabolic Edict<br/>Large amounts of AOE magic damage<br/>Good movement speed<br/>Very
low cooldown spells<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Bad strength and mediocre armor...<br/>...but still needs to be in the
thick of the fight to deal damage<br/>Poor cast animations<br/>Most of his damage output is completely negated by magic
immunity<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Lich is a ranged intelligence hero that is primarily used to win the laning stage of the game with
Sacrifice. Sacrifice denies the opponent experience points and gives them to you and your allies. Once past the laning
stage, Lich is still a threat with Chain Frost. Lich does not have any strong escape mechanism and is rather frail, so
proper positioning is a must.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Almost always able to dominates the laning stage and thus
securing the early advantage for your team<br/>Simple to play, great for beginners<br/>A good nuker with spammable Frost
Blast<br/>Able to destroy the enemy team if they are poorly positioned and huddled close with Chain Frost.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has
no escape capabilities and is quite frail<br/>Is not as strong past the laning/early stage of the
game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Lina is a powerful ranged intelligence hero that can be played as a support or a semi-carry. Her
abilities allow her to nuke and stun multiple heroes at once and her strong ultimate can annihilate low health heroes.
Her passive allows her right-clicks to far exceed that of other typical intelligence heroes, giving her a very
respectable amount of physical damage output. Played well, Lina is an extremely strong ganking hero who can kill out of
position heroes all by herself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong AoE nukes.<br/>Very powerful single target nuke.<br/>Long
attack range.<br/>Deals fairly high physical damage with passive.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow cast animations.<br/>Slow
attack animation.<br/>No mobility.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Lion is a powerful spellcaster and is mostly played as support or ganker hero due to his disabling
spells. He is best to partner with auto attack carries or another spellcaster to finish enemies quickly. His Earth Spike
and his Hex make him a formidible disabler, while his Mana Drain can prevent enemy heroes from casting spells if done
effectively and allowed to drain. His Finger of Death can easily nuke the chosen enemy, dealing incredible damage to
help his allies or himself finish a kill.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the best disabler hero.<br/>Good early/mid
game nuker.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily targeted due to low health.<br/>Slow movement.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Necrophos is a highly survivable intelligence hero whose power scale with how long he survives in a
fight and eventually how long the game becomes due to his capability of taking out crucial targets and pro-longing their
death with his ultimate Reaper's Scythe. Despite having a heal in his kit, Necrophos is not supportive by nature and
should not be used as one as for a support, healing is all he can contribute and he is not that good at it.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deceptively
durable when played correctly.<br/>Very effective in any teamfight, especially long ones.<br/>Fairly straightforward
with his spells, making him easy to play.<br/>Can lengthen respawn times of key enemy Heroes, or those that bought back.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slightly
item dependent.<br/>Not naturally durable.<br/>Not too reliable escape mechanism.<br/>Sluggish movement speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Ogre Magi is the embodiment of "dumb muscle". While having a meager mana pool for an intelligence
hero, his health pool can become one of the largest in the game. Not needing very many items, Ogre is potent at all
points in the game, being able to easily trade hits early on, burst foes in the mid game, and help with late game
pushes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has the third highest Strength gain at 3.2 per level, with 23 base strength.<br/>Second
highest base armor at 8<br/>Has a stun and a slow in his kit<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Second lowest base intelligence
and third lowest intelligence gain<br/>Slow movement speed with no mobility skills<br/>One of the few melee intelligence
heroes<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Oracle is a versatile spell caster whose spells can be used defensively or offensively depending on
how the combinations of spells are used. A well timed ultimate can change a surprise attack from the enemy into a failed
gank. Oracle is not very mobile and is susceptible to getting picked or focused first in fights if poorly
positioned.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong spammable nukes<br/>Great spell utility, Fate's Edict can be used to negate
magical damage or disarm opponents for example.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Lacks any strong area of effect spells<br/>Inexperienced
players might cause more harm than good to their team or aid the enemy if they cast the wrong spells at the wrong
time<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Outworld Devourer is a carry and a disabler. He is one of the few damage dealers who can also reset
fights, break chain stuns, and save teammates thanks to his Astral Imprisonment. He is also one of the few heroes who
can reliably deal pure damage thanks to Arcane Orb, which can also steal intelligence from heroes and does extra damage
against summons and illusions. Nearby allies benefit from Essence Aura as they have a chance to regain a percentage of
their max mana each spell cast. Finally, Sanity's Eclipse not only deals damage in a large radius based on Outworld
Devourer's current intelligence, but also remove 40% of their maximum mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals massive
amounts of pure damage.<br/>Capable of snowballing out of control.<br/>Punishes mana dependent and low intelligence
heroes.<br/>High starting move speed.<br/>Chain stun breaker<br/>Excellent gank setup<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Damage is
nullified by spell immunity or when silenced.<br/>Ineffective vs high intelligence heroes.<br/>Bad at destroying
buildings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Puck is an extremely elusive hero who misleads and disrupts enemies with a combination of disabling
items and abilities. Though vulnerable, Puck is able to initiate on enemy teams, silencing and locking down opponents
before teleporting away in a glowing orb. Puck's arsenal of tricks and items require sharp situational awareness during
teamfights, and can be overwhelming to newer players. Nonetheless, a well-played Puck can escape nearly any situation,
and return to repeatedly disable opponents for his teammates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very hard to pin down.<br/>Fairly
mobile.<br/>Good lane ganker.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Slow turn rate.<br/>Requires
multitasking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Pugna is a utility caster whose spells give him strong nuking power and offer utility in various
situations. He offers strong teamfight contribution and can push and counter-push very effectively with his
nukes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High mobility<br/>Devastating nukes<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health pool<br/>Low
armor<br/>Sloppy attack animation and attack speed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Queen of Pain is a fearsome mid laner who has impressive mobility through Blink, along with several
spells that deal significant damage. Despite her sizeable amounts of damage, she is very fragile and weak to disables,
and must be played smartly in order to succeed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great blink<br/>Can burst down foes quickly
with her spells<br/>Two good AoE spells in Scream of Pain and Sonic Wave<br/>Her ultimate ignores Magic Resistance and
Spell Immunity as it deals Pure damage<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low HP and Armor<br/>Is suddenly very vulnerable if she
blinks in and fails to kill a target with her combo<br/>Sonic Wave can be dodged<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Rubick is a flexible spellcaster, best known for his ability to copy enemies last used spells to use
against them. He is commonly picked as a counter to big teamfight spells such as Tidehunter's Ravage, Enigma's Black
Hole and Earthshaker Echo Slam.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Instant cast time for stolen spells<br/>High mana
capacity.<br/>Reliable Stun and Nuke that works very well in early-mid game.<br/>High Magic Resistance.<br/>Not
item-dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health pool<br/>Lack of damage<br/>Rubick's strength and effectiveness
depends on Enemy's team picks.<br/>One of the hardest heroes to play in this game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Demon is an excellent defensive support capable of resetting fights, counter-initiating, and
dealing with blinks and magic-immunity. His Disruption working well as a way to break up chain stuns as well as set up
an ally's stun, debuffing the enemy with Soul Catcher is a 50% damage increase, while his ultimate Demonic Purge slows
and dispels enemies even through magic immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Magic immunity piercing debuffs<br/>Chain stun
breaker<br/>Excellent gank setup<br/>Wave clear and tower push with Shadow Poison and Disruption illusions<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No
hard crowd control<br/>Offers little sustain in and after fights<br/>Nuke requires time to build up
damage<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Shaman is a very powerful ganker and pusher, who possesses very strong disables and nukes. His
spells allow him to disable lone enemies for extended periods of time, making them easy prey for his teammates, or to
make short work of creep waves and towers.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong early game nukes<br/>Long duration
disables<br/>Works well with almost any hero<br/>Can splitpush lanes and take towers quickly<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very
mana dependent<br/>No escape mechanism<br/>Low mobility<br/>More item and level dependent than other
supports<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Silencer is an intelligence-based teamfight-oriented hero that scales exceptionally well thanks to his
innate ability Intelligence Steal. He is able to render any magic user useless with his Last Word and Arcane Curse. His
signature ultimate, Global Silence can make a swift table turns in teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can steal 2
intelligence for every hero he killed or die nearby him.<br/>Can be played either as a support or as a carry.<br/>Can
harass enemies in the lane effectively.<br/>Deals pure damage with Glaives of Wisdom.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no
real "instant" silence besides his ultimate.<br/>Has no escape abilities and is easy to gank.<br/>Weakness against Black
King Bar limits his effectiveness as a carry.<br/>Is less effective if he didn't have a good early game and didn't steal
enough intelligence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Skywrath Mage is a very strong nuker whose spells allow him to deal tremendous amounts of magic damage
to enemy heroes. If left uninterrupted, he is a force to be reckoned with and is capable of destroying enemy heroes by
himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage from spells<br/>Long cast range<br/>High mana
pool<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very fragile<br/>Low armor<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Storm Spirit Storm Spirit is a very mobile ganker who thrives on an aggressive play style. While he is
very mana-hungry and difficult to master, he more than makes up for this by rewarding players with aggressive mindsets
and good dexterity, who can use his abilities to jump on foes from extremely long distances, pummel them down with
tremendous amounts of magical damage, and escape before their allies can turn on him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Incredibly
mobile.<br/>High snowball potential.<br/>Low cooldowns on all of his skills.<br/>Can reliably solo-kill most fragile
heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can run out of mana very quickly without proper management.<br/>Very vulnerable in the
early game.<br/>Very farm dependent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Techies is a very unorthodox hero in the game, as their team contribution comes mainly from placing
traps outside of combat rather than engaging enemies in fights. Playing Techies requires good map awareness and game
sense in order to know when and where to place traps.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high attack range.<br/>Excellent
base armor (7).<br/>Not dependent on teamfights to be effective.<br/>Very long root with Stasis Trap.<br/>Can deny self
with Blast Off!.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very mana dependent in the early game.<br/>Low starting health.<br/>Lowest
starting damage.<br/>Easily countered by silence and summoned units.<br/>Very low mobility.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Tinker is a very mobile nuking hero with powerful pushing and disabling potential depending on how he
is built. He should be played around his ultimate, as it allows him to cast his spells and use his abilities multiple
times in a single engagement.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful magical and pure damage nukes, high damage AoE magic
damage.<br/>Very hard to push against without specific items or team composition.<br/>Skillful players can outplay
multiple opponents by themselves.<br/>Generally extremely effective against single targets with the use of items in
conjunction with Rearm.<br/>Semi-Global presence when Boots of Travel are acquired.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item
dependent<br/>Vulnerable to lockdown, fragile, no innate escape mechanism.<br/>High skill ceiling, high levels of
awareness and dexterity needed to play effectively.<br/>No answer to Magic Immunity.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Visage is a highly flexible Hero, able to push and gank very effectively, packing within his abilities
a massive nuke with very low cooldown and one powerful slow, useful for taking down enemies when ganking. He is also a
strong teamfighter, able to cause tons of damage and apply long-lasting disables with his Familiars, which give Visage
its fame for his difficult learning curve, due to his dependence on effective micromanagement of those. Once mastered,
Visage becomes a devastating support, with a mix between physical damage, magical damage and long length disables and
able to push, gank and fight with his Familiars.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals large amounts of single target
damage.<br/>Can end up being extremely durable.<br/>Capable of quickly transitioning into a semi-carry with successful
ganks.<br/>Movement Speed and attack speed drain, which can be useful in many ways.<br/>AoE long length
stun.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable early game.<br/>Level dependent.<br/>Requires intermediate micro skills.<br/>Loses
effectiveness if Familiars are dead.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Warlock is a powerful spellcaster capable of turning the tide of teamfights, bringing the Hell powers
with his abilities, bonding his enemies to suffer with the same catastrophic fate. He is almost entirely dependent on
good positioning, due to lack of front line abilities, but has great cast ranges on his abilities, allowing you to
disrupt your enemies from long distances. Warlock also brings a good healing that can also be used to damage enemies,
doing a fine job as a lane partner. His ultimate, Chaotic Offering, calls down a powerful summon along with a magic
immunity piercing stun that covers the battlefield almost entirely, causing some huge troubles to your
enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Many teamfight abilities.<br/>Has a good heal/damage ability.<br/>The Golem can
unleash tons of AoE damage, rather efficient for farming waves or the jungle.<br/>Huge AoE 84% slow (

channeling.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

skill cap<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Farm and level dependent<br/>Low armor/spell resistance<br/>Single-target damage<br/>Requires
good positioning<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Winter Wyvern is a powerful nuker who also provides utility in her spells, making her a well-rounded
support. As she does not require gold in order to be effective, she is well-suited to playing as a hard support,
protecting her safe lane carry and rotating to gank with her spells.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Scales well into the late
game<br/>Does not need items to do her job, and can focus on warding the map<br/>Is a decent pusher if you use your
abilities right<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Falls off mid game when most damage is magic, but comes back online late game
when physical carries start to come online<br/>Bad Winter's Curse usage can lose a winning team fight.<br/>Cold Embrace
makes the ally unable to move, making them easy prey to magical nukers<br/>Bad movement speed<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

the flow of battle with his ultimate.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Ultimate is very damaging with a short cooldown<br/>Maledict

very easily<br/>Ultimate can be disrupted by stun<br/>Maledict is hard to cast<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Playstyle</h3>Zeus is an intelligence based hero played solely as a nuker. He has the highest magical damage output
of any hero in the game and his strongest aspect is his early to mid game dominance as well as a extremely strong late
game, even with minimal farm. If you play him correctly he can easily win games on his own.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Does
a massive amount of magic damage<br/>Global Ult<br/>Strong midgame nukes<br/>Easy to play<br/>Can easily
snowball<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Not flexible<br/>Needs mana control<br/>Low mobility<br/>Useless if enemy have Magic
