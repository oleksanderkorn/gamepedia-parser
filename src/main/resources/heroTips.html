<body><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Abaddon is versatile hero who specializes in absorbing damage and shielding his teammates. Unlike other supports, Abaddon's Borrowed Time allows him to be in the middle of the fight, converting heavy attacks back into health. His Mist Coil Aphotic Shield makes it frustratingly hard for enemies to bring down his allies, and their low cooldowns can turn fights around at crucial moments. Curse of Avernus slows foes hit by your sword, giving them a hard time running from you and your allies (since you can hit them with no worries while your ultimate is off cooldown), at the same time increasing your allies attack speed and movement speed if they also hit the enemy. Although Abaddon's common build seldom allows him to do enough damage to kill enemies alone, he can still provide cheap nuke damage while played as support, and under favorable circumstances, he can also be played as a semi-carry.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very tanky support.<br/>Low cooldowns.<br/>Can fulfill multiple roles.<br/>Has a built-in dispel.<br/>Great support for beginners.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mobility.<br/>Low starting armor.<br/>Long cast animations.<br/>Mana dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Abaddon is renowned for his multipurpose spells capable of manipulating how much damage the enemy is able to deal to his team, and turn it against them. In this way, Abaddon is not only able to protect and heal his teammates, but also possesses offensive potential capable of dealing damage to enemies as well.<br/>Abaddon's versatile skill set allows him to be played as either a carry or a support, depending on what his team needs. He is able to gear his skill build towards protecting teammates and shielding them from harm, or for more offensive purposes to give himself more damage output.<br/>Beware that Abaddon has very long cast animations for Mist Coil and Aphotic Shield, requiring roughly 50% more time to cast his spells than most other heroes. Positioning and planning ahead are crucial for allowing Abaddon to get his spells off in time.<br/>One of Abaddon's early weaknesses is his poor agility, resulting in low base armor (and thus vulnerability to physical damage despite being a strength hero) and poor attack speed (hampering his carry potential). Rectifying his armor weakness is crucial in order to make him effective in any role he plays, though improving his attack speed is dependent on if he is playing as a carry.<br/> Depending on if he is being built as a support or carry, Abaddon has differing itemization priorities and skill builds.
<br/>Abaddon is generally played as a safe lane support due to the vast survivability his skills provide for his team. His role in the safe lane is to control lane equilibrium through pulling creep waves, as his ability to harass the enemy off-laner is hampered by being a melee hero. He also stacks jungle camps for his carry to farm later, and acts as a babysitter capable of protecting his lane against enemy aggression with his powerful survivability spells. As a support he focuses on building mana items to allow him to continue casting his spells, and HP regen items to fuel the cost of Mist Coil, then utility items to give his team an advantage in fights. His skill build aims towards maxing out Aphotic Shield and Mist Coil first in order to maximize his early nuking power while also protecting his teammates.<br/>As a carry, Abaddon must gear towards tankiness and damage output, forcing the enemy to treat him as a threat so that he can take advantage of his ultimate. A carry Abaddon is geared less towards casting but more towards damage output, prioritizing Mist Coil for nuking power and Curse of Avernus for attack speed. Unlike most carries that try to directly attack and kill the enemy, Abaddon's carry potential lies in forcing the enemy to engage him and wasting their nukes and disables on him, and then negating that damage with his ultimate.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Mist Coil</h4>Mist Coil's low cooldown allows it to be used multiple times in an engagement at all points of the game. It can be used as a heal in one cast, a damage nuke in another, and even cast to break Linken's Sphere on an enemy or Roshan.<br/>Beware of overtaxing yourself when using this spell repeatedly. While its low mana cost and short cooldown allows Abaddon to almost always have this spell at the ready, getting too low in HP can prevent him from being effective in fights due to the danger of dying to enemy focus without Borrowed Time, or being forced to use his ultimate too early.<br/> The health cost of Mist Coil is dealt as Pure damage, which allows it to interact with Abaddon's other spells.
<br/>Because it is treated as damage by game mechanics, Mist Coil's damage is affected by both Aphotic Shield and Borrowed Time. Casting Mist Coil during an active Aphotic Shield prevents Abaddon from taking damage while simultaneously adding to its damage threshold, and can either proc Borrowed Time passively when falling below 400 HP or heal Abaddon if it is already active.<br/>The self-damage from Mist Coil is also lethal, which allows Abaddon to commit suicide with the spell. Deliberately used in this manner, Abaddon can deny himself in the face of attacking enemies, preventing them from profiting from his death.<br/>During pushes, Abaddon can cast Mist Coil and/or Aphotic Shield on a currently tanking lane creep, to boost their survivability.<br/>Use Mist Coil to secure last-hits at range.<h4>Aphotic Shield</h4>Casting Aphotic Shield on an ally applies a strong dispel on them, removing stuns as well as all otherwise purgeable debuffs. This makes the spell extremely strong against long-duration disables such as Sacred Arrow, Fiend's Grip, Chaos Bolt and so on, as the disable can be immediately broken and the target allowed to act.<br/>Aphotic Shield can be used as a farming and pushing spell, due to its area damage. Placing the shield on the leading creep in an attacking wave shields it from damage for a short time, and then inflicts area damage on the enemy creep wave once it bursts. Similarly, casting it on Abaddon while farming neutral camps allows him to deal nuke damage after shielding himself from their attacks.<br/>Abaddon's Aphotic Shield can be used to harass enemy farm. By placing the shield on an allied creep with low hp, enemy heroes will be denied the last hit, otherwise suffer shield damage in the process. This allows easy creep denying after the shield bursts. Abaddon can also deny the creep himself to make the shield burst if the enemy hero doesn't do so. This can harass melee heroes and ranged heroes to a certain extent, making it a lot harder for them to farm.<br/>Used as a counter-gank spell, Aphotic Shield has the power to completely turn situations around. Shielding a teammate who is being ganked stops them from taking damage (and can be further augmented by healing them with Mist Coil), forcing the enemy to commit additional time and attacks, and then turning that damage against them, effectively causing a double shift in HP of the shield's listed value. The damage from a bursting shield can potentially damage an enemy enough to bring them within kill range.<br/>In the same vein, Aphotic Shield is a powerful tower-diving spell for finishing off weak enemies. Placing Aphotic Shield on an ally prevents them from taking damage from tower hits for a short time, and the shield bursting deals nuke damage to the enemy, usually enough to finish them off. As well, tower-diving allies do not need to stop to perform cast or attack animations in order for the shield to burst, allowing them to easily chase within range of the detonation.<br/>Unlike most other sources of damage negation, Aphotic Shield blocks any damage that is taken (after reductions. This means that magic resistance and armor can increase Aphotic Shield's potency, as none of the shield's power is wasted on damage that is reduced by resistances (e.g., a 200 magic damage nuke on a target with 25% magic resistance deals 150 damage to the shield).<br/>Casting Aphotic Shield upon the same target before its duration has ended automatically detonates the shield before reapplying another. Combining this tactic with its massive radius can help to increase your DPS in a teamfight or finish off enemies during a chase.<h4>Curse of Avernus</h4>In practical terms, the short debuff duration of Curse of Avernus means that Abaddon must constantly focus on attacking an enemy in order to inflict them with the slow for more than a short period of time. Additionally, allies must coordinate with Abaddon in order to ensure that they can maintain the speed buffs through focusing on affected enemies, as the buff duration is only marginally longer than the debuff.<br/>During the laning phase, Curse of Avernus can be a useful spell to get at least one level in, as the movement speed shift can allow Abaddon and his allies to gain a speed advantage over gank targets. This can also be used defensively, inflicting a ganking enemy with the debuff to prevent them from easily chasing allies.<br/>Curse of Avernus can be a useful spell for farming, as it reduces neutral creeps' attack speed while boosting that of Abaddon, increasing his damage output while simultaneously reducing theirs to mitigate any damage dealt to Abaddon's HP pool.<br/>In concert to the above, Abaddon can push creep waves surprisingly well through judicious use of Curse of Avernus. Inflicting the debuff on enemy creeps reduces their damage output while also boosting that of allied creeps, causing the creep wave to push towards the enemy base without needing to expend mana. The curse can also be inflicted on enemy buildings, particularly their towers, cutting down their attack interval while also increasing that of all creeps attacking them, accelerating the tower's destruction.<br/>Abaddon benefits from building items that provide additional slows, as they stack linearly with that applied by Curse of Avernus. Further reducing the enemy's movement and attack speed can give Abaddon and his team a powerful mobility advantage.<br/>Remember that while Curse of Avernus's debuff can be purged, it can also be applied through spell immunity. This allows Abaddon to inhibit the enemy's attempts to re-position and attack even if they activate spell immunity, which can give his team a crucial edge in fights.<h4>Borrowed Time</h4>Borrowed Time is a good way to make the enemy to waste time and spells on Abaddon, as he can simply heal back up and force them to engage him all over again when their abilities are on cooldown. This is best exploited if Abaddon is already at full health, as the enemy then needs to expend resources to bring him to low health first, before proccing Borrowed Time.<br/>Abaddon can tower-dive quite effectively in the early game combined with Borrowed Time, as he can simply ignore tower and creep damage in his pursuit, and then finish the foe off with his other spells. Remember that Mist Coil's self-damage is treated as a heal during Borrowed Time, allowing Abaddon to use it as a self-heal and nuke with only mana as its cost.<br/>During Borrowed Time, Aphotic Shield does not proc any damage shielding, as any incoming damage is treated as a heal after reductions. Casting Aphotic Shield during Borrowed Time not only removes debuffs from Abaddon, but also leaves him with a fresh shield once it ends.<br/>If the enemy attempts to avoid attacking Abaddon during Borrowed Time in an effort to prevent him from healing, Abaddon can force the issue by taking advantage of enemy area nukes and attracting the attention of the enemy's towers and creeps. Spells such as Macropyre, Midnight Pulse and March of the Machines can deal area damage outside of the casting hero's control, and can be used as sources of healing during Borrowed Time.<br/>Abaddon retains the ability to cast Borrowed Time through any disables excluding Silence and Hex. This allows Abaddon to snap himself out of most enemy disables, including targeted channels like Dismember and Fiend's Grip and directly engage the enemy or cast his spells (for instance, to heal an ally with Mist Coil or protect them with Aphotic Shield). However, beware of persisting area disables such as Ice Path and Chronosphere, which can immediately disable Abaddon again after casting.<br/>Beware that since the damage instance that procs Borrowed Time is not healed up, it is possible for Abaddon to die if an attack brings him from above 400 HP to death in a single instance, as Borrowed Time does not passively proc. In order to circumvent this, Borrowed Time can be manually cast before reaching the threshold, and with good timing can bait the enemy into healing Abaddon.<br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Abaddon gains the ability to shield all nearby allies from harm during Borrowed Time, by giving them a damage resistance buff that redirects half of all damage they would otherwise take to Abaddon during his ultimate. Used at the right time, it can give teammates much more survivability by doubling their effective HP against all damage types for the duration of Borrowed Time, while forcing the enemy to heal Abaddon himself.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Alchemist is a formidable carry capable of amassing large amounts of gold, and sustaining himself almost indefinitely during teamfights. Armed with a Shadow Blade, Alchemist can also gank effectively by stunning enemies with Unstable Concoction. Because of the extra gold from his Greevil's Greed, Alchemist will always snowball into a potent fighter if a match goes long. Under Chemical Rage, a well-farmed Alchemist can demolish heroes and structures alike with alarmingly fast attack speed, all the while regenerating his health at incredible rates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Scales well into late game.<br/>Good comeback potential.<br/>Capable of farming gold quickly.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly reliant on his ultimate.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Worst stat growth in the game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Alchemist is a fairly heavy carry, but may still have trouble dealing with other hard carries, such as Spectre.<br/>Alchemist farms faster than any other hero, thank to his 3rd ability, Greevil's Greed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Acid Spray</h4>Use Acid Spray to farm in lane if your opponents are harassing you heavily.<br/>Acid Spray is useful in farming creeps. Ask a support to stack camps for you.
<br/>It is possible for Alchemist to farm ancient creeps safely early on with Acid Spray. Combined with Greevil's Greed, this can give Alchemist incredible amounts of gold over time. It is not uncommon to have expensive items like Radiance or Mjollnir by 14 minutes with this strategy.<br/>Acid Spray can also be used to stack creeps from a distance. Using it on creeps will cause them to automatically pursue Alchemist, and therefore move away from the camp.<br/>Use Acid Spray to dissuade enemies from defending their towers, or pushing into yours.<br/>If playing mid, use Acid Spray to push the wave before you pick up the rune every two minutes.<h4>Unstable Concoction</h4>One point in Unstable Concoction is usually enough until other abilities have been leveled.<br/>Smart opponents can make it difficult to land Unstable Concoction by juking and avoiding your vision, causing the backfire. It may be better to use it immediately when an enemy reaches the treeline, even if you lose damage and stun duration.<br/>Enemies will attempt to disable Alchemist while Unstable Concoction is brewing, preventing him from throwing it and causing him to suffer a long stun in addition to the first enemy disable. Try to stay out of reach until you are ready to throw Unstable Concoction.<br/>Fully brewed, Unstable Concoction is one of the most potent stuns in the game, in both damage and stun duration. The enemy is able to see your timer. It is imperative that you either start channeling within range, or channel a few seconds of the concoction from within fog before revealing yourself. This ability is most devastating to low armor heroes that almost take its full damage upon impact, especially if they are softened up by Acid Spray.<br/>If you are in a tight spot and have no way to escape with low health, Unstable Concoction can be used to deny yourself.<br/>It may not be a good idea to charge Unstable Concoction if you believe you are about to lose vision of an enemy (such as when chasing through trees), as you could end up stunning yourself.<br/>Begin charging Unstable Concoction before using Shadow Blade or Silver Edge to take enemies by surprise.<br/>Unstable Concoction can be used to deny yourself. If you find yourself in a sticky situation with Chemical Rage on cooldown and no means of escape, you can channel this spell in the hopes of denying yourself.<h4>Greevil's Greed</h4> An early point significantly increases Alchemist's  income. 
<br/>Putting your first skill point into it can gain you a 200 gold advantage if your team can secure the  on your side of the map. You may even be able to double it if you can get both Bounty Runes on your side of the map.
<br/>If you are feeling particularly lucky or daring, you can try to steal the Bounty Runes on your opponent's end before claiming the runes on your side of the map.<br/>Don't be to quick to learn this skill immediately when the match starts. You should invest the your first point into this skill only if you can guarantee that you will claim the rune, as if your teammates or opponents happen to steal it from you, you will be at a severe disadvantage during the early laning stages, as Alchemist's melee range, poor damage and attack speed makes it difficult for him to last-hit effectively.<h4>Chemical Rage</h4>Chemical Rage disjoints projectiles, but can be difficult to time properly.<br/>Feel free to use Chemical Rage for its healing effects; it even regenerates its own mana cost over the duration, and even more if you have percentage bonuses for mana regeneration from items like Sage's Mask or Perseverance.<br/>When Chemical Rage is on cooldown, Alchemist is extremely squishy due to his poor strength gain and low armor.<br/>Chemical Rage is the strongest single target DPS booster in the game (giving a 70% boost in DPS at level 3). This means that Alchemist scales very strongly with attack damage boosting items, however at the same time Alchemist does very little damage without such items. This means if Alchemist is going to contribute into team battles down the road, it is imperative to get yourself some attack damage.<br/>It is important to understand that the Base Attack Time change of Chemical Rage does not alter the value of attack speed, neither up nor down. You still want to have a good mix of items that give attack speed and damage.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Axe is a very strong initiator and disabler as he possesses an area disable capable of piercing spell immunity in Berserker's Call, and a low-cooldown slow in Battle Hunger that also boosts his movement speed. Given mobility and mana sustain, Axe is capable of wreaking havoc against enemies at all points of the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful ganker once he gets his Blink Dagger.<br/>Very good at punishing melee heroes in lane.<br/>Can farm lanes and the jungle very quickly.<br/>Almost completely unaffected by spell immunity.<br/>Very resistant to physical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Damage output falls off in the late game.<br/>Can have a hard time against ranged heroes in lane.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Countered by Nukers and Disablers.<br/>If Axe sees a group of enemies, he should be very careful, as he needs to catch the entire group with his Berserker's Call, otherwise, the less enemies caught in Axe's trap, the more chances of dying he gets.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>The synergy between Berserker's Call and Counter Helix means that Axe is capable of dealing great amounts of pure damage during initiations, but must build for survivability to ensure he is not killed by enemy attacks during his initiations.<br/>Axe's spells give him powerful harassment potential and survivability, allowing him to punish enemy lanes and gain an early advantage for his team. In order to transition well into the late game he requires farm, however his initiation and disabling abilities allow him to set up ganks and early teamfights to get the gold he needs to remain relevant.<br/> As a melee initiator with strong survivability spells, Axe can be a very strong off-laner, or a powerful jungler.
<br/>A combination of Berserker's Call and Counter Helix make Axe a good off-laner, as he can deal large amounts of damage with Counter Helix if the enemy dares to attack him at melee range. As well, he has the ability to force the enemy to attack him via Berserker's Call if he can get close enough, also using his enemy's lane creeps against them to increase the proc chance of Counter Helix.<br/>Counter Helix allows Axe to be a strong jungler, as he can whittle down neutral camps without expending mana. Additionally, Axe's position in the jungle allows him to rotate mid to help set up ganks, or help to harass and gank the enemy's off-laner.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Berserker's Call</h4>Berserker's Call is a taunt that forces all enemies near Axe to attack him, while simultaneously boosting his armor to allow him to weather the enemy attacks.<br/>Berserker's Call is Axe's prime initiating and disabling ability, as it cannot be blocked by spell immunity or Linken's Sphere. In order to utilize it to its utmost, Axe must possess strong mobility, namely Blink Dagger in order to instantly jump into the midst of the enemy to make the most of it.<br/>Because of its short duration, Berserker's Call benefits greatly from assistance from allied area-of-effect disables. By taunting the enemy and forcing them to bunch up, Axe can open the enemy team up for follow-up disables such as Light Strike Array, Hoof Stomp, Black Hole, and so on. Conversely, Berserker's Call can also be assisted by allied setup, such as Vacuum and Reverse Polarity.<br/>When chasing enemies that are trying to escape, Berserker's Call can be useful for holding them in place for Axe's teammates to catch up. Additionally, it can be useful for interrupting Town Portal Scrolls, as taunting the enemy will cause them to break the channeling and attack Axe, preventing them from escaping.<br/>Beware that unlike Axe's other spells, Berserker's Call has a 0.4 cast animation. If possible, try to get as close to enemies as possible before taunting, or try to lead your blink so that they will run into the call's area as it is cast.<br/>If a Blade Mail has been purchased, it is sometimes most optimal to activate it after Berserker's Call has ended, depending on targets. Activating it at the end of the duration will give Axe an extra 4.5 seconds of survivability, as enemy players will be further punished for targeting Axe with nukes and additional attacks once they are able to control their heroes. Additionally, it will buy time for Berserker's Call to come off cooldown to be cast again, as at max level it has a cooldown of only 10 seconds, meaning that Axe only has to survive for two more seconds after Blade Mail. Use it during Berserker's Call for additional burst damage, for instance if catching a hero in Berserker's Call that has high damage output but low health it can be used to completely eliminate the target during the duration of Berserker's Call.<br/>Berserker's Call is capable of taunting invisible enemies. One useful way to bring enemies out of invisibility is to try to cast it if they are near Axe; this will force the enemy to attack him, bringing them out of invisibility. This can be useful for interrupting abilities like Meld, or interrupting an enemy that is channeling while under the effects of Glimmer Cape.<br/>Axe does not need to stand in place once he has successfully taunted the enemy. If he catches enemy melee heroes, it is possible for Axe to kite them away from an escape path, as they will follow him during the taunt to try to attack him. Forcibly displacing the enemy during Berserker's Call can make a huge difference depending on the terrain and allied and enemy positioning.<br/>Remember that Axe gets the bonus armor no matter if he manages to successfully taunt any enemies. If he is low on health and is trying to escape, Berserker's Call can be used simply to increase Axe's armor so that the enemy's physical attacks cannot kill him before he reaches safety.<br/>When initiating for your team, it is usually a good idea to try to target the enemy's support heroes. Not only can this prevent them from casting powerful teamfight spells, but they also tend to have low HP and armor, causing them to take much more damage from Counter Helix, and possibly putting them within Culling Blade range to remove them from the field before they can contribute at all.<br/>At maximum level, Berserker's Call is capable of disabling enemies for 3.2 seconds. If escape is necessary, Axe can attempt to taunt enemies and then immediately channel Town Portal Scroll, as he can escape during the taunt when the enemy is unable to cast stuns on him.<br/>Use Berserker's Call to taunt and reveal invisible enemies if you are certain they are nearby.<br/>Berserker's Call bonus armor makes Axe nearly immune to physical damage for a short duration, which can be used to neutralize physical nukes such as Omnislash and Unstable Concoction.<h4>Battle Hunger</h4>Battle Hunger inflicts the target enemy with a damage and slow debuff that lasts until they kill a unit.<br/>Battle Hunger can be a powerful harassing spell in the laning stage due to its long cast range and removal requirements.<br/>By casting the debuff on the enemy and then going aggressive on the lane, the enemy can be forced to retreat away from the creep wave, preventing them from killing a unit to remove the debuff. Repeated over time, this can wear down the enemy's HP and force them out of the lane altogether.<br/>Inflicting the enemy with Battle Hunger can also set up for kills if the enemy attempts to continue to lane to remove the debuff. Because the debuff slows the enemy's movement speed, casting Battle Hunger on them prior to allied initiation can slow their movement, greatly reducing their chances of escaping.<br/>In order to make the most of this spell in-lane, try to time its casting with the enemy's attempts to last-hit. Inflicting the enemy with Battle Hunger while all creeps in the lane are near full health can force them to take more damage as no opportunities to kill a unit to remove the debuff will present itself soon. As well, casting Battle Hunger on them right after they last-hit the last friendly creep in the wave will give them no targets to kill (provided their own creeps are outside of deny range), making the spell run its full course. Axe can further debilitate the enemy by last-hitting and denying as much as possible to prevent the enemy from killing any units.<br/>Casting Battle Hunger on the enemy when they have no creeps can be a great way to harass them. As they must retreat back to their tower to avoid tanking creep attacks, they will be too busy backing away to remove the debuff, and become vulnerable to tower-diving once your creeps reach the enemy tower.<br/>Remember that Battle Hunger also increases Axe's movement speed while the enemy is affected by it, on top of slowing them down. This allows Axe to quickly close the distance to fleeing enemies and catch them with Berserker's Call.<br/>Battle Hunger's long cast range allows Axe to use it as a finishing spell on a fleeing enemy who is at low health. In most situations there will be no opportunities for the enemy to remove the debuff from themselves, which can allow the spell to burn them down and kill them after the fact.<br/>There is no requirement that Battle Hunger must be cast on an enemy hero. If mobility is a priority and a fleeing enemy hero is out of range, Battle Hunger can be cast on enemy creeps in order to boost Axe's movement speed, allowing him to then get within range to cast Battle Hunger a second time on the enemy hero.<h4>Counter Helix</h4>Counter Helix allows Axe to deal pure damage in an arc around himself every time the enemy lands an attack on him, even if he is disabled.<br/>Counter Helix syngerizes extremely well with Berserker's Call, as Axe can deal spin damage to enemies that he successfully taunts. If he catches multiple enemy heroes and creeps, Axe can deal a surprising amount of damage during the taunt, wearing them down for his team.<br/>Counter Helix will only proc if an enemy lands a successful attack on Axe. This means that evasion and ethereal on Axe, or blind and disarm on the enemy, can prevent Counter Helix from proccing.<br/>Because pure damage is completely unaffected by armor and magic resistance, Counter Helix makes Axe still deal a decent amount of damage in the late game, as most enemies can do nothing against its damage besides avoid getting hit. It also pierces spell immunity, making Axe a decent counter to Black King Bar.<br/>The pure damage is also very strong against some naturally tanky heroes like Ogre Magi and Terrorblade (have very high armor), or Meepo and Viper (have higher magic resistance).<br/>Counter Helix allows Axe to quickly farm creeps, whether they are lane creeps or neutral camps, since their attacks will greatly increase its proc chance. This can also be used to harass lane opponents, particularly if they are melee, since Axe can threaten them with great amounts of damage if he manages to get close.<br/>In-lane, Axe can draw lane creep aggro by ordering an attack on an enemy hero while standing within 500 range of enemy creeps. This will draw the creeps to attack Axe, causing them to proc Counter Helix and allowing him to make quick work of the wave, pushing it towards the enemy.<br/>In order to punish weak lanes, Axe can cut creep waves with Counter Helix: get behind the enemy tower, intercept the enemy's creep wave, and destroy it with Counter Helix, forcing the enemy to tank your creeps under his tower, which will also make last-hitting harder while also exposing them to tower dives. However, enemy rotations can punish such tactics since Axe will be in an exposed location while creep-cutting, far from assistance and easy to kill.<br/>If you have successfully purchased Tranquil Boots and are jungling with Counter Helix, one tactic to conserve HP is to drop the Tranquil Boots on the ground before farming the neutral camp. This will prevent the Tranquil Boots from breaking, allowing Axe to pick them up to immediately start replenishing his HP. However, be very wary of enemy heroes encountering Axe while he is jungling, as they can pick up or destroy his Tranquil Bootswhile they are on the ground.<h4>Culling Blade</h4>Culling Blade allows Axe to immediately kill an enemy if they are at low health, going through spell immunity and any other survivability buffs (including Shallow Grave and Borrowed Time), while simultaneously boosting the attack and movement speed of all nearby allies.<br/>Effectively, Culling Blade allows Axe to reduce the maximum HP of enemy heroes by the threshold amount, as crossing below that threshold allows Axe to instantly kill them; as a lethal Culling Blade deals its damage as HP Removal, there is no way to increase or decrease this amount. It is important to know where these thresholds are in order to make the most efficient use of Culling Blade, however it is also important not to cast it too early, as failing a cull will put the ability on cooldown, preventing it from being used for the rest of the fight.<br/>Culling Blade will always credit Axe with the kill, giving him the most gold for the kill. This can allow Axe to quickly get the gold for the items he needs, however it can also deny gold to your team's carries and stunt their item progression. If possible, try to use Culling Blade only as a last resort to secure a kill, or to prevent an enemy from participating further in a teamfight.<br/>Keep in mind, Culling Blade can be blocked by Linken's Sphere even if the enemy is below the kill threshold. Casting Battle Hunger on the target first can break the Linken's Sphere, allowing Axe to finish the target off.<br/>Culling Blade will reset its cooldown if Axe successfully kills an enemy hero with the spell. This means that if removing enemies from the battlefield is a priority, Culling Blade is capable of eliminating multiple enemies in a span of seconds if he can get them low enough. However, keep in mind that Culling Blade is Axe's most mana-costly ability, so try to conserve enough mana during initiations to meet the demand if needed.<br/>The speed boost gained from a successful Culling Blade can give Axe's team a powerful mobility advantage. Try to get a successful cull as early as possible in a teamfight, as the boost can make a great difference.<br/>An Aghanim's Scepter-boosted Culling Blade not only increases in threshold and buff duration, but also drastically reduces the cooldown. One way to exploit this mechanic is to cast Culling Blade on an expendable enemy unit at the start of a fight; this will provide the speed boost at the start of an engagement, and the spell will come off cooldown by the time a cull opportunity on an enemy hero arises.<br/>Using the console or config files, binding "toggle" and "dota_health_per_vertical_marker" to an unused key can be useful for providing a visual indicator by shifting the vertical markers for HP bars depending on the level of Culling Blade. These visual indicators can show exactly where the thresholds for Culling Blade are, ensuring that the spell can be used at the first possible opportunity. For instance, bind "P" "toggle dota_health_per_vertical_marker 250 325 400 550" will cause the 'P' key to cycle through the listed values.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Beastmaster is a utility hero that brings many benefits to his team, such as clearing trees with Wild Axes. His scouting Hawk functions like a moving ward, and his Boar slows down enemies with ranged attacks. Inner Beast speeds up allied attacks, and Primal Roar is the best single-target stun in the game. That said, Beastmaster does not excel at any one particular role and is usually played as a semi-support or initiator. His summons require a modest amount of micromanagement, which can be intimidating to new players. Beastmaster can pick off supports with ease, but cannot go head-to-head against heavier heroes. Depending on the situation, players can build Beastmaster as an initiator, pusher, or an armor/strength based brawler.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Large scouting vision with Hawk.<br/>Long duration stun that goes through Spell Immunity.<br/>Good at Pushing.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low damage.<br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/>Requires some micromanagement.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Beastmaster is usually played solo in the offlane, but also sometimes in the mid lane.<br/>Some enemy setups can shut down Beastmaster in lane. If needed, ask a support to join you.<br/>Micromanaging Beastmaster's summons, especially his Hawk, is important to winning games.<br/>Compared to other supports, Beastmaster is fairly tanky.<br/>Beastmaster has no escape mechanisms. Engage carefully.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Wild Axes</h4>Wild Axes has a very long range, and can be used to pick off fleeing enemies.<br/>Wild Axes is good against juking enemies, as it cuts down trees over a wide area.<br/>Wild Axes is a powerful farming tool, clearing waves of creeps at once.
<br/>Aside from farming, Wild Axes is not very useful compared to Beastmaster's other abilities, and is usually maxed last.<br/>Use Wild Axes to stop an enemy from regenerating with Clarity or Healing Salve.<br/>Wild Axes can be used to stack/farm ancient creeps, since they affect spell immune units. This can be very effective when used in Dire offlane (bottom), as Beastmaster doesn't need to leave the lane to hit the creep camp.<br/>Be careful not to undercast Wild Axes. Always target the space behind the enemy.<br/>Wild Axes can be used to cut down trees next to lanes. This gives better vision and could save Beastmaster from a gank.<h4>Call of the Wild: Hawk</h4>The Hawk is Beastmaster's greatest asset, as it provides a large vision advantage for his team. It is usually leveled first.<br/>Because of its low cooldown, there should always be a Hawk somewhere on the map, if not two.<br/>Send a Hawk to scout ahead before a potential engagement. Even if it dies, it's well worth the sacrifice.
<br/>Keep in mind that the Hawk cannot see enemies under Smoke of Deceit.<br/>Move and place Hawks over trees. This makes them harder to detect or kill.<br/>If an enemy has spotted a scouting Hawk, and there are no impassable terrain nearby, immediately stopping the Hawk's movement may give it enough time to stealth before being killed.<br/>Don't move Hawks too often, or they will be seen.<br/>Hawks are good at scouting areas where wards are seldomly placed, like the forested edges of the map.<br/>Most players will instinctively try to kill a Hawk. If seen, move the Hawk to bait enemies into favorable positions.<br/>Hawks can be used as a target unit for Boots of Travel. Strategic placement will allow teammates to teleport to it for split pushing or ganking.<h4>Call of the Wild: Boar</h4>Because of its low cooldown, Beastmaster can have two active Boars at the same time.<br/>Assign control groups to Boars for easier microing.<br/>In teamfights, target enemy carries with Boars to slow them down, making it easier for teammates to kite them.<br/>Boars can be used to stack creeps for your team.<br/>Boars can be used to block camps against the enemy team.<br/>Target Boars on a pursuing enemies to slow them down.<br/>With very good timing, Boars can be used to deny Beastmaster (or any other ally/building).<br/>Hawks and boars give considerable experience when killed. In the laning phase, they will quickly give a level advantage to your opponent if they keep killing one or the other. Do not let that happen. Don't forget you can at least deny your boars once they're low on hp, but you should rather send them safely behind your tower and wait for them to time out.<h4>Inner Beast</h4>Inner Beast is an excellent passive for pushing. With several teammates nearby, buildings will fall very quickly.<br/>Inner Beast synergizes well with Boars, creeps, as well as units from Necronomicon. This gives Beastmaster significant pushing ability.<br/>After the early game, Beastmaster should try to stay near allied carries so they benefit from Inner Beast.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Brewmaster is an unpredictable brawler who sows disarray among enemy formations. With the help of a Blink Dagger, he jumps in to initiate with Thunder Clap, then divides into three elemental beings with Primal Split. He lands critical hits and dodges at random due to Drunken Brawler, dealing significant damage. Brewmaster is fairly tanky, and difficult to kill when he splits apart with his ultimate. However, he does not excel at any one purpose, and should be considered a hybrid between initiator, brawler, and tank.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High survivability with ultimate.<br/>Numerous disables when in ultimate form.<br/>Counters carries.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Requires fast micromanagement.<br/>No mobility skills.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Brewmaster is usually played solo in the off-lane, although he can also work as a mid hero.<br/>With his numerous disables during Primal Split, and the blind from Drunken Haze, Brewmaster is effective in shutting down physical damage carries.<br/>When playing Brewmaster, try to gain an advantage for your team early before anybody on the enemy team, particularly the carry, can build a Black King Bar, as his disables cannot penetrate spell immunity.<br/>If Brewmaster is being played more in the semi-carry role, consider using his ultimate as a life saver to keep yourself in the fight when you would normally die. The utility of the summoned spirits works excellently for finishing off opponents as well as initiation.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Thunder Clap</h4>Thunder Clap is extremely strong at the early stages of the game, acting as his area-of-effect soft disable. It is generally leveled up first due to its quite high damage.<br/> Blink next to an enemy and use Thunder Clap as an initiation ability, as it will slow their movement.
<br/>Keep in mind that sometimes there will not be time to use Thunder Clap during an initiation, as the cast time will allow enemies to disable Brewmaster. In these cases, it is better to use Primal Split right away.<h4>Drunken Haze</h4>Use Drunken Haze first on enemy carries to render them blind and useless.<br/>Drunken Haze is usually not important in the early game, and can be leveled last.<br/>Drunken Haze is a deceptively powerful debuff spell. Costing only 25 mana, it is capable of slowing and blinding an opponent for 4 seconds. With a cooldown of 5 seconds at maximum level, Brewmaster is able to inhibit an opponent's movement and attack almost indefinitely.<br/>Drunken Haze is a very useful spell to negate the protective barrier of a Linken's Sphere carrier.<h4>Drunken Brawler</h4>Drunken Brawler's ability icon changes color when a crit is ready. Use this knowledge to deal burst damage after initiating with Thunder Clap.<br/>The guaranteed critical and evasion triggers are separate from each other.<h4>Primal Split</h4> Splits Brewmaster into three units: , , and .
<br/>When Primal Split ends, Brewmaster reappears at one of the three units' locations, in this order: Earth -> Storm -> Fire.<br/>If all three units die, Brewmaster dies.<br/>Use tab to quickly cycle through each unit and use their disables on as many enemies as possible.<br/>Use Primal Split sparingly, as it has an extremely long cooldown. Try to avoid using it to run away if at all possible.<br/>Queue Blink Dagger right before Primal Split ends to immediately blink to safety. This is useful if Brewmaster had low health prior to using Primal Split.<br/> All auras Brewmaster has are bestowed around the spirits during Primal Split in this order: Earth, if Earth is dead, Storm, if Storm is also dead, Fire. The usual ones built on Brewmaster are  and/or . ,  and  should also be considered.
<br/>A special mention goes to Radiance, which considerably increases Earth's damage output, while putting Brewmaster at little risk so long as he manages to cast his ultimate. But Brewmaster is a slow farmer and he usually wants to fight well before he's gathered these expensive items.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bristleback is a very good tank not only because of his formidable health pool, but also because of one of his abilities Bristleback, making him more of a tank when fighting his back. Being a carry and a tank at the same time, he can easily become team's initiator, capable of dealing and taking tons of health in a teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very durable.<br/>Effective ganker early and mid game.<br/>Can chase down fleeing enemy easily.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has mana issues in early and mid game.<br/>Not effective against high-armor heroes.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Bristleback's mana woes can easily be remedied by a Sage's Mask or a Ring of Basilius, since his abilities have extremely low mana costs.<br/>One of Bristleback's main weaknesses is his lack of disables, meaning he cannot silence or interrupt an enemy from casting spells. You can either rely on your teammates for disables, or buy an item of your own, so long as it benefits him in some way (a good example would be a Scythe of Vyse, since it gives him good mana regeneration for his abilities, and a devastating hex disable).<br/>Beware Legion Commander and Axe, as both of them have abilities that force you to turn and face them for a few seconds, ensuring their and their teams damage is not directed to your back and thus making you far more vulnerable in a teamfight.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Viscous Nasal Goo</h4>Viscous Nasal Goo has extremely useful effects, provided that you keep casting it against your target, as it  their  for a lot when stacked up. Since each casts fully refreshes the whole stack's duration, and the duration is more than twice as long as the cooldown, after reaching the stack cap, you can time it so that you refresh the debuff before it expires, instead of continuously casting it whenever off cooldown. This way, you waste less of the duration, save some  for your quills and can catch up faster to your target.
<br/>This ability is very effective when combined with Warlock's Fatal Bonds, as the damage inflicted on the Viscous Nasal Goo target from other bound creeps or heroes is applied to the armor reduced hero at said reduced value. This makes the Bristleback/ Warlock lane combination very potent, even into the late game. When combined with area of effect items and attacks, a lot of damage can be dealt very quickly.<h4>Quill Spray</h4>Quill Spray can be used to secure last hits, whether from range or timing it with your regular attack.<h4>Bristleback</h4> Use your passive ability Bristleback to your advantage; anticipate enemy attacks and turn your back on them, so that you can reduce as much damage as you can. 
<br/>Please note that you should not turn your back towards projectiles flying towards you, but the original damage source.<br/>An early ability point on this ability during the laning phase can help you stay in the lane a while longer, especially if you are having trouble against attacks.<h4>Warpath</h4>Even if your enemies can easily defend against you with a Magic Wand, you can still heavily damage them with Warpath; as long as you're stacking your spells against them, the bonus damage will do its job.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Centaur Warrunner is an aggressive tank who excels when he is placed in the middle of fights. He reflects damage with his passive ability Return, while stunning and attacking the area around him with Hoof Stomp and Double Edge. Unlike other tanks, Centaur Warrunner sacrifices some durability in exchange for damage output, and may have a hard time recovering if the early game does not go well.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky early game to late game<br/>Can be useful to the team without large amounts of gold/items, but also benefits greatly from any gold he can get.<br/>Can gank very effectively.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Countered by lifesteal.<br/>Low mana.<br/>Low damage in the late game.<br/>Vulnerable to enemy abilities which remove a percentage of health or kill at a certain health threshold.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Centaur Warrunner is usually played solo in the off-lane. However, with a support who has hard disables (such as Earthshaker or Lion) he can absolutely dominate the safe-lane and potentially get several kills.<br/>Centaur Warrunner can also semi-jungle if the lane is going badly.<br/>Centaur's actual damage is average at best in the early game, with slow attack speed and only one damaging ability that hurts himself as well. However, Return can do crippling damage to the enemy team if they choose to heavily harass him.<br/>Centaur's late-game damage is entirely dependent upon how much Strength he has. If he ends up with over 200 strength (achieved by items such as Heart of Tarrasque and Armlet of Mordiggian) then he can deal frightening amounts of damage.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Hoof Stomp</h4>With a Blink Dagger, Hoof Stomp can be used as an initiation ability.<br/>When trying to land Hoof Stomp on fleeing enemies, get in front of their path if possible. Most opponents will outrun the stun during the cast time if they are already on the edge of the radius.<br/>Hoof Stomp has a long cast animation, and can be cancelled by the player or by enemies.<h4>Double Edge</h4>Centaur cannot deny himself with Double Edge.<br/>As Double Edge affects all enemies in a small radius around the target, it is very effective when taking on tight clusters of enemies. This includes jungle creeps, lane creeps, large amounts of enemy illusions, or multiple melee heroes trying to gang up on you.<br/>It is generally not a good idea to use or skill into this ability until you have a Heart of Tarrasque, allowing you to quickly heal from the damage you deal to yourself.<br/>Using Double Edge against enemies with unusually high magic resistance, such as Anti-Mage or Pudge, is not recommended, as it ends up hurting you more than it hurts the enemy.<h4>Return</h4>Return is an extremely powerful ability and not to be underestimated. Although its most notable effect is greatly increasing damage against enemies that try to gank Centaur in the late game, even at lower levels it can completely shut down heroes with high damage and low health.<br/>To force a tower to attack you and utilize Return, issue an attack command upon an enemy hero when in range (even one in another lane). This trick also works to aggravate lane creeps in order to push.<h4>Stampede</h4>Stampede's effect is global. Keep an eye on allies and enemies across the map to use it when needed.<br/>Stampede can be used offensively to allow you and your team to quickly initiate a teamfight, or chase down enemies trying to run away.<br/>Stampede can be used defensively to help allies escape a bad situation.<br/>Stampede only affects enemies once for a relatively short duration, so in larger fights the skill may go totally awry. This means the initiation must be careful and planned, with a chosen initiator, as with other fights (more than not, possibly Centaur himself).<br/>In the late-game, if Centaur has the right items, Stampede can do upwards of 600 damage to every enemy hero affected by it (before reductions). This means that Centaur Warrunner or his teammates should try to trample over all enemy heroes if possible, as this can result in a whopping 3000 damage to the enemy team.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Chaos Knight is a powerful strength hero dealing High Physical DPS that smashes his foes with straight, but powerful hits due to his Chaos Strike. Chaos Bolt is a luck-base spell that makes it hard to use, and he can close the gap with his enemies through Reality Rift. Phantasm has long recharge time, it would be recommended to time your ultimate for teamfights only. Chaos Knight requires adequate farming and an aggressive mindset to trample enemy Heroes. Once enough farming, he can overpower the late game with lots of Physical DPS with his Illusions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Good movement speed.<br/>Great late game.<br/>Can be aggressive in early and mid game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very RNG reliant.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Very tempting for enemy heroes.<br/>Highly reliant on his ultimate.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>In most situations, max Chaos Bolt and Reality Rift first, since the critical damage from your Chaos Strike is negligible in the early game.<br/>Always activate your Armlet of Mordiggian before using your ultimate, since the illusions also gain bonuses from it.<br/>Sange and Yasha is sub-optimal even for ganking CK, better of finishing  Heaven's Halber if you have the mana.<br/>If you manage to farm a Manta Style you gain two additional albeit somewhat weaker illusions that serve to wreck havoc among enemy ranks, Manta Style illusions much like Phantasm and rune illusions are pulled to your target with Reality Rift. You can often use this to block your target in a swarm of illusions they will not be able to escape from. The ultimate orb from Manta Style also boosts your mana pool just enough to allow you to cast illusions together with your ultimate ability.<br/>It is not entirely advisable to pick Chaos Knight against enemies that can easily clear illusions such as Medusa, Lion, Pugna owning to the fact that they can clear illusions regardless of their stats and given that your illusions are produced by your ultimate ability with a rather long cooldown you cannot afford to have them destroyed easily like Naga Siren, Terrorblade and Phantom Lancer who can produce illusions much more frequently.<br/>You may also want to be careful against an enemy that drains mana such as Quas Wex focused Invoker. Given Chaos Knight's dismal mana pool and intelligence gain Invoker's EMP can completely drain him of mana even in later stages of the game and without his active abilities Chaos Knight is not nearly as potent.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Chaos Bolt</h4>Although Chaos Bolt's damage is average, it's not to be underestimated. a lucky strike of 275 damage can be the difference between killing or failing to kill an enemy.<br/> Chaos Bolt, like  and  is easy to predict and disjoint, even easier due to Chaos Knight's poor cast animation. Try to use it as close to an enemy as possible if they have a way to dodge it.
<br/>Unlike Sven and Wraith King however, Chaos Knight can use Reality Rift to get in melee range of an enemy and make it a lot harder to disjoint your stun.<br/>Due to the unreliability of the spell, it makes Chaos Knight a poor initiator if he is in the field of vision of the enemy, and it is generally better to let your allies initiate the battle. If you are roaming, try to surprise and ambush your enemies, or use a Smoke of Deceit to increase your odds of landing the spell.<br/>At level 1, Chaos Bolt has a guaranteed one second stun duration, while it only attains a guaranteed two second stun duration at level 4. As such, it may be prudent to either leave Chaos Bolt at level 1 or rush it to level 4 to get the most out of the spell.<h4>Reality Rift</h4>While ganking in the early-mid game, use Reality Rift to get close to the enemy, then hit him once with your bonus damage and use Chaos Bolt to stun. If you are lucky, you could even get more than two hits while he is stunned.<br/> Reality Rift will reduce your target's armor by a flat value, making your auto attacks stronger overall.
<br/>Due to being a flat value, this reduction falls off late game.<br/>Illusions benefit from the armor reduction.<br/>This ability will place you and your target at a random position between the distance of both characters. This can result in Chaos Knight and his target becoming trapped within trees or in elevated terrain.<br/>Reality Rift will not only teleport Chaos Knight, but any illusions active when the ability is cast, including illusions from Phantasm. Consider this before using this ability.<br/>A level 4 Reality Rift is usually much better than a level 4 Chaos Bolt, as the reduction in cooldown makes it a viable chasing skill.<h4>Chaos Strike</h4> Since Chaos Strike has only 12% chance to proc, it is an unreliable form of damage. In comparison to other critical passives, such as 's , it has a lower chance of occurring but also comes with 65% lifesteal on each proc.
<br/>Against enemies that can easily kite Chaos Knight, you should focus on his other abilities rather than Chaos Strike. Also, if there is uncontested farm in lane skip Chaos Strike until level 11.<h4>Phantasm</h4>If you know for sure a fight is about to start, it's sometimes better to use your ultimate before it even starts off. The illusions have a very long duration and if you can find a good target to Reality Rift it can immediately turn a fight in your favor. Be mindful not to use it under enemy vision as they may immediately back away.<br/>Also, if your enemies have huge teamfight AOEs, they may be specifically waiting for you to cast Phantasm in the middle of the fight to jump on you.<br/>However, if all their abilities are meant to counter your army, it could be wise to keep it until they've blown some of them on different targets.<br/>If that would be the case, it could be safer to use your illusions only to push towers, keeping your hero and the rest of your team safely behind. The illusions long duration should even enable you to split push a bit to make counter the enemy's teamfight strategy.<br/>Your illusions pack a huge punch. They will automatically attack whoever you're pulling with Reality Rift. This target may instantly blow up. Don't forget to micro-manage your illusions while that target is dead and Rift is on cooldown. The same is true if you're dead. If you're confident with your micro-management skills, the best strategy is probably to send one after every enemy hero, similarly to Spectre's Haunt or try killing off supports, and against their buildings if you still have some left to spare.<br/> Phantasm has a very long cooldown. It is generally unwise to use it as a last-ditch effort when you're about to die since it would still be on cooldown well after you've respawned. However, like  and  it does provide a short instant of invulnerability that can help you disjoint spells, such as 's .
<br/>The potential to disjoint spells can have an incredible impact on teamfights and the game overall, allowing you and your illusions to survive for longer and deal more damage.<br/>Phantasm boasts the most powerful illusions in the game, creating an army that can boost Chaos Knight's damage output for up to 400%. When used in conjunction with Reality Rift and Chaos Bolt it is often possible to destroy the target before they get a chance for retaliation. Given that your illusions do full damage and are far more durable than illusions produced by any other hero always remember that even if your main hero dies your illusions still pose a very serious threat.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Clockwerk is a tanky initiator and ganker built to isolate and separate enemies. His array of disables and nukes provide strong crowd control in any situation, allowing him to greatly disrupt the enemy. Rocket Flare provides distant scouting vision, and Hookshot allows Clockwerk to initiate from extreme distances. He specializes in trapping and zoning out enemies with Power Cogs, allowing him and his team to pick off single heroes. With Blade Mail, his core item, Clockwerk reflects damage and forces enemies to risk their lives by attacking him, or entering deeper into his team formation to find different targets. His abilities require good positioning and aim, which can be daunting for newer players. Clockwerk's damage scales badly into the late game, where his purpose will be limited to initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky, super long range initiator.<br/>Powerful area control.<br/>Effective ganker.<br/>Good scouting vision.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low damage in the late game.<br/>Requires good aim.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Clockwerk's main purpose is to force enemies to fight him one on one inside his Power Cogs, where Battery Assault and Blade Mail gives him an advantage.<br/>Clockwerk has very strong initiation abilities, but his damage scale off greatly the longer a game goes due to enemies' mana and HP pools getting larger. As such, he is most effective in the early- and mid-game where he can get ganks off and secure map control for his team to gain an early advantage.<br/>While he has good base strength and impressive strength growth, Clockwerk suffers from poor base agility, meaning that he is quite vulnerable to physical damage if he does not get any armor items.<br/>Clockwerk's caster-oriented skill set means that he needs a source of mana regeneration in order to be effective. Due to all this and his strong initiation spells, Clockwerk benefits most from building items that give him survivability, mobility and mana.<br/>Clockwerk can be effective in the early to mid-game even without many items.<br/>In most cases, Clockwerk is played as an off-laner, as his spells allow him to harass the enemy while also providing a measure of survivability. As well, he can be very powerful with early levels, becoming a strong roamer and ganker once he hits level 6.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Battery Assault</h4>Battery Assault works best if Clockwerk can single out and lock a lone enemy inside Power Cogs. As the shrapnel hits random targets within a certain radius of Clockwerk, removing random targets from the equation allows Clockwerk to inflict all of the damage on a single enemy, often resulting in a kill.<br/>Activate Battery Assault before initiating with Hookshot or Power Cogs to save time and maximize damage.<br/>Battery Assault is a very strong chasing spell that works best if Clockwerk has more movement speed than his target. The mini-stun from the shrapnel will force enemies to stop each time they are hit, drastically impeding their attempts to flee. This allows Clockwerk to guaranteed slow an enemy down for the full duration of the spell after getting within range to land one mini-stun, and gives any nearby allies time to catch up.<br/>Never underestimate the amount of damage that Battery Assault can deal to a lone target in the early game. With just two levels in the ability, it is possible to run down and kill enemies by yourself in the laning stage if you can catch them away from other units.<br/>Battery Assault will not hit invisible units. Therefore, it is highly recommended to carry Dust of Appearance or Sentry Wards if you are ganking a hero with invisibility spells or items.<br/>Heroes with long cast or attack animations (over 0.6 seconds), will be continuously interrupted by Battery Assault, assuming there are no other units in range.<br/>To interrupt a channeling enemy, simply walk next to them while Battery Assault is active.<h4>Power Cogs</h4>Power Cogs is a powerful harass and escape spell in the laning stage. Against melee carries, Clockwerk can easily get within range to shock them with the cogs when they approach the creeps to get a last-hit, destroying their HP and mana at little cost to himself.<br/>Erect Power Cogs as a defensive barrier when being ganked. The pushback will give Clockwerk enough time to get away.<br/>Power Cogs together with Battery Assault can be thought of as a way to disable dangerous enemies. By pinning down a target inside the barrier with Clockwerk, Battery Assault can mini-stun and damage on the target for several seconds.<br/>Power Cogs can be destroyed in two enemy attacks unless they are level 4. If you are attempting to lock down an enemy and don't have level 4 cogs, it can be beneficial to simply block the enemy's path with the cogs from outside rather than locking them in, as the shock can provide additional damage and stun, and the enemy will be forced to destroy at least two cogs in order to go in the direction they wish to.<br/> Used as an initiating tool, Power Cogs can greatly impede enemies' movements whether they are outside or within the barrier. 
<br/>Placing the cogs in a certain area can inflict several of the enemy with the shock and prevent them from moving in that direction, which can be used to cut off escapes or deter advance.<br/> Locking down targets within the barrier allows your team to hit them with AoE nukes like , , , , and so on. 
<br/> Beware that the same vulnerability applies to Clockwerk. Even though Clockwerk can destroy his own cogs, the time it takes to do so will also allow enemy nukers to deal much damage to him.
<br/>This can be countered if Clockwerk uses Blade Mail at the right time.<br/>Remember that Power Cogs can be destroyed by Clockwerk in one hit, which is useful for escape when a gank or initiation goes wrong.<br/>When ganking lone targets from behind, it can be useful to utilize Power Cogs' shock rather than locking down an enemy inside. The cogs can deal additional damage and reduce the enemy's mana, and block off the enemy's retreat. The shock can also be used as an additional disable to stun the enemy for a short amount of time.<br/>The pushback can be used to displace enemies over impassable terrain, such as pushing them onto or over a cliff. This is especially common when used in and around the Roshan Pit.<br/>The pushback stuns enemies, which will interrupt channeling spells or items if Battery Assault and Hookshot are on cooldown.<br/>Be very careful about when and where you use Power Cogs, as they will impede allied movement as well as that of enemies. Deploying Power Cogs at the wrong moment or place can trap teammates or hinder pursuit against enemies.<br/>Clockwerk usually starts with a point in Power Cogs since it allows him to trap his creep wave inside the cogs so the creeps meet close enough to his tower so that he can't be zoned out by the enemy supports. If you're really desperate for some exp, you can even trap the first wave twice, then trap the second or third wave...<br/>One point in Power Cogs is usually enough for the early game, and can be leveled last after that.<h4>Rocket Flare</h4>Rocket Flare can be used to last hit creeps in lane, and to break Clarity and Healing Salve on enemy heroes from long range.<br/>Use Rocket Flare's global range to pick off retreating enemies.<br/>Use Rocket Flare to give Clockwerk vision for Hookshot.<br/>During the early game, your skill points are better spent on your other spells, so one or two levels of Rocket Flare is enough.<br/>Try to use Rocket Flare where your team has little or no vision.<br/>Rocket Flare's area damage is useful for pushing lanes across the map.<br/>If you have advance notice that your team intends to gank in another lane, try to send a rocket at the enemy to add your own nuke damage as well.<br/>Besides the lingering flying vision given over its destination, it also provides vision as it travels, so overshooting the rocket can allow you to scout out more area.<br/>Never hesitate to use your rocket to check behind treelines where you suspect the enemy may be, and be sure to occasionally check Roshan Pit if the entire enemy team is missing.<h4>Hookshot</h4>Hookshot is the longest ranged initiating ability in the game, allowing Clockwerk to almost instantly stun and close the distance with any enemy that he has a clear line of engagement towards.<br/>Be wary of obstructions in Hookshot's path. Make sure Clockwerk is not behind any allies, and that there are no neutral creep camps in its path.<br/>Keep your finger on the Stop hotkey (S by default) to immediately cancel Hookshot's cast animation if it looks like you're going to miss.<br/>Take advantage of Hookshot's long cast range to initiate on an enemy who doesn't even know that you're in the same part of the map.<br/> Use Power Cogs immediately after Hookshot to lock the enemy in place. 
<br/>The stun duration allows Clockwerk to even move a short distance away before dropping the Power Cogs if he chooses to block off their escape route and push them back with the shock.<br/> While Hookshot is very powerful for initiating on lone enemies, its long cast range also allows Clockwerk to jump on enemies in the rear line of teamfights. This can be useful for disrupting the enemy's supports and preventing them from effectively participating, as well as for getting in position to split the battlefield with Power Cogs.
<br/>In the same idea, it can be just as valuable to jump on that squishy enemy glass cannon ( Sniper, Clinkz...) that sits behind his team's front-liners rather than let them dish out their damage.<br/>Hookshot to allied heroes, creeps, and neutral creeps to quickly escape a bad situation.<br/>Hookshot can stun enemies through spell immunity. As such, it can be used as a last resort if an enemy has activated spell immunity and is trying to teleport away.<br/>If you suspect the enemy is in the Roshan Pit, a Hookshot will usually hit a target in the cramped space, surprising the enemy team without giving away your intentions with Rocket Flare.<br/>In the late game with Aghanim's Scepter, players with good aim can use Hookshot as a method of travel, jumping across the map constantly.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Doom is a versatile carry who can become a powerful late-game threat due to his ability to quickly farm with Devour, his strong nuking power, and his ultimate Doom that lets him disable an enemy for at least 15 seconds. His skill set and fast farming potential allows him to be built in any number of ways to meet the enemy threat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Doom's ultimate is one of the strongest single target disables in the game.<br/>Devour boosts gold income and grants Doom access to jungle creep abilities.<br/>High base STR and high STR growth gives Doom naturally high HP and base damage.<br/>Potent scaling damage-over-time debuff from Infernal Blade.<br/>Versatile hero that can be built in a variety of different ways, as either a support or core.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable to ranged heroes<br/>Very vulnerable to slows<br/>Low starting base armor<br/>Little to no armor increase through stats<br/>Has low intelligence<br/>Has low base agility and low agility gain<br/>Has a 2.0 BAT (the lowest in the game), with low agility (base and gain), making the use of his nuke very unreliable<br/>Nuke is considered a normal right-click, meaning it can miss if the opponent hero has evasion.<br/>Can't properly tank without his 2nd skill<br/>Any other proper tank can be a better aura carry, if they get equal or more farm than Doom<br/>Vulnerable to early harassment<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One of Doom's greatest weaknesses is his minimal base armor and extremely low agility, making him very vulnerable to physical damage despite being a strength hero, and reducing his physical damage output potential. As well, he has the lowest base attack time in the game, meaning that his attack speed is extremely slow unless boosted by items. Therefore, he must build armor items in order to survive in teamfights, and attack speed items in order to be able to deal any damage to enemies.<br/> Due to his Devour ability, Doom is a good farmer who can quickly get the gold to purchase many strong core items to alleviate his weaknesses. His ability to obtain gold and experience using this ability also allows him to greatly diversify and play many different roles depending on what his team needs.
<br/>In general, Doom is best played as a safe lane carry, as his ability to farm can allow him to get numerous powerful items that give him strong teamfight presence. The degree to which he can carry is almost unlimited, and can be chosen depending on which stage of the game it is best to end on based on the enemy team's lineup.<br/>Doom's ability to instantly kill creeps with Devour makes him a respectable jungler, as he can farm neutral camps relatively quickly with the ability. He can also rotate with any abilities he has gained through consuming creeps to gank the enemy as needed.<br/>With a few points in Scorched Earth, Doom can be a very strong off-laner, as the spell can give him the mobility and survivability he needs to stay alive. Devour allows him to consume creeps, both enemy and neutral, to guarantee gold and experience gain, while Infernal Blade allows him to inflict surprising amounts of damage against enemy supports that attempt to trade hits with him.<br/>Doom can also play a utility or support role, as his ultimate gives him a way to contribute to a teamfight regardless of how much farm he has. Devour allows him to obtain gold without being given major farm priority, meaning that even if given the priority of a hard support he can get gold to buy items that help him or his team.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Devour</h4>Devour allows Doom to instantly kill a target non-friendly creep, gaining the gold and experience bounty immediately and then bonus gold after consuming it.<br/>Devour is Doom's strongest early-game spell, as it accelerates his gold and experience gain, giving him an early advantage. It should generally be the first spell that is maxed out, as it allows Doom to obtain early levels and fast core items if left alone by the enemy team.<br/>Assuming it is always used when off cooldown, Devour increases Doom's GPM by 21/50/90/150 (90/130/186/270 with talent) - not including the bounty from the creep it is used on. For comparison, Midas gives 132 GPM.<br/> The ability to steal  abilities is very strong, as Doom gains both the active and passive abilities. This allows him to choose a creep that gives him the most benefits depending on what opponents he is facing or what he needs in-lane. Good Doom play requires understanding each neutral creep's strengths and how they can be best utilized depending on the situation; certain creeps are very powerful in the laning stage or give an edge while jungling, while others are powerful for initiating or disabling enemies in fights, and still others provide auras or can place buffs that greatly benefit the whole team in the late game.
<br/>If you are going to jungle at the start of the game, a Satyr Tormenter should be first priority to use your Devour on, as its Unholy Aura greatly increases your survivability and regeneration and makes up for Doom's low attack speed and armor. This is not recommended if you are going to lane, however, as the aura pushes the lane and either makes you more vulnerable to ganks or hurts your farm, while Shockwave uses too much mana to be spammed in lane for harass.<br/>A very good choice for at early game is to devour a Hill Troll Priest as it is useful if you are either going to jungle or lane. In lane it provides you and your lane partner much higher mana regen (even higher than the bonus Crystal Maiden provides with a level 3 or lower Arcane Aura), allowing you to continuously spam your abilities. In addition, its Heal can allow you to heal without using consumables (this is rather inefficient due to the longer cast time it has when used by Doom).<br/>If you intent to gank often or simply want to score early kills, good choices for Devour targets would be the Ghost, Centaur Conqueror, Hellbear Smasher or the Satyr Banisher. The Ghost's Frost Attack can in coalition with an Orb of Venom greatly slow the enemy; provided you continue to hit them. A Centaur Conqueror's War Stomp can potentially stun the enemy for a reasonably lengthy duration and score your team a kill, but its small radius and big delay when cast by Doom makes it very unreliable and requires good positioning to be successfully used. The Satyr Banisher's Purge is a very strong ganking ability, as it not only greatly slows the enemy and has an extremely low cooldown (3 seconds), but it also dispels many buffs. A Hellbear Smasher's Thunder Clap is often times more reliable than War Stomp and its Swiftness Aura allows you to deal more blows, but it pushes your lane once the gank is over so you should quickly replace the abilities with others.<br/>Mud Golems are also possible choices, as they give you a reliable but somewhat weak nuke and stun in Hurl Boulder, although you should mind the large cooldown. Their greatest strength, however, is in Shard Split, which spawns two Doomlings on your death, both of which have the Hurl Boulder ability. If the enemy is weakened enough and they do not dispose of the Doomlings quickly, you may get your revenge from beyond the grave.<br/>Devouring a Kobold Foreman for Speed Aura is also a good choice because it grants a movement speed aura that allows Doom and nearby allies to gank more effectively or outmaneuver the enemy team during fights.<br/>Obviously, the best choice for late game is the Alpha Wolf, which not only increases the right-click damage of your entire team with Packleader's Aura, but it also gives you a Critical Strike, both of which greatly amplify your strength as a carry.<br/>Keep in mind, Doom must digest any creep that has been devoured before he can use Devour again, even if it has come off cooldown. Doom digests creeps at a rate of 20 HP per second, based on the HP of the creep when it was eaten, so at higher levels of Devour it is often necessary to damage a creep somewhat before devouring it.<br/>Beware that you get the bonus gold at the end of the digestion period, and that you lose the debuff upon death, so if you are killed while you are digesting a creep you do not gain the bonus gold. This means that it is a good habit to work down creeps in order to cut down the digestion period, as getting ganked by the enemy can cost you more than just unreliable gold upon death.<h4>Scorched Earth</h4>Scorched Earth increases Doom's movement speed while simultaneously giving him HP regen and magical burn damage in an area around him.<br/>Due to the amount of health regeneration and damage it provides, Scorched Earth is a good ability to max out early in a match. The self-heal can greatly increase Doom's survivability in engagements, which in turn helps to keep him alive and active on the map rather than retreating to base to heal or respawning.<br/>Regardless of leveling priority, at least one early level of Scorched Earth is recommended, as the movement speed boost is the same at all levels. The extra speed can be crucial in the early game to chase enemies down or outrun pursuers.<br/>Due to its instant cast time, Scorched Earth allows Doom to activate it without breaking stride, which can help him to chase or escape without stopping to cast the spell.<br/>If jungling, Scorched Earth can give a measure of additional damage output and HP regen. This can be additionally powerful if the Dark Troll Summoner from the Troll Camp has been previously devoured, as the summoned Skeleton Warriors also gain the HP regen from the spell.<br/>Scorched Earth is a strong candidate for maxing out early, after Devour. In early game engagements, the burn damage and heal can allow Doom to efficiently trade attacks with the enemy, allowing him to be aggressive in the laning stage.<br/>Be very mindful of Scorched Earth's extremely long cooldown. While it costs comparatively little mana to cast, the long cooldown means that using it to farm leaves you vulnerable once the spell's effects end, as you no longer have a movement speed boost or HP regen spell available for some time. Try to only use Scorched Earth when absolutely necessary, as the mobility and survivability it grants can make a huge difference if you are ganked.<h4>Infernal Blade</h4>Infernal Blade is an attack modifier that allows Doom to inflict a damage-over time burn on enemies he attacks, damaging them for a portion of their maximum health. The initial strike with the spell also mini-stuns its target.<br/>Because Infernal Blade's damage is expressed as a percentage of the target's maximum HP, it scales into the late game, reliably dealing damage no matter how much health the enemy has. However, due to Doom's need to farm and stay alive in the early game, it is wise to avoid leveling Infernal Blade too much until after both Devour and Scorched Earth are maxed out.<br/>Due to its ability to mini-stun targets upon attack, an early value point in Infernal Blade can greatly benefit Doom and his team. Stopping an enemy channeled spell or interrupting a Town Portal Scroll can halt powerful enemy spells or prevent them from escaping or reinforcing their teammates.<br/>Keep in mind that despite its low mana cost, Infernal Blade has a very long cooldown at low levels, limiting its damage output. As well, Doom's low base intelligence means that even casting the spell a few times in the early game can greatly drain his mana pool, preventing him from casting his other spells as needed. Try to avoid using Infernal Blade profligately, and cast it only when necessary to either inflict harass damage against lane opponents or when the nuke damage is needed for a kill attempt.<br/>As a castable attack modifier, Doom can manually inflict enemies with Infernal Blade during the laning stage without drawing creep aggro. Even though the percentage-based fraction of damage does not do much, the flat damage portion is much stronger in the laning stage, allowing Doom to inflict powerful harass damage against enemies should he get within range to trade auto-attacks with them.<br/>When casting Infernal Blade during a fight, try to utilize the mini-stun as a disable if possible. Rather than trying to inflict the debuff on an enemy at the earliest opportunity, it may be wise to avoid stun-stacking if an ally has already disabled the enemy with a leading stun. Try to work down the enemy with regular attacks while they are disabled, and then cast Infernal Blade in order to impede them once they are able to act.<h4>Doom</h4>Doom is often considered the most powerful single-target disable in the game, as it silences and mutes its target for at least 15 seconds. Used on the proper enemy, it can convert any 5-vs.-5 fight into an uneven 4-vs.-5 fight.<br/>Doom is an extremely powerful ganking spell, since it prevents the target from casting spells or using items, rendering them completely helpless. If Doom can be used to pick off one of the enemy's strongest heroes alone, it can give Doom's team a numerical advantage even before a teamfight happens, discouraging the enemy from engaging at all.<br/>Be mindful that Doom's ultimate has a 0.5 second cast animation, longer than his standard cast animation of 0.3 seconds. This can allow particularly reactive enemies to dodge or evade Doom as he attempts to cast the spell, so the element of surprise is very important in allowing Doom to get the spell off. If possible, try to get a teammate with strong initiating abilities and items disable key enemy targets first, so that they cannot react to Doom coming within range to cast his ultimate.<br/>The strongest counters to Doom are Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb, which can cause the ultimate to be entirely wasted or even reflected back to Doom himself. If possible, try to break an enemy Linken's Sphere with a cheap unit-targeted ability first, either from an item or a creep ability obtained through Devour. Teammates can also help Doom by using their cheap unit-targeted abilities to break a Linken's Sphere for him.<br/>In teamfights, Doom should generally be targeted on the biggest threat on the enemy team, as preventing them from participating in a teamfight can greatly tip the odds in your team's favor. However, the biggest threat may not always be the enemy's hard carry, so use your best judgment.<br/>The target that you choose for Doom is extremely important, as the huge 15 second duration can render spell-dependent heroes such as Zeus or Lina absolutely useless. As well, if you can catch an enemy hero carrying key support items like Mekansm or Pipe of Insight, you can prevent those items from being used during the subsequent fight, all the more so if they are being carried by a hero that has powerful teamfight contribution spells, killing two birds with one stone.<br/>Beware that when enemies drop below 25% of their maximum HP, they can be denied by their teammates, preventing Doom and his team from gaining the gold or experience bounty. Additionally, Doom is not guaranteed to kill enemies that break off from a fight, and they can potentially limp away at low health and survive. If the goal is to kill the Doomed target, try to prevent them from escaping in order to prevent any of the two situations from happening.<br/>Conversely, remember that once an enemy is Doomed, they lose much of their ability to contribute during an engagement. If the goal is to win a teamfight, the Doomed target can be ignored and their teammates should be focused on and killed, allowing Doom's team to kill the Doomed enemy at their leisure and take map objectives once the rest of the enemy team is defeated.<br/>When considering purchasing Aghanim's Scepter, keep in mind that it is best purchased only if the break can be utilized effectively. If the enemy lineup has strong threatening heroes with troublesome passive abilities such as Phantom Assassin, Bristleback and Spectre, applying a break on them can greatly reduce the threat they pose to your team. However, not building an Aghanim's Scepter lets you use the gold and inventory slot to build a different item, which may counter enemy heroes in a better way.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dragon Knight is a durable front-line carry who can transform into a dragon and wipe out enemies with ranged projectile attacks. His heavy armor and regeneration from Dragon Blood makes him tankier than most carries, especially in the early game. If his team gains the upper hand, Dragon Knight's presence often ensures continued domination with little chance of enemy comeback. With a Shadow Blade, Dragon Knight can make a decent ganker due to Dragon Tail and its long stun duration. While resilient, Dragon Knight's damage output depends heavily on his dragon form, and can be rather useless if caught while it's on cooldown. Dragon Knight is also quite slow, and has no mobility skills.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Heavy armor against physical attacks.<br/>High health regeneration.<br/>Instant cast animations.<br/>Strong splash damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow movement speed.<br/>Very dependent on his ultimate.<br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Dragon Knight is one of the few heroes with no cast time on his abilities, so abilities can be cast in between attacks on the backswing animation.<br/>Creep stacking is a good tactic for Dragon Knight, as his ultimate will clear camps quickly.<br/>Dragon Knight has a quick, clean attack animation, making last hitting fairly easy (especially with a Quelling Blade).<br/>With any source of lifesteal, Dragon Knight rarely needs to return to the fountain.<br/>In the early game, enemies teams may choose to ignore Dragon Knight during teamfights, due to his low damage.<br/>Dragon Knight's item build varies depending on what he's facing. Good players must analyze enemies' items to make an informed decision.<br/>Despite being tanky against physical damage, Dragon Knight has no defenses against magical and pure damage. Don't overestimate his tankiness against a mixed lineup of heroes.<br/>Like several other carries, Dragon Knight relies heavily on Black King Bar to keep himself from being disabled in teamfights.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Breathe Fire</h4>Breathe Fire can be used to farm and harass in lane, especially if Dragon Knight has a Soul Ring.<br/>Breathe Fire is useful as an early game nuke, being your damage source until you can unleash heavy auto attacks.<br/>Breathe Fire reduces enemies attack damage.<h4>Dragon Tail</h4>Dragon Tail is the longest (guaranteed) level 1 single target stun in the game. Mirana's Sacred Arrow can stun up to 5 seconds at level 1, but must travel at least 1500 range and as such is difficult to hit with.<br/>Dragon Tail scales poorly. One or two levels is often enough to fulfill its primary stun purposes.<br/>Dragon Tail is great for ganking, especially if you have Shadow Blade.<br/>Dragon Tail's cast range increases as you transform yourself into a Dragon.<h4>Dragon Blood</h4>Max it first as it can keep you alive longer. It is a must skill when playing in offlane.
<br/>Restores 180/360/540/720 (360/720/1080/1440 with Talents) health in one minute.<h4>Elder Dragon Form</h4>Despite its long duration, make sure Elder Dragon Form is always ready before a teamfight. Without it, Dragon Knight is easily kited.<br/>Elder Dragon Form changes attack range from melee to ranged. Keep this in mind when building items as it also changes the effect of items like Manta Style, damage block, bash chance and cleave.<br/>The Dragons' corrosive breath affects towers, easily taking them down.<br/>Use the Splash damage from the Level 2 Red Dragon to clean waves and stacked camps. A Helm of the Dominator is usually bought for this job.<br/>Frost Breath and Corrosive Breath are not unique attack modifiers, so they are stackable with items granting unique attack modifiers.<br/>The splash damage will not trigger lifesteal.<br/>However, if the attack modifier increases the attack damage, it will affect splash (both Corrosive Breath and Frost Breath are applied to all units damaged by splash), and so does critical strikes. Splash damage is also affected by damage manipulation.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Earth Spirit is one of the strongest disabling heroes in the game, possessing a stun, silence and slow in all of his basic abilities, allowing him to combo his abilities based on the needs of his allies and how he wants to affect his enemies. By judiciously using his spells at the right time and in the right situation, he can inflict the enemy with powerful crowd control effects.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very dangerous roaming presence.<br/>Performs role well without items.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Requires precise positioning and timing.<br/>Mediocre lane presence if not playing aggressively.<br/>Somewhat level dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Due to the high potential impact of his spells, Earth Spirit is a relatively farm-independent hero, and can contribute greatly to ganks and teamfights with few to no items. He is best played as a utility initiator that can be useful without items but increases greatly in effectiveness with farm.<br/>Earth Spirit has little single-target physical damage, and his spells require the use of Stone Remnants in order to be effective. As such, it is difficult to farm with him, so he should get his gold by being active and getting kills and assists in teamfights and ganks.<br/>Positioning is key with Earth Spirit; this hero is adept at initiating, counter-initiating and running down fleeing foes. All of his spells allow him to disable enemies in some form or another, so being within range to cast his spells can allow him to turn the tide of any teamfight.<br/> Earth Spirit can generally be played in numerous roles, depending on what is needed by his team.
<br/>Most commonly, Earth Spirit is played as a solo off-laner, as he possesses survivability due to being a strength hero and has an escape in Rolling Boulder. Getting solo experience in the off-lane allows him to get fast early levels, which in turn allows him to use his abilities to devastate his opponents and greatly disrupt the enemy's safe lane. He can then transition into roaming and ganking with his spells.<br/>As a roamer, Earth Spirit can use his wide array of disables to set up kills on enemies in their lanes. While he will not get much farm or experience, he can appear without warning in any enemy lane and disable enemies for kills, giving his teammates strong lane advantages.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Boulder Smash</h4>Boulder Smash is a powerful utility spell that allows Earth Spirit to forcibly re-position a unit while dealing damage, or launch a Stone Remnant to stun and deal damage over great distances.<br/>A successfully targeted Boulder Smash with a Stone Remnant is one of the longest-ranged and fastest-moving stuns in the game. You can use it for a variety of effects despite its mediocre damage, such as canceling an enemy's teleport from a safe distance (e.g. a Naga Siren who has cast Song of the Siren, a Tinker with Boots of Travel or a Nature's Prophet hidden inside Sprout) or interrupting enemy channeling spells without endangering yourself, such as Death Ward.<br/>Keep in mind, Boulder Smash can be cast on allies as well as enemies, not just Stone Remnants. It can be used to help an ally initiate, or to forcibly displace an enemy in a direction favorable to your team. However, keep in mind that a Boulder Smash cast on a unit has a relatively short travel distance and will not stun any enemies in its path. It also will not interrupt the targeted unit, so it won't cancel channeling spells this way.<br/>When ganking or solo-killing a target, it is often beneficial to keep Boulder Smash in reserve in case the target attempts to teleport out. Earth Spirit has limited physical damage output and his spells lack immediate nuking power, so holding on to your stun can allow you to prevent the target from easily escaping after being initiated on.<br/>As it does not interrupt channeling when cast on an ally, Boulder Smash can be used to re-position teammates who are channeling big ultimates in teamfights (such as Death Ward and Black Hole to put them in a better position whilst the spell remains in effect. On a smaller scale, it can be used to displace an ally who is channeling a Town Portal Scroll, making them harder to locate by the enemy and buying them time to escape.<h4>Rolling Boulder</h4>Rolling Boulder is a powerful mobility spell that allows Earth Spirit to initiate, escape, or simply re-position to cast his spells.<br/>Leveling up Rolling Boulder only decreases its cooldown, so it is best to only take one point in the ability in the early game for mobility, and spend your skill points on your other disables and nukes, which increase in damage and duration.<br/>When augmented by a Stone Remnant, Rolling Boulder increases Earth Spirit's travel speed and maximum distance, and inflicts a slow on the first enemy hero it collides with. Because the distance is fixed and the speed only changes upon hitting the Stone Remnant, it is best to place the remnant right on top of Earth Spirit, in order to minimize the travel time.<br/>By utilizing the delay on Rolling Boulder, it is possible to decrease the time required to execute a Remnant-augmented roll. Cast Rolling Boulder in the desired direction, and then place the Stone Remnant in Earth Spirit's path during the delay (remember that you can double-tap Stone Remnant), instead placing the Remnant and then casting Rolling Boulder.<br/>Remember that Rolling Boulder allows Earth Spirit to move up and down cliffs and through trees, so you can use it to pass over normally impassable terrain. However, keep in mind that getting disabled during the spell's 0.6 second delay will interrupt it, so be very careful about using it when fleeing enemies with stuns, roots or silences.<br/>When using Rolling Boulder to initiate on a target, good aim is absolutely mandatory. The boulder only stops when it connects with an enemy hero, so if you miss and overshoot, you may wind up in an extremely disadvantageous position.<br/>Remember that while you are rooted for the duration of Rolling Boulder, you may still use items (excluding Blink Dagger). For instance, Town Portal scrolls can be used without being interrupted, so they can be activated during the delay or roll, allowing Earth Spirit to start channeling an escape early and displace himself during the channeling.<br/> Depending on when and where in the roll the Stone Remnant is placed, Earth Spirit moves at a net rate of 500 or 762-1000.
<br/>Rolling without a Stone Remnant moves Earth Spirit 800 units in 1.6 (0.6 + 1) seconds, resulting in a net rate of 500 effective movement speed. Rolling into a Stone Remnant 949-950 distance from Earth Spirit's initial location moves him 1600 in 2.1 (0.6 + 1 + 0.5) seconds, resulting in a net rate of 762 effective movement speed. Rolling into a Stone Remnant 0-150 distance from Earth Spirit's initial location moves him 1600 in 1.6 (0.6 + 1) seconds, resulting in a net rate of 1000 effective ms.<h4>Geomagnetic Grip</h4>Geomagnetic Grip is an ally-targeted spell that allows Earth Spirit to pull an allied creep or Stone Remnant to his position.<br/>Because Geomagnetic Grip's silence duration does not scale that well, it is best skilled up only if the longer silence duration is necessary for countering specific enemies, or if the additional magical damage is needed.<br/>Remember that Geomagnetic Grip deals no damage unless a Stone Remnant is pulled. Therefore, if the aim is to deal damage, a remnant must be used.<br/>When using Stone Remnants to utilize Geomagnetic Grip's silence, remember that Stone Remnants have no collision boxes. Therefore if your aim is surprise, you can place the Stone Remnant in the enemy's fog of war (inside of trees, or on an elevated cliff) and then pull it to you to avoid alerting them when they see the remnant being placed.<br/>When upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, Geomagnetic Grip has great utility in saving allies who are being ganked by the enemy, as it can pull them to safety over terrain and regardless of the direction they are facing or intervening enemy units. As well, it will silence any enemies within melee range of your teammate, preventing them from casting mobility spells to pursue.<h4>Stone Remnant</h4>Stone Remnant allows Earth Spirit to place a remnant within a certain radius of himself, and then use it in combination with his spells.<br/>Stone Remnants are key to enhancing the effectiveness of all of Earth Spirit's spells. They should be treated as a resource more valuable than mana, as while abilities and items exist to replenish mana, none exist to increase the number of Stone Remnant charges available besides waiting for them to naturally replenish.<br/>When casting your spells to farm or disable enemies in fights, remember that you can use the same Stone Remnant more than once. The Stone Remnant that you pulled to you with Geomagnetic Grip to silence an enemy can then be used to stun a distant target with Boulder Smash, or quickly re-position yourself with Rolling Boulder.<br/>Stone Remnants persist on the field for up to 2 minutes, and ignore pathing and collision. If you are short on Stone Remnants but have plenty of mana, you can recycle them by moving old Stone Remnants to more advantageous positions using your spells. As well, Stone Remnants left over from previous teamfights can be improvised if another fight occurs in the same area.<br/>Double-clicking on the command to place a Stone Remnant (or ALT + ability hotkey if Quickcast and Smart Double Tap are enabled) will place a Stone Remnant directly in front of Earth Spirit. This can facilitate easier casting of Boulder Smash and Rolling Boulder, and give players more time to direct their attention at enemy targets as needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Earthshaker is a powerful spellcaster designed to repeatedly stun enemies. However, his naturally low mana requires careful management and selective use, especially during the early game. His Echo Slam allows him to wipe out large groups of enemies, making him an ideal pick against heroes like Chaos Knight, Meepo, Broodmother, or Phantom Lancer. Compared to intelligence supports, Earthshaker has a sizeable health pool. But compared to most strength heroes, Earthshaker is fairly vulnerable and can be easily killed if caught out of position.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Numerous stuns.<br/>Excellent initiation.<br/>Good early ganking.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/>Long cast animations.<br/>Easy to harass in lane.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Due to his costly abilities, Earthshaker needs good timing and game sense to be effective.<br/>In the early game, Earthshaker is very easy to harass in lane. Players should play conservatively except when setting up a gank with his allies.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fissure</h4>At 1500 range, Fissure is one of the longest ranged stuns in the game.<br/>Use Fissure to block off enemy retreat or reinforcements.
<br/>Earthshaker is exceptional at ganking the mid lane, because at a good angle, Fissure can completely block the enemy midlaner from running back to their tower.<br/>Keep your finger on the Stop hotkey (S by default) to immediately cancel the cast animation if it looks like you're going to miss.<br/>Fissure creates an impassable ridge and splits two adjacent heroes between the ridge.
<br/>Fissure is useful for separating a fleeing ally from a pursuing enemy. This requires practice, as it is quite common to misclick and wall off both heroes on the same side.<br/>The impassable terrain is effective in splitting the battlefield during a teamfight. However, improper use of Fissure can prevent melee carries from inflicting damage on or chasing the enemy.<br/>Fissure's long range can be used to snipe off retreating enemies.<br/>Fissure has a long cast animation and may be interrupted in a hectic fight.<h4>Enchant Totem</h4>Enchant Totem has a very long cast animation and can be interrupted,<br/>One of Enchant Totem's main roles is to stun enemy with  . It can be used as a mini-initiation ability with  or its  upgrade.
<br/>Beware of its long cast animation: Enemy may simply walk out of the Aftershock radius.<br/>Enchant Totem has a very low cooldown, allowing Earthshaker to repeatedly return to the fight during long engagements.<br/>The Enchant Totem buff lasts 14 seconds, meaning that it should be pre-cast before a fight to maximize Earthshaker's damage.<br/>Enchant Totem is useful for last hitting buildings. However, if the team's carry is around, Earthshaker should yield the last hit (and therefore extra gold) to them.<h4>Echo Slam</h4>For maximum damage, use Echo Slam around as many enemy units as possible.<br/>Use the Aftershock stun duration from Echo Slam to follow up with other abilities.<br/>It is not always best to use Echo Slam to initiate. Experienced players often stay back during fights, waiting until enemies are grouped up before jumping in.
<br/>That said, some team compositions are very dependent on Earthshaker to initiate. Use sensible judgment.<br/>A well placed Echo Slam is one of the few abilities that can turn around a badly losing game.<br/>There are certain positions that enemies will natually group up. This includes Roshan pit, the high ground around Tier 3 Towers, narrow paths such as river, places without vision such as uphills, or even at times when they are ganging up on a teammate.<h4>Items</h4>Starting items:Tango provides health regeneration in lane.<br/>Iron Branch gives basic stats and can be built into Magic Wand, also allows more regeneration from Tango.<br/>Clarity potions allow him to cast Fissure's more than once, since its mana cost is relatively high and Earthshaker's mana pool is small.<br/>Animal Courier should be purchased if there are no other supports on the team. However, he may need to sacrifice a few items, such as Gauntlets of Strength, or two Clarities, reducing his lane presence by a big deal.<br/>Infused Raindrop provides excellent protection against magical harassment, against which Earthshaker normally has no defense.<br/>Enchanted Mango provides extra health regen, also an extra mana source in a pinch for an extra Fissure.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Elder Titan is a very flexible hero who can provide great amounts of utility to his team through his abilities, depending on how he is built. He can use Astral Spirit to accrue great amounts of bonus damage and movement speed, and then take advantage of Natural Order to inflict that bonus damage on enemies when their defenses are reduced. He is also capable of disabling multiple enemy heroes at once with a combination of Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp, as well as set up strong slows and deal tremendous damage with Earth Splitter after landing a successful Echo Stomp.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Wide area disable.<br/>Anti-tank aura.<br/>Can deal high physical damage as a support.<br/>Good scouting ability.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Mediocre stat growths.<br/>Difficult to land spells.<br/>Low mana.<br/>Requires some micro-management.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>In general, due to being a strength melee hero, Elder Titan benefits greatly from building durability items. After increasing his tankiness, he can transition into carrying defensive auras and teamfight items, which can give his team an edge in fights.<br/> Depending on your team composition and level of play, Elder Titan's skills have differing priorities to max. Level Echo Stomp to increase the sleep's duration, making it easier for Elder Titan and his team to set up their own spells without disturbance. Astral Spirit provides the highest overall damage increase in a single spell, allowing Elder Titan to deal damage from the spirit passing through enemies as well as giving him bonus damage once it returns. Maxing Natural Order early massively increases the amount of damage enemies will take in engagements, allowing high damage dealers on Elder Titan's team to maximize their damage output.
<br/>If being built as a melee-range fighter, Elder Titan focuses on maxing out Astral Spirit and Natural Order, completely forgoing Echo Stomp and his ultimate to get four levels in both by level 8. By doing so, Elder Titan can cast Astral Spirit to maximize the amount of bonus damage and movement speed he gains by passing it through enemy units, and then engaging the enemy in direct combat to utilize the bonus damage and apply his Natural Order aura to enemies he is attacking to further increase the damage they take from his attacks. Because Astral Spirit is his only mana-costing ability, Elder Titan focuses on building durability items and increasing his attack speed, so that he can take the enemy head-on and maximize his damage output.<br/>Built as a utility initiator-disabler, Elder Titan gets only one value point in Astral Spirit, then focuses on maxing out Echo Stomp and Natural Order, while leveling his ultimate where possible. The objective of this build is to combine Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp in order to set up long-duration sleeps on enemies, and then weaken their defenses for teammates to exploit, using his ultimate both as a nuke and a disable. Because he lacks levels in Astral Spirit, Elder Titan will have little auto-attack damage output, and focuses on using his spells to great effect. Elder Titan must build items that grant him mana for sustaining his casting, mobility to let him more easily position himself to cast his spells, and utility items to help give his team an advantage in fights.<br/> Elder Titan is most often played as an off-laner, but can be played as a mid hero or safe-lane support depending on the lineup.
<br/>Astral Spirit allows an off-lane Elder Titan to get last-hits from distance, and he benefits from getting solo experience if the enemy supports fail to zone him out effectively. Additionally, the spirit can accrue bonus damage and movement speed via nearby jungle creeps as well as lane creeps, giving Elder Titan more mobility and last-hitting power as needed, and scout the fog of war for potential incoming ganks. A value point in Echo Stomp can serve as an emergency escape spell of sorts, as it can stop attackers in their tracks once they've expended their disables, allowing Elder Titan to escape while they are asleep.<br/>A mid Elder Titan can use a combination of Astral Spirit and Natural Order to bully his opponent, as he can gain bonus damage and movement speed through the spirit to trade right-clicks and chase the enemy mid down, while Natural Order's aura greatly increases the amount of damage they take from trading attacks. As well, Echo Stomp can be used to punish any enemies attempting to tower dive, or can aid in setting up friendly ganks.<br/>As a support, Elder Titan will have very little farm and experience priority, however he can remotely set up disables via Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp once he hits level 2, which can disable the enemy's off-laner long enough for his team to get in a favorable position for a gank. As well, he can transition into a utility farming support by passing his Astral Spirit through neutral camps in his jungle and then use the bonus damage to farm if needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Echo Stomp</h4>Echo Stomp is an unorthodox disable in that it is a sleep, rather than a stun. As such, it is mechanically very unusual but can be very strong when used properly.<br/>Remember that Echo Stomp is a channeled spell, and as such stunning or silencing Elder Titan during the 1.2 second delay will interrupt it and cause the spell to fail. Because of this, Echo Stomp is best used when combined with Astral Spirit.<br/>The most important aspect of Echo Stomp is that all slept units will awake immediately upon taking player-based damage. As such, it requires that allies do not attempt to attack or cast spells against the enemy, as it will remove the disable and allow the target to act again.<br/>Conversely, however, this can be used to your advantage, as damage from non-player sources will not wake the target up. This means that if an enemy hero is tower-diving or has accrued creep aggro, inflicting them with the sleep will allow towers and creeps to continue to damage them without waking them up. Additionally, this works with Roshan's damage, making Echo Stomp a very strong spell for countering Roshan attempts by the enemy team.<br/>Used properly, Echo Stomp is a very strong initiating spell, as it can sleep multiple enemies for up to 5 seconds, a duration comparable to the longest disables in the game. As well, it can be a very strong counter-initiation spell, breaking up enemy ganks by interrupting them as they are distracted trying to kill an ally.<br/>If you manage to knock out multiple enemy heroes with an Echo Stomp, it is extremely important to prioritize and focus your targets. As the enemy will only awaken once the duration expires or when they take player-based damage, you can single out one enemy to focus down and kill while their teammates are still unconscious, and then clean up the remainder more easily once the sleep's duration ends. Hitting all of the enemies with player-based damage will immediately wake them up, wasting the sleep.<br/>Echo Stomp can be a useful juking spell if being chased through the jungle by the enemy. Elder Titan can run around a blind corner, and then immediately begin channeling Echo Stomp. Any chasing enemies will likely not have enough time to interrupt Elder Titan upon reaching his location, and will be knocked out, allowing him to escape.<br/>If attempting to combine Echo Stomp with Earth Splitter, at least 2 levels in Echo Stomp are required, as Earth Splitter takes 3.14 seconds to implode after casting. Under optimal circumstances, enemies will have only 0.54 seconds to escape the spell, and will be unable to do so once Echo Stomp is level 3 or higher.<h4>Astral Spirit</h4>Astral Spirit is the lynchpin that allows Elder Titan's abilities to work together to create devastating combinations. It allows Elder Titan to cast Echo Stomp from long range, and carries his Natural Order aura as well, making it one of his strongest spells. No matter how Elder Titan is skilled, at least one early level is needed to make his abilities effective.<br/>Astral Spirit spawns at a target location up to a distance of 1200 away from Elder Titan, and can then be controlled to move even further after that. This allows Elder Titan to set up Echo Stomp from very long ranges, without revealing his own position to the enemy team.<br/>Remember that Astral Spirit's movement speed is set to match that of Elder Titan when he cast it. This makes building movement speed items on Elder Titan very important, as it affects not only his own mobility but that of his spirit.<br/>Astral Spirit gives Elder Titan bonus damage and movement speed for a short duration after returning to him. As such, it can be a very strong spell to use against crowded enemies, as it can accrue massive amounts of bonus damage and movement speed, turning Elder Titan into a terrifying threat if he has enough attack speed to take advantage of this bonus damage.<br/>In general, Astral Spirit's priority should be passing through enemy heroes if possible, as it serves three purposes. Passing the spirit through enemy heroes will accrue much more bonus damage and movement speed for Elder Titan than it will for creeps, putting the spirit on top of an enemy hero weakens them by applying Natural Order's aura to them, and it reveals their position through the fog of war, allowing nearby allies to take advantage of this knowledge and the aura.<br/>Astral Spirit will accrue bonus damage and movement speed not only by passing through enemies, but neutrals as well (even spell immune ones). As such, if the opportunity presents itself, try to pass the spirit through jungle camps if possible, as they can serve as an additional source of power. The spirit also deals damage to them as it passes through, weakening them for later jungling.<br/>Remember that Astral Spirit still gathers bonuses for units it passes through on its return path to Elder Titan. Because of this, it can be beneficial to re-position Elder Titan after casting the spell, so that after passing through as many creeps as it can during its duration, it can pass through even more on its return path, maximizing the bonuses gained from the spell.<br/>The above can also be used to cast surprise Echo Stomps, as the spirit moves at 600 speed when returning, faster than Elder Titan himself can move. After casting Astral Spirit, maneuver it through the fog of war and behind the enemy, then return it so that it paths over the enemy on its return path to Elder Titan. When it reaches the enemy's position, begin channeling Echo Stomp, and the spirit will stop and begin casting it on top of the enemy. This can be a very rude surprise for enemy players, who will usually be looking in the wrong direction and not expect the Astral Spirit to be moving so quickly, let alone stop in the middle of a return.<h4>Natural Order</h4>Even though it has no visual effect, Natural Order is one of Elder Titan's strongest abilities, as it can nullify base armor and counteract base magic resistance on enemy heroes, making even the toughest enemies much squishier.<br/>Both Elder Titan and his Astral Spirit carry this aura. However, keep in mind that the aura has a very small radius, so in practical terms it is only useful when Elder Titan himself is engaging a foe or his spirit is on top of them.<br/>Natural Order makes Elder Titan a very strong hero to counter agility-based carries. As most agility carries will build agility items to boost their base damage and attack speed, they will also have unusually high amounts of base armor, which is nullified by Natural Order. As well, agility carries will normally have small health pools, making them weak against magic nukes, which Natural Order also amplifies through its magic resistance reduction.<br/>Depending on how Elder Titan is built, players should make use of the aura on either Elder Titan, his Astral Spirit, or both. As Elder Titan fights enemies, his teammates should focus down any enemies he engages, or any enemies that are standing inside his Astral Spirit. Try to micro-manage the Astral Spirit to put it on top of high-priority targets, in order to weaken their defenses from a distance if Elder Titan himself cannot reach them.<h4>Earth Splitter</h4>Earth Splitter is an extremely strong damage spell that has a long delay but a wide area of effect. Casting it successfully can severely weaken the entire enemy team and slow them down tremendously, allowing teammates to mop up.<br/>In general, Earth Splitter is best used once the enemy team has been knocked out by Echo Stomp, as the sleep's duration allows the ultimate to run its full course. However, it can also be used if the enemy has been disabled by a teammate, such as through Ravage, Black Hole, Chronosphere or Reverse Polarity.<br/>Always remember to place your Astral Spirit and Elder Titan himself in close proximity of the enemy when the crack implodes, in order to apply the Natural Order debuff to them. This will ensure that the enemy will take almost the full brunt of the damage, and places Elder Titan in a favorable position to begin attacking the enemy using bonus damage from Astral Spirit, as they will be severely slowed as well.<br/>Due to its wide area and long range, Earth Splitter can be a strong chasing spell, as it can force enemy players to path differently in order to avoid the damage and slow. As well, in emergencies it can be used as an escape spell by casting it in a direction and then running down the length of the crack, forcing enemies to break off or be damaged and slowed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Huskar is a resilient ranged attacker who sacrifices his own health to inflict greater damage. An injured Huskar attacks with incredible speed, making him frustratingly hard to kill even at the brink of death. His deadly Life Break is supremely suited to killing enemies one-on-one, especially during the early to mid game. Huskar's natural magic resistance prevents enemies from nuking him down while he finishes the job, then heals himself with Inner Vitality. He fulfills the roles of carry and ganker, although the damage over time from Burning Spears will not match heavier carries in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very resilient.<br/>Requires no mana management.<br/>Can turn fights around even at low health.<br/>Excellent early to mid game presence.<br/>Counters heavy magical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Many counters.<br/>No disables.<br/>Low armor.<br/>Needs Regeneration items to Survive.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Huskar is not a true initiator. Try to let another team member initiate, then jump in to single out soft targets.<br/>A good amount of Huskar's damage comes from Burning Spear's magical burn damage, meaning that magic resistance makes Huskar much less effective.<br/>Huskar's abilities synergizes well with each other, Burning Spear and Life Break both use up health, and feed your Berserker's Blood increasing your damage output while Inner Vitality makes you more durable.<br/> Due to his low base , Huskar is susceptible to physical burst damage. 
<br/>Good examples of this is Clinkz and Sven as well as any carry who has a Daedalus or Desolator completed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Inner Vitality</h4>Use Inner Vitality on yourself or your allies before jumping into a fight to increase their durability.<br/>Do not worry about casting it too early before a team fight as it has a fairly long duration and its cooldown at max level is a few seconds shorter than its duration. This will reduce the chances that you are caught off-guard and become disabled long enough before being able to cast it. This will also increase the chance that you can re-cast it during a fight in case that you are Purged or another team mate is in dire need of regeneration.<br/>Always use Inner Vitality before using your ultimate to increase your chance of surviving and reduce the toll on your HP done by your ultimate.<br/>With enough mana regeneration, you can even use Inner Vitality constantly, mitigating the need to return to base. This makes heroes such as Crystal Maiden and Keeper of the Light a good ally of Huskar.<h4>Burning Spear</h4>Burning Spears is useful for harrassing enemies during the laning phase.<br/>Keep in mind the cast range of Burning Spear is 450, but Huskar's attack range is only 400. Therefore you can increase your range by 50 when manually casting Burning Spear. However, putting Burning Spear on autocast will not increase your range.<br/>Remember that Burning Spears will stack on an enemy. You can manual cast them repeatedly on laning phase to harass enemies without drawing creep aggro. When you can regenerate health enough to sustain Burning Spear, switch it to auto-attack and burn them down!<h4>Berserker's Blood</h4>Berserker's Blood makes Huskar very potent against heavy magic damage teams.<br/>With enough stacks and health left, Berserker's Blood can help you survive finishing spells that deal magical damage such as Thundergod's Wrath, Assassinate and Reaper's Scythe.<br/>Berserker's Blood does not protect against pure damage. Dealing with heroes such as Bane and Timbersaw can result in death, as using your ultimate in their presence can have dire consequences, since some of their spells are not reduced by magic resistance.<br/> It is important to remember that the magic resistance from Berserker's Blood  equate to spell immunity, a common mistake for new players is to treat it as such. Huskar is still vulnerable to huge burst of magical damage when at nearly full health. Examples of this would be  at point blank range (most likely after using Life Break) with the maximum amount of souls and stacks of  both of which could kill Huskar even at full health. 
<br/>Berserker's Blood works best against gradual magical damage or damage spread over multiple instances like Rot, Life Drain, Mystic Flare, Static Storm, Epicenter, Echo Slam, and Poison Nova, all of which are almost impossible to be used to insta-kill Huskar since their damage will be greatly reduced. But keep in mind that some of these also provide debuffs like stun, slow and silence that could hinder Huskar.<br/>The attack speed from Berserker's Blood is unreliable as it depends on your current health. If you are your team's main carry, consider building attack speed items like Mjollnir and Assault Cuirass to further boost your DPS.<h4>Life Break</h4>In most cases, if an enemy hero used their escape skill while Huskar is airborne, Huskar will still be able to finish his jump.<br/>Be wary of heroes that have high natural magic resistance like Anti-Mage due to his Spell Shield because using Life Break against them might deal more damage to you than to them. Same can be said against heroes that usually build Hood of Defiance or Pipe of Insight.<br/>You should also be warned not to use your ultimate on a hero who has spell immunity or else you lose a percentage of your health while the target does not. However, the slow will still pierce through spell immunity.<br/> As Life Break deals magical damage to an enemy relative to his current health, it is possible to kill any enemy in one hit with the help of damage amplification, provided it is not spell immune or has access to very high magic resistance (e.g. ).
<br/>It is possible to use certain combinations of items and heroes together with Huskar to kill any hero instantly. For example applying the effects of Veil of Discord, Ethereal Blade and Orchid Malevolence to a target and then hitting them with an Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Life Break will cause an instant death. However, building all these utility items on Huskar himself will destroy a great deal of his carry potential. This same effect can be achieved using Soul Catcher instead of Veil of Discord or Decrepify instead of Ethereal Blade.<br/>Beware of heroes with Blade Mail as they can destroy you if you use Life Break on them recklessly.<br/>Also it is worth noting that any hero using Blade Mail with sufficiently high health will kill you if you use Life Break on them assuming that you do not have spell immunity.<br/>  enables Huskar to destroy enemy heroes with high health very quickly. The reduced cooldown will allow Huskar deal magical damage equal to 73.74% of the enemy's health in 4 seconds if he is able to use Life Break twice in succession. 
<br/>Life Break can also be used on multiple different enemies in a team fight making it easier for the rest of your team to finish them off.<br/>The low cooldown from Aghanim's Scepter can also be used to jump from one hero to another. If you are being focused on by a melee carry who happen to have spell immunity, jump to another hero to kill them off, or stall enough time so that the enemy's spell immunity runs out.<br/>Jumping to a different enemy is also useful for timing out debuffs on Huskar. Jumping to another enemy while you are slowed, rooted or disarmed will give you a chance to turn the tables against your enemy.<br/>Aghanim's Scepter's upgrade will also apply a 60% slow that pierces through spell immunity.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Io is a unique hero that provides boosts to its allies by linking to them. While relatively powerless alone, Io can be extremely useful when paired with the appropriate heroes. It regenerates allies through Tether, and buffs their defense and attack speed with Overcharge. But most importantly, Io can Relocate an ally to any point on the map, setting up perfect ganks or saving that ally from certain death.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not item dependent.<br/>Global mobility.<br/>Grealty increases one's durability.<br/>Low mana costs.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dies very easily.<br/>Requires precise coordination with teammates.<br/>Useless alone.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Io is best played with a partner with whom you share communication.<br/>Io is extremely weak and can't do much alone. His utility comes entirely from boosting teammates.<br/>Io is expected to sacrifice its life to save another teammate.<br/>As a general rule, Io works best with a Carry who has mobility and health and/or mana regen issues; see the Counter page for some suggested Io Buddies.<br/>Tether heals his allies for 1.5x the healing done to Io itself. Don't forget this to save allies and in lane phase, when using items like Tango, Enchanted Mango and building items like Urn of Shadows and others.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Tether</h4>Tether is required to buff any ally with Overcharge or to use Relocate.<br/>Tether can be used on allied heroes to get to their side with great speed, as it latches from a considerable distance.<br/>Approaching a confrontation from behind will allow for easier use of Tether's slow. Positional items are also useful for this.<br/>Use Tether on an ally or lane creep to escape dangerous situations.<br/>When ganking, remember to slow the target target by passing over them with Tether's link.<br/> Tether to an ally, then use a healing item to double the benefit for that ally. 
<br/>The Tethered ally will not gain anything if Io is at full health. Using Overcharge to lower your health before using any healing items will assure you are able to pass along the boosted regeneration.<br/>However, for mana, it does not matter if Io is full or not. Mana will always be transfered, regardless of Io's mana status.<br/>When ganking or escaping, always remember that Tether duration is the same as its cooldown, so it can be maintained on constantly as long as you have enough mana.<h4>Spirits</h4>During the early game, Spirits can be used to harass and keep enemies away from the creep wave.<br/>Spirits take practice and focus to control, but should not come before performing Io's other duties.<br/> Spirits will hit  enemies, and can be used to finish off fleeing targets.
<br/>It can also be used to detect invisible enemies nearby, although there is no guarantee Spirit will impact an unseen foe.<h4>Overcharge</h4> Overcharge is extremely powerful on carries and should be used during teamfights and ganks.
<br/>Enemies may target Io because of this. Combined with its health costs, using Overcharge can leave Io very vulnerable.<br/>The damage reduction of this skill is also notable and can considerably increase the survivability of your partner.<br/>Overcharge should always be skilled early as Io is not able to heal his allies with tether with full health. Overcharge grants an easy means to lower your HP and mana.<h4>Relocate</h4>Use Relocate to bring an ally into a ganking position.<br/>Use Relocate to save an ally from certain death. This is arguably the most important thing Io can do for the team.
<br/>Doing so will usually result in Io's death when Relocate returns it to the original location.<br/>Remember to break the Tether before this happens, or the ally will be brought back with Io.<br/>It's also possible to Relocate from a safe spot, then bring back an injured ally upon returning. This is not always viable however, as it entails the 12 second discrepancy between Relocations.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Kunkka is a strategic fighter that relies on his carefully placed abilities to disrupt enemy formations. His skills complement one another, and need to be used in conjunction to be effective. With his Tidebringer, Kunkka can deal a good amount of damage to a large area in front of him. Playing Kunkka requires good timing, tactical thinking, and an understanding of enemy movement. If insufficiently farmed, however, Kunkka will barely do any damage, and must rely on landing his abilities if he is to remain useful to his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Large, disruptive AoE abilities with massive damage.<br/>Wide reach and crowd physical damage with Tidebringer.<br/>X Marks the Spot is a unique single target control ability.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>A hated target in teamfights and may be focused at first.<br/>Requires good timing to land ability combos.<br/>Ability damage falls off in the late game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Kunkka's abilities work best when the enemy team is clumped together. Time your ability usage accordingly.<br/> In general, carry Kunkka can be placed either mid or in the safe lane. 
<br/>As a mid, Kunkka should focus on getting early levels and harassing down the enemy's mid with Tidebringer, then using his spells to get early kills and farm his core items.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Torrent</h4>Torrent allows Kunkka to target an area where, after a delay, any enemies in the area will be stunned, and then damaged and slowed.<br/>Due to its delay, Torrent can be very hard to land and is very mana-costly on a hero with a small mana pool. Good prediction or a leading stun is required to land it properly.<br/>Torrent has a very long range for an area stun, and can be used to predict and pick off fleeing enemies.<br/>Kunkka makes a very visible hand gesture when casting Torrent, which opponents can easily see and use to gauge the timing in which Torrent was cast so that they can dodge it. When casting Torrent on an enemy without a leading disable, try to either cancel your animation in order to fool the enemy if they can see you, or cast it from the fog of war by taking advantage of its extremely long cast range.<br/>Unlike most other spells in the game, Torrent does not require Kunkka to face in the direction that he casts the spell, preventing enemies from easily predicting the location in which the waterspout will appear. This also allows Kunkka to get the spell off a bit faster, as he will not have to turn to face the target area first. Try to be tricky with where you cast Torrent if Kunkka is visible to the enemy, and remember not to target it outside the spell's cast range, otherwise Kunkka will have to turn and walk within range to cast, allowing the enemy to easily see what direction Torrent is being cast in.<br/>Torrent can be more easily landed if X Marks the Spot is used first. By inflicting X on the enemy, and then casting Torrent on that spot, you can force the enemy to return right before Torrent completes. However, mind the cast range of X Marks the Spot, as it is very low at early levels, and be sure that your timing is perfect otherwise the enemy may arrive after the torrent or have time to evade it after returning.<br/>Combined with Tidebringer, Torrent can be used to lock down a foe long enough for you to maneuver into a position favourable to hit them or their teammates with cleave damage.<br/>Torrent can also be used to stack a neutral camp, if timed properly. This is because the units, while thrown into the air, are technically not within the camp's spawn radius, and so new creeps will spawn. This should be utilized either to grant Kunkka's teammates a higher gold per minute, or to increase his own. Torrent should be cast at approximately the XX:57.5 second mark.<h4>Tidebringer</h4>Tidebringer is a castable attack modifier that allows Kunkka to deal cleave damage in a wide area in front of him, giving him a damage bonus with each strike.<br/>Because Tidebringer can only proc once every few seconds, it is recommended to build raw damage over attack speed. Getting a good Tidebringer cleave off can potentially kill enemy heroes in a single attack if Kunkka has enough damage.<br/>Using Tidebringer frequently in-lane is a good way to harass a lane opponent safely from range, but it will also push the creep wave and can reduce Kunkka's ability to farm safely. Conversely though, it is also a good lane pusher when playing mid, as it can force the enemy mid to retreat to their tower when the runes spawn, allowing Kunkka and his team to more easily control the rune spots.<br/>Remember that Tidebringer does not work against wards and buildings, and that leaving it on auto-cast can cause it to proc before it is needed. Try to manually cast Tidebringer whenever possible, so as not to waste its attack power and so that it is readily available should a cleave opportunity arise.<br/>When set on auto-cast, Kunkka retains the damage bonus when attacking allied units, even though the spell does not proc. This can give Kunkka an advantage in denying creeps, however be sure to turn off auto-cast so that you do not accidentally proc the spell when attacking an enemy creep afterward.<br/>Cleave ignores armor on the splashed targets, and the cleave damage is based on Kunkka's attack damage rather than any damage dealt to the unit that was attacked. Therefore, when using Tidebringer, it is best to attack a nearby creep to inflict cleave on all enemies behind it.<br/>Remember that Tidebringer's cleave has a very long range. Angled properly, it is possible to hit enemies through the fog of war, and even through invisibility, making it a powerful ability for killing fleeing enemy heroes that are low on health. It is best to use a nearby enemy creep, or even one from a neutral camp, in order to splash the damage in the direction of your choosing.<h4>X Marks the Spot</h4>X Marks the Spot is a flexible spell that can be cast on enemies and allies alike to return them to their point of origin after a delay.<br/>X Marks the Spot counters enemy heroes with great mobility since the ability forcibly drag them back after enemy moves away and his or her abilities are on cooldown.<br/>Used on enemies, X can be used to prevent escapes and lock down foes for your spells and those of your allies. Used on allies, it gives them a safe method of return if they are disabled while initiating. However, remember that Return still requires Kunkka to execute his cast animation, so the target will return to the X 0.4 seconds after Kunkka is commanded to.<br/>When being chased, X Marks the Spot can be used to return the chasing enemy to an early and more distant location.<br/>X's principal utility is in locking down a target so that they can be hit by Torrent and Ghostship, both of which are otherwise hard to land. The same applies to teammates with similarly hard to land spells such as Light Strike Array, Split Earth, and so on. Good timing is required to do so, however, as returning the target before the spell hits gives them time to evade, while returning them after will result in a clean miss.<br/>X Marks the Spot has a very short cast range at level 1, making it hard to land on an enemy during a gank. However, it lasts for the full 4 seconds at all levels so managing to cast the spell will give your team a large amount of time to set up for the return.<br/>There is no maximum limit on X's return range, so it can bring its target back to the origin even after teleporting across the map. As such, it can be used on a foe who is attempting to teleport back to their base, or on an ally to get back to base to grab items from the stash or refill a Bottle and then return. Kunkka has to cast X on himself before he starts teleporting to make use of this trick.<br/>X Marks the Spot lasts twice as long on allies. This gives it very powerful utility since an ally can have up to 8 seconds to scout, initiate, tower dive, or otherwise harass the enemy and be pulled back to safety.<br/>Beware, X Marks the Spot cannot pull back invulnerable allied units. This means that certain abilities are able to interrupt an allied X, so be sure that you know what the enemy's capabilities are, as you can return a teammate early before they are inflicted with invulnerability, or hold back the return until after.<br/>Conversely though, allies who are spell immune will still be pulled back. Therefore, if trouble is encountered, they can apply spell immunity to themselves in order to prevent themselves from being disabled, and still have a way with which they can return.<br/>One useful way to gauge the timing of X Marks the Spot is to use the triplets from the spell's sound effect. Each ascending triplet marks one second of the spell's duration, so knowing the timing of any disables waiting at the return spot can allow Kunkka to pull enemies back in a timely manner. Again, remember that the target is returned on a 0.4 second delay due to Kunkka's cast animation, so be mindful of that as well.<h4>Ghostship</h4>Ghostship is a wide-area magic nuke that deals significant damage in its impact area and buffs allies that it passes through on the way.<br/>Like Torrent, Ghostship can benefit from being set up with X Marks the Spot in order to lock down a foe prior to casting. Because X Marks the Spot's maximum cast range at level 4 exactly matches the impact distance of Ghostship, the two spells work extremely well together. Also remember to walk back and cast the spell if the target is marked at a closer distance.<br/>Ghostship's cooldown is pretty short compared to other ultimate ability. After Kunkka kills a hero with all him abilities, his ultimate will be ready in less than a minute.<br/>While its cooldown is quite short, Ghostship is very mana-costly, especially on a hero with a small mana pool like Kunkka. Additionally, its long delay means that landing the spell requires a large amount of crowd control or the element of surprise.<br/>Ghostship will always appear a specific distance behind Kunkka and end a specific distance in front of Kunkka, taking a specific amount of time to do so. The distance at which the boat appears and hits can be seen by hovering over the ability and noting the radius circle. You can also just cast it from outside Kunkka's range as to make him move into range and ensure that the Ghostship will land to where you targeted it.<br/> Although it is not obvious, the Rum buff is a very powerful ability that should never be discounted. Any allies with the Rum buff will take half damage from all enemy damage sources for its duration, and can never be killed by the remainder once the buff wears off. This allows allies to absorb up to twice the normal amount of damage and still survive, making it extremely powerful on tanky heroes that are already very damage-resistant.
<br/>The Rum buff lasts only 10 seconds. If your team can't finish the fight in 10 seconds and the enemy teams has DoT abilities such as Doom or Poison Nova, consider retreating after or even before the Rum buff dissipates.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Legion Commander is ganking carry whose damage potential is theoretically unlimited. She is able to heal, buff herself and her allies with Press the Attack, and finish off enemies with Overwhelming Odds. With each victorious Duel, the Legion Commander becomes even more unstoppable. However, if she fails to win regular Duels, her damage may suffer as a result, rendering her much less useful as the game goes on.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Excellent snowballing potential.<br/>Tanky during laning phase.<br/>Prevent enemy from escaping.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on winning Duels.<br/>High mana cost during laning phase.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Even though Legion Commander is technically a carry, she needs to also gank early to increase her bonus damage from Duel. 
<br/>Be sure to take advantage of any ganking opportunities, instead of farming endlessly away from your team.<br/>Legion Commander works best in coordinated teams that can effectively soften and disable a target for her to kill with Duel, and thus snowball as a carry.<br/>During early to mid-game, try targeting the softer casters or supports, like Crystal Maiden and Shadow Shaman. This way, if you were to lose a Duel and they gain the bonus attack damage, it won't affect your team in the late-game as these heroes rely more on their spells than their attacks.<br/>Duel allows her to build a large amount of attack damage, meaning that to amplify her damage, it's most cost-effective to build items that reduce the enemy's armor or increases her attack speed, rather than buying items which add more damage.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Overwhelming Odds</h4>This is your ranged damage spell. It can be used to harass enemies in lane and get last hits at the same time.<br/>It's most effective against multiple enemy heroes, It's best to save this spell to cast when you can hit all the enemy heroes in your lane.<br/>Using this in the jungle is often a waste of mana due to most camps only having 2-3 creeps, and stacks often having multiple magical resistance auras.<br/>It can be used to stack a camp at a distance in order to return to lane faster, or to stack two camps at once.<h4>Press the Attack</h4>Use Press the Attack before joining a fight or initiating a Duel to give Legion Commander bonus attack speed.<br/>Remember that this spell heals and dispels debuffs. Use it on allies if they are low on health, or need a stun or other debuff dispelled.<br/>If your carry has more damage per attack than you, use it on them during a push.<br/>Press the attack has a very long cast backswing (0.93 seconds), and should be cancelled whenever possible to take advantage of the attack speed as soon as possible.<h4>Moment of Courage</h4>The lifesteal and extra damage allows Legion Commander to jungle as early as level one.<br/>The benefit of leveling this skill is minimal in the early game. A second point is enough to jungle sustainably, after that it's usually better to max her other skills first.<br/>Take advantage of enemy creeps by dueling near the creep wave. They will attack you and thus proc Moment of Courage more often.<br/>The instant attacks from this passive act like a situationally active attack speed boost which can put her effective attack speed above the normal 600 attack speed limit.<h4>Duel</h4>Even if an ally deals the killing blow during a duel, the attack damage is still applied to the surviving Duellist.<br/>In the early game, Duel easier targets like supports to make sure Legion Commander gets the bonus damage.<br/>When Dueling enemies with more HP, make sure Legion Commander has the damage and/or assistance to. Otherwise, you will feed bonus damage to the enemy carry.<br/>Generally, DO NOT Duel enemy carries unless they're very low on health already.<br/>Due to the double edged nature of Duel, attempting to use it liberally on targets in teamfights can sometimes give bad results for you and your team.<br/>Initiating with it is not always the best choice as duels should ideally not last long in order to avoid being stunned and denied of your success.<br/>Duel Silences and Mutes both participants, so you should use PTA, blademail, and other active items before<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lifestealer is a voracious flesh-eater who Feasts on his prey to regain his health, after inflicting them with deadly Open Wounds.

To do this, you keep attacking Roshan until you reach low health, then go to the nearby Radiant Jungle, and use your abilities to heal, then go back to Roshan and repeat the process. If you plan on doing this, be careful of enemy wards anywhere nearby, as if you get ganked by the enemy team you have a low chance of surviving.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Rage</h4>Rage increases his attack speed, thus chance based items like Mjollnir or Skull Basher become safer choices, as higher attack speed it allows the items to proc more often and reliably.<br/>Rage has an instant cast time, maybe try to dodge an incoming Storm Hammer or Magic Missile, wasting your opponent's mana and indirectly protecting your allies.<h4>Feast</h4> Feast deals bonus damage based on your target's current HP. The lower he is, the less Feast will help you.
<br/>This gives a weird synergy between Lifestealer and Viper, as the Netherdrake deals bonus damage to low HP heroes with Nethertoxin. So in an ideal scenario, you could hit a full-HP hero first a couple of times, then let Viper finish him off while you switch target... But things usually don't go this smoothly...<h4>Open Wounds</h4>Open Wounds Heal for a percentage of the damage they deal to that unit. Using Iron Talon on a Creep will also heal you.<br/>Since Open Wounds' cast range is so bad at level 1 (a measly 200, barley more than your auto attack), it scales proportionately pretty well!... But neither the slow or the heal or the duration improves.<h4>Infest</h4>Infest can control Ancient Creeps at level 2.<br/>Controlling a creep while Infested won't break the creep's cover.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lycan is a remarkable pusher and split-pusher that can wear down the enemies and force them to react quickly to his regular tower onslaughts; as towers melt incredibly fast under his and his minions' pressure, boosted by their canine Feral Impulse. His only contribution to full-on team fights will be the bonus damage he grants with Howl to his allies, his allies' summons, his owns summons and himself... And his formidable right-click power. Else he can surge out of the woods for a quick gank or push after he transformed with Shapeshift, moving at a speed of 650. Finally, good players will make the best usage of his Summon Wolves ability and scout the enemies' position while remaining undetected since they're invisible when maxed out.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great jungler.<br/>Can take out Roshan by himself.<br/>Terrific pusher.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can require some help in the laning stage.<br/>Reliant on BKB for protection.<br/>No reliable disables.<br/>Little team fight contribution.<br/>Needs correct micro-management and decision-making to get the most out of him.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because your Howl immobilize Lycan use it just before Shapeshift.<br/>When taking on Roshan, it is advised to use a Smoke of Deceit to avoid being spotted by enemy observer wards. Teams facing a Lycan will do their best to prevent early Roshan kills by planting observer wards near the pit; given that a detected Lycan is easy prey while doing battle with Roshan, slipping past those wards will do wonders for his lifespan.<br/>At level 7, with items like Vladmir's Offering and Power Treads or Medallion of Courage, Lycan can solo Roshan. Summon your Wolves and tank them alternately with the hero, but do not let them die until the re-summon is ready. Keep Shapeshift just in case the enemy comes for you, so you can escape.<br/>Any item that provides armor reduction (Desolator, Medallion, Assault Cuirass) or an aura benefits both the wolves and the Necronomicon units. Keep in mind that the melee Necronomicon Warrior has the lowest Base Attack Time of the game of 0.75 seconds, which makes him scale really well with Howl's flat damage bonus. Adding reduced armor to the mix will considerably increase your total DPS.<br/>You can buy a Scythe of Vyse to disable and slow your enemy from distance to hunt him.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Summon Wolves</h4>Wolves can be used to scout runes at the beginning of the match and during the laning phase to avoid losing gold and experience.<br/>Always Summon Wolves in the base when going out to jungle for the first time (at about the 0-10 second mark) since the wolves are fast enough that you can get a creep camp killed without using any mana.<br/>Wolves' invisibility at level 3, very low base attack time and quick movement make them great deniers. Use them to destroy runes, aegis and allied towers with all impunity if the situation is too risky, or too far away for you to go there in person. The most talented players will even manage to entirely body-block a hero in a narrow path with both wolves, and possibly deny yourself if certain debuffs are placed on Lycan.<br/>Wolves can also be used to scout and keep tabs on particular heroes without them knowing. Select your wolf and hit M (default) and then click an enemy hero; the wolf will follow the hero but will not attack, so it will remain invisible. Do this with each wolf and you can get constant vision of two enemy heroes. This is great for setting up ganks or for evaluating whether to take a team fight in a particular area. Keep in mind that if your wolves lose vision of who they are following for too long, they stop following.<br/> You can also use the wolves' invisibility to sneak past the enemy lines and teleport to them using , hitting one tier 3 while allied creeps disabled  on another.
<br/>With a Necronomicon 3 and another big item such as Assault Cuirass, you probably have enough DPS to even go through backdoor protection, as a last resort while the enemy is somehow distracted.<br/>Use your wolves to stack two ancient camps at once. Then you can summon your necronomicon to take them down quickly.<h4>Howl</h4>Always keep an eye on the minimap. Save Howl to give teammates a decent damage boost, aiding them in fighting and securing kills.<br/>If the enemy somehow denies plenty of their creeps, the +14 damage from a level 1 one Howl will go a long way to help you securing them.<h4>Feral Impulse</h4>As the description says, the aura is applied to every unit under Lycan's control. This includes his wolves obviously, his Necronomicon units and any unit he might have under control through purchase of one or more Helm of the Dominator(s)<br/>You can control even more units with Ability Draft shenanigans.<h4>Shapeshift</h4>Shapeshift is a very strong and versatile Ultimate to use. When activated, it gives Lycan hasted movement speed, allowing a great deal of maneuverability in battle to chase down fleeing heroes or to escape from potentially dangerous areas. While Shapeshifted, you are immune to every kind of Slow, including hexes, purges and powerful slowing ultimates like Epicenter, Freezing Field.<br/>Up to a certain extent, once you start relying on your fast movement speed, you are more vulnerable to root effects like Pit of Malice or Frostbite, especially since Lycan seldom builds a Manta Style.<br/>Shapeshift is an aura and the 650 movement speed is shared with units under his control allowing the wolves and Necronomicon units to chase as well. Unlike Feral Impulse, the aura is global; if you're desperate to get a bit of damage on a building (to finish it off?) you can always use Shapeshift and only send your summons in.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Magnus is one of the few melee heroes who can solo the middle lane well, because of his skill set. Shockwave allows him to safely get last hits while also harassing the lane opponent. His ultimate, Reverse Polarity, is an extremely important ability for teamfights, allowing him to stun and group up enemies hit into a small area in front of him, which can then be moved through Skewer. It is ideal for him especially if he is needed to be a carry in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great teamfighter thanks to Reverse Polarity and Skewer.<br/>Can be played as right-clicker.<br/>Compliments the team's late-game carry.<br/>Good hero to pick off with.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Only useful in the late-game because of Reverse Polarity.<br/>Has mana problems because of high-mana cost spells and spamming Shockwave.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Most of Magnus' abilities work effectively only if his targets are in front of him. When surrounded, Magnus will be forced to change directions too much, not only delaying him from casting spells in rapid succession, but also rendering his spells' area-of-effects useless. As such, place Magnus in the side lines, or until his enemies are in a manageable range in front of him. You should only place yourself in the middle when planning to cast your ultimate, Reverse Polarity, since it forces all of the targets you hit to be in front of you.<br/>Magnus players need to communicate with the team because his initiations are most likely to be sudden.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shockwave</h4>Shockwave is Magnus's ranged nuke, one with a low mana cost:<br/>Shockwave is Magnus's signature laning ability, since it's perfect for both harassing heroes and last-hitting creeps. Thanks to the mana cost and low cooldown, Magnus is able to perform this ability continuously, so long as he receives a stable mana supply.<br/>Though usually used against disabled enemies, Shockwave can act as a great finisher to fleeing enemies. Make sure to cast it carefully, since it has a limited range.<br/>Take note of Shockwave's limited area-of-effect. Much like Lion's Earth Spike, Shockwave directly affects targets in a straight path. Aim to hit multiple targets to maximize its effectiveness.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Empower</h4>Empower is a great buff that boosts base damage for a long duration, as well as grant cleave with each attack on melee heroes. Use it as much as you can on allies or yourself whenever possible, especially when a team fight is ensuing. Outside of team fights, Empower could be used for farming in lanes or jungles.<br/>Don't be afraid to cast Empower on ranged allies, especially if they are carries; ranged heroes like Drow Ranger or Weaver can greatly benefit from the base damage boost, since it adds more power to their already devastating basic attacks.<br/>In comparison, a Battle Fury has a cleave radius of 280, and does 35% damage. Empower has a smaller radius of 200, but deals 50% damage at its highest level. This ability can, in some cases, act as a free Battle Fury.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Skewer</h4>Skewer| is soft-nuke and reposition skill that Magnus to rush forth towards a certain place and forcefully drag, and damage, all enemy units in his path. It is a tricky ability to use effectively:<br/>When the target is moving, determine its path ahead of time, since there is a short delay in deploying. The closer you are to the target, the sooner Skewer will land.<br/>To maximize its range, always target Skewer's landing point from a distance.<br/>Note that Skewer is not a disable; it does not interrupt targets from casting their spells. Skewer is more of a crippling ability used to push targets to a certain distance and slow them, making escape more difficult.<br/>Always try to Skewer in front of an enemy; the farther the target is pushed away from safety, the better.<br/>Though it is offensive in nature, Skewer can also act as a quick escape mechanism, functioning similarly to a slower Force Staff. You can charge toward cliffs to make it more difficult for your pursuers to chase you.<br/>During the laning phase, try to Skewer enemy heroes toward your tower; they will be forced to take tower damage, giving you additional offense while fighting them.<br/>Skewer placement is usually ideal when in front of a hero. This can easily be attained with a Blink Dagger, as it lets you blink in front of your enemy for an easier placement. Invisibility can also be used to your advantage, as you can easily place yourself in front of the target without their knowledge (unless of course they have methods to prevent invisibility).<br/>Skewer is a good initiation ability in the absence of a Blink Dagger. Use it to position yourself into the middle of an enemy team for Reverse Polarity. Keep in mind that you are not immune to crowd control during Skewer, so wait for the proper time before attempting to use Skewer in this fashion.<br/>Skewer has a long cooldown of 30 seconds, so make sure to use it only when you really need it; otherwise, you will lose either an escape ability, or an offensive cripple.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Reverse Polarity</h4>Reverse Polarity is one of the most powerful team fight disables in the game:<br/> When planning to cast, place yourself in the middle of as many heroes as you can. The more heroes you disable, the more advantage you gain in the team fight.
<br/>But don't be too greedy to use your ultimate, Reverse Polarity on many heroes. Even though it's much better to use Magnus' ultimate on many heroes, it's still good to use Reverse Polarity on the core heroes of the enemy team.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Night Stalker is a strong early game ganker during the night. Night Stalker depends greatly on darkness in order to be effective as his abilities greatly increase in strength during the night. If left unchecked, Night Stalker can snowball by getting kills after kills in the early game and controlling the map in the mid-later stages of the game with superior night vision. Night Stalker is not a strong team fighter and should be using superior vision and map control to dictate when and where team fights should occur.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Superior night vision allows Night Stalker to control the map and scout effectively to jump on an unsuspecting lone hero or retreat safely from a scouted gank.<br/>Bulky<br/>High night presence, allowing to shut down individual targets with a semispammable slow, miss chance and silence debuff and chase them down with superior move speed.<br/>Great for hit and run gank tactics<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Weak in team fights due to the lack of strong area of effect spells and ultimate<br/>Weak during day time, forced to play around night time.<br/>Small mana pool.<br/>Poor lane phase.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Unlike other heroes in the game, Night Stalker has below-maximum sight range in the daytime, with only 1200 compared to most other heroes' 1800. However, he more than compensates for this by possessing 1800 night vision, a value only equaled by a few other heroes in the game and more than double the rest. This means that while Night Stalker is relatively easy to sneak up on and gank in daylight, he possesses powerful situational awareness at night, which can allow him to use his abilities to the utmost.<br/> Because of his reliance on levels to be effective in the early game, as well as need for items to take advantage of his passive, Night Stalker is best played as a core hero.
<br/>In many situations, Night Stalker can be a very strong solo mid-laner. His excellent base damage and high base armor allow him to get last-hits and denies fairly reliably, and he benefits greatly from solo experience as he can take advantage of the levels once the first night hits. As well, being mid gives him the option of ganking either top or bottom without the need for a Town Portal Scroll, as he can reach either lane easily and quickly due to Hunter in the Night.<br/>As he can be very strong with just early levels, Night Stalker can be a relatively strong off-laner. His high base strength and armor, along with respectable base damage allow him to survive relatively easily in the off-lane, and use his early levels to punish the enemy's safe-lane once the first night comes.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Void</h4>Void is a damage nuke that mini-stuns its target upon cast and greatly reduces their movement speed, preventing them from running away easily.<br/>Void is the best ability to max early, as it will deal nuke damage to the target, mini-stun them, and then slow them down to allow Balanar to easy get within attack range with Hunter in the Night. Its low cooldown also means that the spell can be used twice or more in a gank or teamfight.<br/>When laning, it is best to avoid leveling Void beyond level 1 even if you have skill points to spend. The ability deals 90 damage at level 1, enough to get last-hits at range, and leveling it up will increase its mana cost. Therefore, it is wise to save the skill point until the additional damage is needed in order to deal damage to enemy heroes.<br/>Remember that Void will mini-stun its target, so Night Stalker can use it to cancel channeled abilities, particularly Town Portal Scroll. Against smart opponents though, it can be wise to wait to cast it until the enemy attempts to use their Town Portal Scroll, as using it to initiate a gank can give them a window to begin channeling an escape, since Night Stalker does not possess any other interrupting disables.<br/>Void's low cooldown makes it a strong spell for breaking Linken's Sphere on an enemy. This can pave the way for allies to cast additional disables on the target, or for Crippling Fear from Night Stalker himself.<h4>Crippling Fear</h4>Crippling Fear allows Night Stalker to inflict an enemy with a powerful silence and miss chance, which increases greatly in potency at night.<br/>Crippling Fear has relatively poor scaling, as it gives Balanar a 5 second silence with one point but only increases slightly in duration with subsequent levels. It is wise to only spend one skill point in the ability early on, but leave it at level 1 until both Void and Hunter in the Night are maxed out.<br/>In fights with multiple enemies, it is important to cast Crippling Fear on the right target in order to prevent the enemy from retaliating. Try to target Crippling Fear on an important enemy caster in order to remove them from the fight for at least 5 seconds, as it can prevent them from hindering your team during a fight.<br/>Depending on the situation, Crippling Fear can be a powerful spell to cast on the enemy's carry. While most carries will build Black King Bar in order to ignore disables, catching an enemy without a BKB with this spell will not only silence them, but will prevent them from easily retaliating with their attacks.<br/>While it is very weak in the daytime, Crippling Fear can still buy a small window of opportunity if cast on the right target. Even though Night Stalker is relatively weak during daytime, he can still disable the enemy with his spells if forced to.<h4>Hunter in the Night</h4>Hunter in the Night empowers Night Stalker's attack speed and movement speed superbly during the night, making him a very powerful ganker during the earliest parts of the game.<br/>Because it can greatly boost Night Stalker's hunting prowess, Hunter in the Night is best maxed out second among his abilities. The greatly enhanced movement and attack speed is crucial for allowing Night Stalker to chase down and tear apart enemies with his attacks.<br/>With +50 movement speed from most boots, level 4 Hunter in the Night will give Night Stalker a movement speed of 465. A 16% movement speed bonus added on top of that, whether from Phase Boots' active ability or Sange and Yasha, will boost his movement speed to 520, nearly Haste speed. Use this to your advantage to chase enemies down or escape with near impunity.<h4>Darkness</h4>Darkness will reduce the enemy's vision range for its duration, affecting heroes as well as buildings and wards.<br/>As Darkness costs no mana to activate, Night Stalker is free to use it whenever the situation requires it.<br/>Remember that Darkness will reduce all enemy vision to a maximum of 675. This means that heroes with abnormally high night vision such as Luna and Slark will have their vision reduced by almost two-thirds, giving Balanar's team a significant advantage against them.<br/>Because time continues to pass for the duration of the ultimate, Darkness can be most profitably cast whenever it is off cooldown during the daytime. By doing so, you effectively reduce the amount of daytime there is in the game, as daytime will continue to tick down during the darkness. At level 16, the enemy team will only have 90 seconds of daylight out of the 8 minute cycle, effectively reducing daylight to 18.75% of the time.<br/>At night, reserve Darkness for until Night Stalker's team is preparing for a gank. While the enemy will suspect something once the ultimate goes up, reducing their vision range will also affect any Observer Wards that they have placed, meaning that they will be only barely more than 40% effective. This can allow Night Stalker and his team to move under the cover of darkness and bypass Observer Wards that do not explicitly cover travel paths.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Omniknight is a defensive support who specializes in healing his allies with Purification and shielding them from damage with Repel and Guardian Angel. Unlike most other supports, he remains relevant in the late game as his abilities lack the type of scaling that makes them irrelevant against farmed enemies. Omniknight is generally played as a safe-lane support, but he can occasionally be played as an off-laner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely powerful defensive abilities.<br/>Relatively tanky support.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Constant mana problems.<br/>Very vulnerable to silence.<br/>Abilities can be purged.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Omniknight should be built for survivability and focus on what is best to counter the enemy lineup. If they have lots of AoE dmg or silences, Guardian Greaves is best and most common on support Omniknights, since it can keep your team up longer and purge most debuffs.<br/>Due to his longer than normal cast animations, playing Omniknight well requires good positioning and planning ahead, as any hesitation can prevent him from getting his spells off in time.<br/>Omniknight is actually quite squishy without his own buffs applied to himself, which is why he needs to be in the back of the line of fire, or needs good counter items to keep him in the front of the fight. Items such as Mekansm or Lotus Orb.<br/>Since Omniknight is a melee support, he is incapable of harassing enemy off-laners effectively, and in turn can be prevented from supporting his lane through enemy harass.<br/>Silences are one of Omniknight's greatest weaknesses past the laning stage, as he must be able to cast his abilities in order to impact teamfights. Pre-emptively casting Repel on yourself can prevent the enemy from disabling you, although good positioning also stops enemies from initiating on Omniknight.<br/>Beware that while Omniknight's spells are very strong and can change the course of teamfights, Guardian Angel can be purged. This makes dispels that affect a large area, such as Tornado and Dispel Magic, one of Omniknight's greatest weaknesses, since it will negate his ultimate entirely when targeted properly. Also, dispels from items like Diffusal Blade and Eul's Scepter of Divinity will remove the buff from a single unit.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Purification</h4>Purification is usually maxed out first.<br/>Used offensively, Purification can be used as a damage nuke. Casting the spell on an ally who is engaging an enemy at melee range can cause up to a 600 HP difference shift between the two, often enough to completely change the situation in favor of your team.<br/>The target for Purification does not always have to be an allied hero. Used in-lane, Purification can be cast to gain last-hits, or to harass melee enemies by dealing pure damage to them as they attempt to last-hit. However, both abilities are best reserved for the off-lane as profligate nuking can push the creep wave towards the enemy tower.<br/>Keep in mind, at low levels Purification does not heal very much and costs a moderate amount of mana. Therefore, it is not recommended to use it solely for topping up a teammate during the laning phase after taking damage from enemy harass, but rather in dire situations where you want to save an ally from death, need a pure damage nuke to finish an enemy, or both at the same time.<br/>Remember that Purification cannot be cast on spell immune allies, so casting Repel first prevents you from healing them. If there is enough time, cast Purification on an ally first, then Repel.<br/>Purification has a faster cast time than Omniknight's other spells, requiring 0.25 seconds to cast instead of 0.5, and has a longer cast range than Repel. It should be used first on a teammate who has been initiated on, and then followed by Repel if needed.<h4>Repel</h4>Repel is a very powerful spell in that it can be cast on allies in the early game, when nobody on either team has enough gold to purchase a Black King Bar. Use this to your advantage to get off early ganks and win early teamfights by giving your teammates an advantage that they normally would not have.<br/>Due to its utility, at least one value point in Repel can be very strong in the laning stage. It can be used to escape enemy ganks and protect allies who are jumped on, foiling their kill attempts and greatly increasing the survivability of your lane.<br/>Even in the late game, Repel is a very strong ability, as it is capable of removing debuffs from allies prior to granting them spell immunity, as well as being immune from being dispelled itself.<br/>Use Repel on disabled allies who might not have time to activate their Black King Bar.<br/>One of the strongest aspects of Repel is that it not only has a 18 second cooldown, but does not decrease in potency over use. This allows it to be used much more frequently, and in all types of situations. Using Repel during a gank can allow a teammate to initiate without fear of being disabled and the target escaping, using it during an initiation can allow a teammate who has a BKB to save it for later or to extend the duration of spell immunity further, and using it during an escape can save a teammate whose Black King Bar may be on cooldown, increasing their odds of survival.<br/>At maximum level, Repel lasts for 7 seconds and has a 18 second cooldown. This can be useful in the late game when a Black King Bar has been reduced to its minimum duration of 5 seconds.<br/>Use Repel on a carry or initiator before engaging a teamfight.<br/>Use Repel on yourself to safely venture into hostile territory when placing wards.<h4>Degen Aura</h4>The greatest use for Degen Aura is as an enemy inhibitor, both when initiating on an enemy and escaping. The movement speed slow can prevent an enemy from easily running away, or stop them from easily chasing, and the attack speed slow can reduce the enemy's ability to use physical attacks to deal damage.<br/>In practice, Degen Aura can only be constantly utilized by directly engaging an enemy with Omniknight's attacks. While the debuff persists for 1 second after an enemy leaves its radius, the aura's small radius means that Omniknight must get very close to them in order to affect them with it.<br/>Despite its small numbers, Degen Aura's greatest strength is that the slow can be stacked with other slows, and Omniknight does not need to expend any mana or target enemies in order to inflict them with the debuff. This allows it to always be a factor in battles where Omniknight is present.<br/>When inflicting an enemy with Degen Aura, the most efficient way to slow them down is to get close enough to apply the debuff to them, and then walk ahead of them to body-block their path and apply any attack modifiers that may slow them further. In escapes this can prevent them from easily chasing a low-health ally, and in ganks it can stop the enemy from getting away.<h4>Guardian Angel</h4>Since it is one of the few abilities that grant immunity to physical damage, Guardian Angel can turn the tide of many battles. However, it also has a very long cooldown, so be sure to reserve it for the right occasion.<br/>Guardian Angel is very effective against any ability that deals physical damage; for example, it can be used to negate Omnislash or Exorcism.<br/>Combined with spell immunity from Repel, heroes can achieve full immunity towards physical and magical damage. Do not worry about casting it before your carries used their Black King Bar or other spell immunity granting spells, since they cannot dispel it.<br/>In general, it is better to use Guardian Angel too early than too late, as Omniknight or his allies may perish before he is able to cast it.<br/>Guardian Angel becomes a global ability should Omniknight have an Aghanim's Scepter on him, allowing him to cast it upon his teammates no matter where he is on the map.<br/>In a very desperate situation and with Aghanim's Scepter, Guardian Angel can be used to save towers and the Ancient from being destroyed by your opponents, though you have to decide if it is worthwhile to sacrifice the ability for saving buildings in lieu of a team engagement. Take note that buildings are only protected against physical damage and will still take damage from abilities like Liquid Fire and Nether Blast.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phoenix is a risk-reward, spell-dependent supportive initiator adept at placing debuffs on a wide area to hamper the enemy team's offensive capabilities and slowly burn their health away. Its abilities let it apply powerful slows, rain down heavy damage over time from a distance, and then cover a large area in a stellar inferno as it collapses into a scorching Supernova. Should enemies fail to destroy or escape it, they will be met with a spell immunity-piercing stun, allowing Phoenix and its allies to take advantage of the enemy and follow up with their other abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Long range on all of its abilities.<br/>Counters auto-attack dependent carries.<br/>Scaling magical damage along with healing.<br/>Capable of inflicting many debuffs on multiple enemies at once.<br/>Deceptively elusive and durable with the right order of spell usage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No true disables.<br/>Has almost no spell immunity piercing effects.<br/>Very ability and mana dependent.<br/>Requires precise and careful positioning, aim and timing.<br/>Low armor and has health costs along with mana costs on most abilities.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Quick timing, good positioning, order and aim are necessary for the perfect initiation as Phoenix. Cast Fire Spirits beforehand, concealing yourself from the enemy team so they will not expect your initiation, then try to Dive through as many enemy units as you can to inflict the movement speed slow debuff. During the Dive, try to cast Fire Spirits on as many heroes as possible and, if available, cast Veil of Discord and Shiva's Guard just right before you cast Supernova. If done in the right order and with quick enough casting, the Supernova would end up right in the middle of the fray, preventing the enemy from stunning you. Most, if not all, enemy units will be afflicted with all your debuffs, taking amplified damage and crippled with the slows, making the Supernova incredibly difficult to kill and/or flee from. Should an enemy stay within the ultimate's area for the whole duration, the enemy could take a total of, more or less, 1850 magical damage (provided the enemy has the base 25% magic resistance, with Veil of Discord's debuff factored in, adding 100 more damage if the +65 Fire Spirits DPS talent is chosen).<br/>Mana, armor and health regeneration are all Phoenix lacks but so direly needs. Consider buying Intelligence items to increase your mana pool, armor-increasing items for more survivability, and health regen items to "refund" the health costs its abilities use.<br/>If playing aggressively as an initiator, Phoenix is best played at either middle lane or offlane, where it can go solo and have as much gold and experience as it can get. Harass your lane opponents with your debuffs to prevent your opponents from obtaining last hits and denying you from your own.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>General</h4>Remember to keep at least 310 mana on Phoenix at all times, so that you have enough to use Fire Spirits and Supernova should the need arise. Try not to waste too much mana with your spells as lacking these abilities to use can make escaping difficult if Icarus Dive is unavailable. Defend yourself by activating Fire Spirits, applying them quickly to enemies and then cast Supernova to protect yourself. If done right, you will be reborn with refreshed abilities, health and mana, as well as stunned opponents, letting you Dive away to safety.<br/>Phoenix' non-ultimate abilities are very weak at level 1. Try to get to level 3 first to obtain a level 2 Fire Spirits/Sun Ray to harass the enemy with. Supernova is also rather fragile at level 1, so great caution must be taken when using the ability at low levels.<br/>All of Phoenix' abilities, except for its ultimate, have health costs along with mana costs (except Icarus Dive). With this in mind, be wary of the enemy team if you're spamming abilities in a lane. While the health costs are always based on your current health (and therefore, you can never kill yourself with it), it will decrease your health to a considerable amount from full, making you a tempting target for a gank. As such, ward your jungles (or ask an ally to do so), or simply have an escape prepared should you find yourself ambushed.<br/>Phoenix does not have any targeted abilities and have very good range and radii, making it good for area denial, scouting or teamfight contribution all from a safe distance.<br/>Phoenix does the most damage when it manages to apply all its debuffs (and any of those from items it has bought) onto its target, slowly whittling them down. Being highly dependent on debuffs, be wary of enemies that have dispelling abilities like Press the Attack or Aphotic Shield.<h4>Icarus Dive</h4>Icarus Dive has no mana cost, meaning it can be used any time it's off cooldown and not silenced.<br/>Be wary of silences while Diving, as it will prevent you from cancelling the dive and result in you turning back to where you started.<br/>Also take care of roots, as this prevents you from casting the Dive. However, getting rooted during the Dive does not cancel it.<br/> You can attack, use abilities and items while Diving. Try to finish off an enemy by applying its debuff, getting to land a few attacks and perhaps use other abilities/items such as  or , then let yourself circle back to your original location.
<br/>Phoenix does not need to turn to use abilities/items while Diving, so they can be used in quick succession regardless of where you are in the Dive.<h4>Fire Spirits</h4>Always try to apply the Fire Spirits debuff on all enemy Heroes before using Supernova, so that destroying it will at the very least, be slow to make the most use of it.<br/>Remember that Fire Spirits does not stack with itself. Try to spend the four spirits wisely so that you can make most of the ability for its entire duration.<br/>The spirits have a fixed movement speed, and therefore take some time to reach their destination. Try to lead your aim so that it can hit a moving enemy, or try to predict where the enemy might move to next. This also means that firing the spirits from its maximum distance (especially if cast range is increased) will delay their impact further compared to firing from a closer distance.<br/>The attack speed slow can be enough to completely nullify an auto-attacker Hero for a meanwhile. If you are suddenly ganked, try to apply the debuff on your assailants, and perhaps try to turn the fight around or escape.<br/>The attack speed slow also works on Roshan. Accompany an ally and help out by casting it on Roshan, making sure to use the Spirits one after the other's debuff to make full use of them.<h4>Sun Ray</h4>Reserve Sun Ray for healing purposes or if there is a fleeing enemy within reach. Sun Ray is fairly weak when the enemy is at or is close to full health.<br/>The damage/heal increases the longer the Ray is activated, so try to keep the Ray pointed at an enemy/ally for maximum efficiency.<br/>Sun Ray's heal is not as quick acting as other heals, therefore it is best to be used while an ally is being attacked at full health instead of using it as a last-ditch save attempt.<br/>Sun Ray gives vision along its path. Use it to scout areas such as Roshan's pit, above cliffs, or the juke areas inside trees where enemy Heroes would tend to hide in.<br/>Be careful of the enemy team when you're channeling the Sun Ray. Even with the toggled movement, you are a very easy target for skillshots like Meat Hook or Sacred Arrow. Try to hide behind allies or be in a hard to reach area so you cannot be hit by such spells while still contributing to fights.<br/> When movement is toggled on, Phoenix can fly over cliffs and destroy trees, as well as be unaffected by any sort of slows. Depending on the situation, it can be used to escape a gank or a failed teamfight to get yourself to safety. You can use it to fly over  or , to break free from 's leash or , or to ignore the slows from  or . During the toggled movement, you are also immune to  like  and ; however, beware of , as even though it is also a rooting ability, it applies a ministun upon cast, so it  stop the movement, but it won't prevent it.
<br/>Phoenix can still cast abilities and items while firing the Sun Ray. A wise escape tactic can be to toggle the Ray's movement on (preferably through a cliff) and then teleport back to base while moving so enemies may have a harder time trying to stop you from escaping.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Pudge is a fearsome ganker and one of the most renowned heroes in all of Dota. Played skillfully, he can dis-position enemies and set up kills for his team that would be otherwise impossible to accomplish.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has a respectable health pool early game that grows even bigger later on.<br/>Very good ganker and roamer in the early game.<br/>One of the best tanks in the game, capable of being resistant to both magic and physical damage in late part of the game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low armor at the early stages of the game.<br/>Sometimes he's very dependent on his teammates.<br/>Requires skills to land a normal hook, if playing as initiator-tank, a fail hook that supposed to initiate the battle could ruin the whole team fight<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>With his poor base armor and agility, Pudge is quite vulnerable to physical damage in the early game despite being a strength hero, and can be easily harassed down due to being a melee hero. As well, his extremely long attack animation makes him additionally easy to harass by lane opponents, so good positioning and knowledge of creep mechanics is necessary to survive in a lane.<br/>Because of his extremely powerful spells, Pudge is heavily reliant on building up his mana pool and increasing his poor mobility in order to be effective in teamfights. Try to build items that grant Pudge additional movement speed and burst movement to aid in positioning, intelligence items to increase the size of his poor base mana pool, and durability items to take advantage of his high strength growth.<br/> Given his skill set, Pudge can be played in any number of ways.
<br/>Traditionally, Pudge is played as a solo mid. While he is generally a weak laner due to being a melee hero, judicious and skillful use of his abilities lets him turn the tables on his lane opponent and score kills to give him an advantage. By being given solo experience and gold, Pudge can get an early level 6 and immediately begin roaming for kills, using his gold to purchase items to aid him to this effect.<br/>Given his strong utility and high strength gain, Pudge can sometimes be played as an off-laner, both solo and with a lane partner. While he lacks the survivability and escape abilities of traditional off-laners, he can greatly disrupt the enemy safe lane with Meat Hook, which can get kills on the enemy supports under optimal circumstances. If partnered with a teammate with good kill potential, Pudge can foul the enemy carry's attempts to farm safely and reduce their effectiveness later in a match.<br/>Lacking other options, Pudge can serve as a strong utility support in the safe lane. While he is unable to effectively harass the enemy off-laner with his spells, he can dis-position them with Meat Hook and slow them with Rot during ganks and kill attempts, giving his team early kills to boost their gold gain. He can also safely and reliably obtain gold and experience through pulling creep camps, which keeps lane creep equilibrium closer to his team's tower where he can more easily get in position to gank them.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Meat Hook</h4>Meat Hook launches a hook that latches onto the first target it contacts, pulling them to his location and dealing Pure damage if it is an enemy or neutral.<br/> Meat Hook is one of the most difficult abilities to use in all of Dota due to the hook's slow travel time, but can be very rewarding as it can put an enemy in an extremely disadvantageous position. Good practice and prediction is mandatory in order to catch enemy heroes with it.
<br/>As it deals Pure damage and increases in range as it is leveled up, Meat Hook should generally be the first spell that Pudge maxes out. As well, reducing its cooldown can allow Pudge to cast it more than once in a single engagement, using the spell to catch an enemy and again as a finishing nuke.<br/>The most reliable way to utilize Meat Hook is to cast it from the enemy Fog of War, in order to give them as little time to react as possible. Use treelines, high ground and nighttime to mask Pudge's position.<br/>Because it mini-stuns an enemy target upon contact, Meat Hook can be a very strong spell for interrupting channeling abilities, as its long cast range allows Pudge to target enemies that could otherwise be out of range of other disables. In particular, it can be used to interrupt Town Portal Scroll and stop an enemy from escaping.<br/>What makes Meat Hook so hard to land is that it is capable of latching on to creeps, which makes the skill extremely hard to use in-lane when the enemy also has vision on Pudge's location at all times. As well, it is able to latch on to allied heroes, which can foul teamfights by dispositioning a teammate who wishes to close the distance with the enemy.<br/>Good communication with teammates is mandatory in order to take utmost advantage of Meat Hook. Communicating your intentions with allies ensures that they do not accidentally walk into Pudge's line of fire, and teammates can aid him by landing initiating stuns that allow him to reel in a stationary target. As well, they can position themselves to take advantage of a successful hook, immediately jumping on and bringing down the target.<br/> Be mindful that while Meat Hook can still catch and damage spell immune enemies, it does not mini-stun them. If a spell immune enemy is attempting to teleport away, other disables must be used to interrupt them, particularly your ultimate.
<br/>Meat Hook's ability to disposition enemies precisely allows Pudge to aid various teammates in getting kills with otherwise unreliable nukes and disables. For example, standing on top of a large Techies trap can virtually guarantee a kill, while standing in the path of an allied Sacred Arrow can guarantee landing a full-duration stun. Make sure to coordinate with your allies in order to make the most of your ability.<br/>In a pinch, Meat Hook can be used to save allies and not just capture enemies. Targeting allies who are disabled and being focused down by the enemy team can bring them back to a location of safety.<br/>Be careful about the types of enemies you decide to target with Meat Hook, and be especially careful about Pudge's positioning relative to his teammates when doing so. Catching an enemy initiator with a large area disable like Ravage or Reverse Polarity can allow them to disable Pudge's entire team in a worst case scenario. Make sure that the target cannot easily use their new positioning to their advantage, and check on allies' positioning to ensure that they cannot be caught by enemy area disables.<br/>Unlike other disables, Meat Hook can still latch on to invulnerable units, although it does not mini-stun or damage them. This means that it is capable of pulling units out of cyclone, and even manipulating units through Song of the Siren.<br/>In the laning phase, Meat Hook can be used to disposition neutral creeps in order to alter lane creep equilibrium. Hooking a neutral creep to bring it closer to Pudge's lane can draw lane creep aggro, pulling them back to the neutral camp and denying experience and gold to Pudge's lane opponent(s). Beware, however, that Meat Hook's tremendous mana cost and Pudge's meager base mana pool means that it is necessary to utilize Clarity to this effect.<h4>Rot</h4>Rot slows and damages enemies in melee range while also dealing the same damage to Pudge.<br/>Rot allows Pudge to immediately start damaging and slowing any enemies he catches with Meat Hook, preventing them from easily escaping once caught. The slow also gives Pudge a strong movement speed advantage, countering his low base movement speed and allowing him to easily keep them inside the gas cloud.<br/>As a disable and damage nuke, Rot is a good candidate for a spell to be maxed out early next to Meat Hook. The slow and damage can greatly increase Pudge's kill potential in the early game.<br/>If self-damage is a concern, one value point in Rot can allow Pudge to retain his disable potential, as the slow is the same at all levels.<br/>Rot can act as a last-hitting aid, either by getting a creep within last-hit range or by finishing it off shortly after attacking. Toggling Rot during last-hitting can help Pudge to more easily get gold from last-hits, although a source of HP replenishment is also necessary to mitigate the spell's cost.<br/>As items and spells are queued during Meat Hook's cast backswing, Rot can be cast during Meat Hook's travel time, so that it immediately turns on as the hook starts to retract. This can be a useful time-saver for having Rot ready to greet a hook victim.<br/>In a pinch, Rot can be turned on to deny Pudge in a hopeless situation. Preventing the enemy from profiting from his death can delay them from progressing their items.<br/>Keep in mind that Blink Dagger goes on cooldown if Pudge takes damage from Rot. Try to avoid using Rot if you believe that you might need to blink in the near future.<br/>Beware that if Pudge is silenced, Rot cannot be toggled on or off. Being silenced with Rot turned on can cause Pudge to take unnecessary damage from the spell, and make him easier to kill.<br/>As Rot deals its damage in 0.2 second intervals, it is possible to have active Healing Salve, Clarity or Bottle at the same time as Rot up to level 3, provided that no other sources of damage cancel them.<br/>Due to how Rot's damage timings are, it is possible to rapidly toggle Rot on and off several times to drastically reduce damage dealt/taken while still maintaining the slow. This is mainly possible thanks to debuff lingering for 0.5 seconds on all enemies, causing them to get slowed for at least 0.5 seconds, even when Rot was toggled on for shorter. Also, since the damage is also bound to the debuff, they also take at least 2 damage instances from the debuff.<h4>Flesh Heap</h4>Flesh Heap grants Pudge bonus magic resistance and extra strength based on enemy hero deaths around him.<br/>Flesh Heap, with enough stacks, can greatly increase the effectiveness of Rot and Dismember. The additional magic resistance reduces the amount of self-damage Pudge takes from Rot; the strength stacks give him more overall HP for casting Rot, and increase the strength-based damage portion of Dismember.<br/>Because it is retroactive, and only becomes effective with enough stacks, Flesh Heap is a poor ability to put points into in the laning stage, and should generally be reserved for after Meat Hook and Rot are maxed out. Pudge always gains the full benefits of all previous kills/assists, and all stacks always use the current level of Flesh Heap for rewarding bonus strength.<br/>Keep in mind that Pudge does not have to get the kill himself in order to gain a stack of Flesh Heap. Assisting in kills, or simply walking within radius of an enemy hero as they die is enough to gain a stack, so showing up to teamfights is greatly beneficial to Pudge, even if his contribution is minimal.<br/>Pudge still gains Flesh Heap stacks outside of its radius if Pudge himself is credited for the kill. This means that killing an enemy with a long ranged Meat Hook, or finishing them off with an Urn of Shadows charge, can still reward Pudge with a stack.<h4>Dismember</h4> Dismember is a channeled disable that deals damage over time to its target based on Pudge's strength, while also healing him for the duration of the channel.
<br/>After catching an enemy with Meat Hook, casting Dismember on them with an active Rot can deal tremendous damage to them, and hold them in place for allies to focus them down. The self-heal from Dismember easily counteracts the damage that Pudge takes from Rot, and makes him harder to bring down if the enemy does not have any stuns or silences to interrupt him.<br/>The self-heal from Dismember is independent from the amount of damage that Pudge deals with the spell; even if the target has high magic resistance or otherwise takes no damage from Dismember, Pudge always heals for the full amount based on the duration of the channel.<br/>Dismember can stun its target through spell immunity, so it is a good way to stop an enemy in their tracks even if it deals no damage. Disabling them can waste the duration of their Black King Bar, and reduce its effectiveness later in the match.<br/>Keep in mind that Rot can be toggled without breaking the channel. If Rot was not activated prior to casting Dismember, or it needs to be stopped to prevent Pudge from killing himself, it can still be toggled during an active Dismember.<br/>Be mindful that strong dispel can still break a Dismember target out of stun, so abilities like Kraken Shell, Dark Pact and Aphotic Shield can end the channel prematurely. Choose your targets carefully and time the use of the disable so that it does not get wasted.<br/>Dismember provides True Sight over the target for the duration of the channel, meaning that it can catch enemies during invisibility fade time. However, keep in mind that they still turn invisible at the end of the channel, so be sure to carry detection when needed.<br/>If Dismember was cast on an enemy without using Meat Hook, it can be shift-queued to immediately cast at the end of the channel to finish off a target as a Pure damage nuke. This also applies to active item abilities, which can be used to immediately disable a target at the end of a channel if needed.<br/>In a pinch, Dismember can be cast on enemy and neutral creeps in order to restore Pudge's health should the need arise. However, be mindful of the spell's mana cost and try not to use it if you believe that it could be needed in an upcoming gank.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sand King is an Initiator, escaper, and a carry if you have enough gold to do so.He suffers from low initial damage but compensates with his semi-nuke passive (An attack modifier).<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Stuns that can be used as both, initiation and escape<br/>Provides a good AoE in the game which is devastating early-game<br/>Great in laning phases with his passive<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has little health pool that can be taken advantage of by nukes<br/>Ultimate scales poorly into late game<br/>Low mana pool makes spellcasting in early game difficult<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Generally, Sand King is played as a support hero who transitions into an initiator-utility once the laning stage ends. As such, he generally performs support duties for his team during the laning stage, such as purchasing Observer Wards and/or the Animal Courier, as well as upgrading the courier and purchasing Smoke of Deceit when needed.<br/>If needed, Sand King can also be played as an early off-laner, as Burrowstrike and Sand Storm offer him measures of escape, and he generally needs levels before he can farm for gold to get his items. Even if he does not get farm in the off-lane, reaching level 3 or 4 can allow him to transition into his jungle to farm neutral camps with Sand Storm.<br/>Sand King's greatest strengths are his instant cast times and high-mobility spells that allow him to initiate or escape without worrying about cast animations. He can be a very deadly ganker who is nearly impossible to escape, or an extremely slippery target who can evade even the most determined ganks.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Burrowstrike</h4>Burrowstrike is a very strong initiating spell that can instantly disable a target while also displacing Sand King. It is generally the skill that Sand King picks first and maxes out by level 7, as it disables its target for over 2 seconds at all levels and can be used for initiating and escaping.<br/>Be mindful that while Burrowstrike is a Pseudo-Blink spell, it has a deceptively short range, especially at level 1. As such, it requires Sand King to get very close to his target before casting.<br/>Remember that Burrowstrike can displace Sand King over impassible terrain, such as cliff faces. As such, the spell can be used to traverse cliffs to chase or escape, giving Sand King extremely strong mobility starting at level 1.<br/>Part of what makes Burrowstrike so deadly is that it is a unit-target spell, allowing Sand King to reliably stun any unit within the spell's radius with zero warning. Combined with a Blink Dagger, Sand King is capable of instantly stunning any enemy within 2000 range, giving them no opportunity to cast any escape spells.<br/>In the same vein, the combination of Blink Dagger and Burrowstrike can make Sand King extremely mobile, as he effectively has two blink spells at his disposal. Combined with the ability to traverse unpathable terrain, Sand King can chase or escape without limit.<br/>It is a good and deadly by first stun and use the ultimate.<h4>Sand Storm</h4>Sand Storm is a channeled spell that summons a sandstorm to deal damage in a radius around Sand King while providing him with invisibility.<br/>Against opponents without detection, Sand Storm is a very strong evasion spell as it can shield Sand King from physical attacks and unit-targeted spells. However, beware that area-targeted disables, particularly stuns and silences, can still hit Sand King and interrupt the channeling, moreso since Sand King must remain stationary in the center of the storm while channeling.<br/>Sand Storm can be a strong escape spell in the early game due to the invisibility, as opponents may not have detection to target you. However, it is unwise to rely on this to protect you as smart opponents will bring detection if they come to gank you.<br/>Once Sand Storm is level 2 or higher, Sand King can use the spell to jungle, as the damage it deals is enough to allow Sand King to kill large jungle camps reliably. The invisibility the spell grants him allows him to damage the creeps without taking any damage himself, and Sand Storm itself costs small amounts of mana and decreases greatly in cooldown as it is leveled. This can allow Sand King to reliably farm up an early Blink Dagger if his jungle is not already taken and his safe lane does not need any assistance.<br/>Remember that Sand Storm will retain a 1.5 second invisibility buff on Sand King and keep the sand cloud up for the same duration once Sand King stops channeling the spell. This can be used to misdirect foes and give you time to escape, since they may attempt to target the center of the sand cloud while you are already moving away.<br/>If there is no detection nearby, Sand Storm can be used to disjoint spells and projectiles. This is particularly strong since Sand Storm has an instant cast time, as well as an extremely short cooldown at level 4, allowing Sand King to use it to mask his movements without breaking stride.<br/>When initiating with your Epicenter-Burrowstrike combo, it can be smart to add Sand Storm to your combo since it deals a surprising amount of damage at level 4, so even channeling it for one second can add at least 100 damage.<h4>Caustic Finale</h4>Caustic Finale is generally considered to be Sand King's weakest early-game ability, however it is a deceptively strong one that gives Sand King immense nuking power once he has enough levels in it.<br/>Caustic Finale's greatest strength is that it allows Sand King to deal magic nuke damage simply by using his right-clicks, and without the need to expend any mana. Additionally, the amount of nuking damage the spell deals scales linearly with the number of creeps that Sand King attacks, meaning that he can deal upwards of 1100 magic damage inside of a few seconds by attacking only 5 creeps and finishing them off to trigger the on-death explosion. This makes Sand King an extremely strong pusher and counter-pusher who can single-handedly stop even a lane of Mega-Creeps from pushing into his base.<br/>Caustic Finale can be a very good flash-farming spell, allowing Sand King to add even more nuke damage when farming creep waves. With an early level in Caustic Finale and combined with Sand Storm, Sand King can clear creep waves and jungle camps surprisingly quickly.<br/>Never discount the slowing power of Caustic Finale. If you manage to catch an enemy near creeps, initiate with Burrowstrike and then apply Caustic Finale to any nearby creeps as well as the enemy player before channeling Sand Storm. This will not only increase the amount of nuke damage they take, but also slow them down for your teammates to catch up and finish the job.<br/>In the laning stage, Caustic Finale can be a strong pickup if you are against a melee enemy hero, particularly when playing in the off lane. By applying the debuff to all of the enemy's creeps, you can threaten not only a slow, but also a tremendous amount of magic damage to the enemy any time they walk up for last-hits. This also has the further effect of pushing your creep wave into the enemy tower, forcing them to tank creep attacks and fight against their own tower for last-hits.<h4>Epicenter</h4>Epicenter is Sand King's signature ability and one of the most iconic and devastating spells in all of Dota. While it has an extended channeling time and can be easily interrupted, it has a tremendous amount of lockdown and deals large amounts of damage if it can be successfully cast, allowing Sand King to wipe entire teams by himself under the right circumstances.<br/>The key to getting a successful Epicenter off involves getting a Blink Dagger and shift-queuing orders. Begin channeling Epicenter, then shift-queue your Blink Dagger and then Burrowstrike during the 2-second channeling time (as well as any other spells and items such as Veil of Discord and Shiva's Guard). Once the channeling is finished, Sand King will take advantage of his instant cast times to immediately blink into range and then Burrowstrike without delay, stunning the enemy at the same instant that they begin taking the brunt of the Epicenter damage. This can be followed up with a channeled Sand Storm to deal even more damage.<br/>If time and targets permit, try to use Sand King's attacks to apply Caustic Finale to any creeps caught in an Epicenter initiation. Simply inflicting them with the debuff will greatly increase Sand King's nuking power during an initiation, as the creeps will have already been inflicted with Burrowstrike damage and are under the effects of Epicenter, ensuring their quick demise and dealing the full damage to all enemy heroes in the area. The Caustic Finale slow, combined with that of an active Epicenter, will ensure that any enemy heroes caught within its radius will not easily escape.<br/>An effective early-game combo for killing solo targets involves using Burrowstrike on an enemy so they end up facing away from you, and then immediately channeling Epicenter. If done correctly, the enemy will be unable to turn around to stun you out of the channel, and will almost certainly guarantee a kill. You should discontinue this around mid game, however, as you will need to save your ultimate for teamfight situations.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Slardar is a physical damage-based carry who specializes in chasing down and crushing his foes. While he is very straightforward and easy to learn, mastering his abilities can allow players to unlock his true potential.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High Physical Damage<br/>Powerful Carry potential<br/>High Armor and fast attack speed<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Sluggish Mobility<br/>Quite item dependent<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Bash of the Deep average stats (hero)<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Guardian Sprint</h4>Guardian Sprint is a costless spell that greatly increases Slardar's movement speed, at the cost of increased damage taken from incoming attacks.<br/>As a mobility spell, Guardian Sprint is a good spell to max out early in a match, as the increased movement speed can allow Slardar to more easily chase down enemies or escape ganks, important for increasing his gold gain or preventing gold loss in the early game.<br/>Guardian Sprint is primarily used to close the distance to a foe in order to land a successful Slithereen Crush, particularly in the early game if an enemy is caught out of position. It is also a strong mobility spell that allows Slardar to quickly traverse between lanes or reach a combat area faster, and can save him time and mana due to negating the need to use a Town Portal Scroll.<br/>Because it provides phased movement while it is active, Guardian Sprint allows Slardar to ignore unit collision while pursuing or fleeing enemies. When chasing foes, this allows Slardar to simply run through impeding creeps, as well as the target itself, to get ahead to stun them with Slithereen Crush. When fleeing, Slardar can run straight through creep waves, forcing enemies to path around and possibly lose him.<br/>With its low cooldown and high active duration, Slardar is able to use Guardian Sprint to be very active on the map, as it has a 5 second downtime at all levels.<br/>Be mindful of the increased damage taken while Guardian Sprint is active, as casting it at the wrong time can leave Slardar open to enemy attacks, particularly if he is hard-disabled and is unable to easily escape the enemy. It can sometimes be smarter to pursue an enemy without Guardian Sprint, and reserve it for clearing the area.<br/>In the most optimal case, try to cast Guardian Sprint as early as possible when pursuing foes. By using the bonus movement speed to close the distance early on, Slardar can reach the target faster and allow the buff to expire sooner, giving the enemy no window to take advantage of the increased damage taken. When escaping, try to use your judgment, as casting Guardian Sprint too early can allow the enemy to hit you with a ranged nuke for increased damage before you can escape, while casting it too late can allow the enemy to catch up and disable Slardar, preventing him from escaping at all.<h4>Slithereen Crush</h4>Slithereen Crush is a basic disable that stuns all enemies in an area around Slardar, dealing physical damage and slowing them for a short time at the end of the stun.<br/>Because its damage and stun duration both increase with level, Slithereen Crush should be Slardar's first skill that he maxes out. Increasing its damage and stun duration gives Slardar and his allies increased chance of securing early kills if he is able to land the stun on an enemy.<br/>In order to reliably stun enemies with Slithereen Crush, a Blink Dagger is absolutely crucial. Given good timing and opportunity, Slardar can stun multiple enemies with a single cast, making him a strong team initiator.<br/>With an 8 second cooldown at all levels, Slithereen Crush can allow Slardar to repeatedly lock down enemies as he chases them, especially when combined with Guardian Sprint. Combined with Corrosive Haze and a Blink Dagger, this makes Slardar extremely difficult to escape.<br/>Slithereen Crush is easily Slardar's most expensive spell, so always be sure to cast it carefully. Missing Slithereen Crush can not only result in a missed kill but will also cost Slardar another opportunity at a future kill if he does not have mana replenishment handy. Always make sure to treads switch to intelligence when casting it, in order to reduce the strain that it puts on Slardar's mana pool.<br/>Remember that after the stun, enemies will have their attack and movement speed slowed for a short time. This can render enemies unable to easily fight back or flee, as the movement speed reduction can allow Slardar to more easily body-block their movements, provided that Guardian Sprint is not active.<h4>Bash of the Deep</h4>Bash of the Deep gives Slardar a chance to stun enemies with each attack, dealing bonus physical damage in the process.<br/>Because Bash of the Deep's effectiveness is determined primarily by Slardar's attack speed, it is a poor ability to put skill points into in the early game. Leave it unleveled until both Guardian Sprint and Slithereen Crush are maxed out, as even a value point can foul last-hits.<br/>As it is chance-based per attack, Slardar should focus on building attack speed items for the late game in order to make the most of Bash of the Deep. As his attacks can stun through spell immunity, improving his chances of proccing Bash of the Deep can greatly increase Slardar's lethality against even enemy carries.<h4>Corrosive Haze</h4>Corrosive Haze debuffs the target enemy's armor, greatly reducing their resistance to all sources of physical damage.<br/>Corrosive Haze is an extremely strong single-target debuff, capable of rendering even the toughest hard carry unable to withstand attacks from Slardar and his team. As well, it is the linchpin that amplifies the strength of all of Slardar's spells, as both Slithereen Crush and Bash of the Deep deal physical damage.<br/>Because of its spammability, Corrosive Haze can be repeatedly cast before or during a teamfight in order to break multiple enemies' armor. This will soften them up not only for Slardar's attacks, but those of his teammates as well, especially allied carries with high physical damage output.<br/>Remember that Corrosive Haze will provide True Sight over its target, which allows Slardar and his team to see in an area around the enemy and even track them through invisibility. This can allow Slardar to easily pursue and crush enemies that he has cast his ultimate on, even mobile heroes with escape abilities like Bounty Hunter, Riki, Queen of Pain and Puck. Casting Guardian Sprint to chase after enemies, using his own Blink Dagger to traverse impassible terrain, and stopping them in their tracks with Slithereen Crush is what Slardar is best known for once he has gained vision over them with his ultimate.<br/>Beware, even though Corrosive Haze has a very low mana cost, repeated casting can still drain Slardar's mana very quickly. If time permits, treads switching between casts can allow Slardar to have more mana available for future engagements when he may need to cast multiple instances of Slithereen Crush.<br/>Due to its extremely low cooldown, Corrosive Haze can be used as a farming spell to allow Slardar to more easily kill larger jungle creeps. As well, it can be cast on Roshan when taking the Aegis, greatly reducing the time required to kill him, and is a good way to break Linken's Sphere on enemies prior to engagement.<br/>While it is an easily dispellable debuff, Corrosive Haze can be cast on spell immune enemies. Combined with Bash of the Deep, Slardar can be a powerful threat even against enemies with Black King Bar.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Spirit Breaker usually serve as an initiator/ganker/tanker role in the team. His skillset allows/requires player to consistently checking for any ganking opportunity across the map meanwhile helping his team secure space and farm. If he does so, a successful early-mid game Barathrum can snowball into a semi-carry and crush his foes relentlessly, carving a path to victory for his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great ganker thanks to global initiation and durability<br/>Can stunlock a target for a long period of time<br/>Can solo-kill fragile heroes after charging at them from anywhere<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very poor teamfight contribution<br/>Unreliable Bash, mainly due to slow attack speed<br/>Heavily countered by decent vision on the map and sticking together<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Greater Bash average stats<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Charge of Darkness</h4>Use Charge of Darkness to get close, stun your target, and make him vulnerable to your attacks.<br/>Black King Bar can be used without interrupting your charge, activate it just when you get close to the enemy to take advantage of its duration during the fight.<br/>Shadow Blade can also be activated while charging, greatly increasing the surprise factor of his charge and preventing easy charge interruption such as Telekinesis. In addition, the Shadow Blade bonus damage will be applied to the first attack from invisibility.<br/>Charge of Darkness allows Spirit Breaker to run through units, trees, structures and terrain. It does not indicate your enemies when targeted either, letting you setup ganks.<br/>Although Charge of Darkness is typically used to get into fights, it can also be used to get back out in a pinch; by targeting a creep in a different lane Spirit Breaker can move quickly to avoid death, then cancel the charge when he is out of danger.<br/>While it does not provide True Sight the indicator will follow the invisible unit being charged and the Charge will still hit an enemy that has gone invisible after being charged. This will cause the ability to interrupt channeling spells being performed by invisible heroes such as Sand King's Sand Storm.<br/>During teamfights you can spam charge of darkness in order to create chaos and disrupt your oponent's formation, try to target the backliners in order to get the most stuns possible.<h4>Empowering Haste</h4>Empowering Haste active spell increases your move speed, making it handy for reaching the front lines quickly or for quick escapes (for example after charging into enemy territory).<br/>The move speed increase also synergizes with your passive, potentially increasing your damage output for a short time. Consider using it in order to quickly dispose of lone enemy heroes before they acquire backup.<h4>Greater Bash</h4>Greater Bash deals more damage depending on Barathrum's movement speed. Getting items that increase movement speed, such as Sange and Yasha and Drum of Endurance, will greatly improve your damage.<br/>Always try to angle Spirit Breaker in a way that you may push your enemy away from safety, the chances that you will get multiple bashes are slim but should still be considered.<h4>Nether Strike</h4>Nether Strike deals major damage to the target enemy and teleports behind them, wherever they go. You can use this to catch blinking or teleporting enemies before they get away.<br/>Sometimes it might be a good idea to use Nether Strike on a magic immune hero to interrupt their actions as the greater bash will hit them regardless. Situations where for example your team gets caught in a Black Hole by a magic immune Enigma you can turn the tide of the fight if you can stop him right at the beginning.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sven is the embodiment of strength, a mighty front line fighter capable of dealing tremendous physical damage to groups of foes at once. A well farmed Sven can destroy an enemy in just a few hits, overpowering other carries with sheer burst damage. However, Sven is vulnerable to kiting and disables, and generally has a slower attack speed than most carries.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high melee damage.<br/>Good at clearing groups.<br/>Reliable AoE stun.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/>Low attack speed.<br/>Highly dependent on Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Ranged heroes can easily harass Sven in lane. Make sure he is paired with a support hero.<br/>Sven is very easy to shut down with good crowd control. Therefore, Sven players need to know exactly when to use their Black King Bar, and when to conserve the charge.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Storm Hammer</h4>Storm Hammer is one of the best stuns in the game, with a large AoE radius to catch several enemies at once.<br/>Each point in Storm Hammer increases the ability's damage by 75 points of damage. It may be more efficient to spend your skill points into other abilities first if you are not in need of the damage increase early in the game.<br/>Storm Hammer should be used judiciously, as Sven has very low natural mana.<br/>Storm Hammer has a very bright and visible effect, and can be disjointed.<br/>Despite its cast range, it may be useful to conserve Storm Hammer until Sven is relatively close or uses Blink Dagger. This ensures that enemies do not spread apart during the projectile's travel time, and maximizes Sven's time to land hits on the target.<h4>Great Cleave</h4>Sometimes it may be wise to avoid leveling Great Cleave early on, as it will greatly push the lane towards the enemy tower, thus making farming more difficult.
<br/>Later in the game, points in Great Cleave is what will allow Sven to farm quickly.<br/>With enough points in Great Cleave, stacking neutral camps is a viable farming strategy for Sven, as he can clear them fairly easily with most of his skills and gain a gold advantage.<br/>Great Cleave grants Sven a surprisingly long reach for a melee hero. It is possible for you to indirectly harass your opponents through the splash damage.<br/>Take note that the splash damage from Great Cleave is not reduced by armor values. As such, try to target enemies with low armor as it will greatly increase the damage taken by any surrounding opponents.<h4>Warcry</h4>While Warcry should always be used before an engagement, its extra speed and armor can also be used to disengage from a losing fight.<br/>Warcry's armor allows Sven to skip Assault Cuirass sometimes for more aggressive items like Moon Shard.<br/>A high level Warcry allows Sven and his allies to tank physical damage abilities such as Omnislash and Quill Spray.<br/>Warcry's buff is purgeable, so beware of enemy purge skills and Diffusal Blade.<h4>God's Strength</h4>God's Strength is the ability that lets a farmed Sven kill heroes in two or three hits.<br/>God's Strength lasts 25 seconds with only 80 seconds of cooldown, meaning that it can be used outside of teamfights.
<br/>Stacked Ancient creeps are ideal to use God's Strength on.<br/>Use it to quickly take down a tower or barracks and gain a map advantage.<br/>Because of its long duration, don't hesitate to use it "too early" before a fight. Being jumped without God's Strength active is a huge waste of Sven's potential.<br/>God's Strength benefit from items that increase Sven's strength like , not items that increase raw damage.
<br/>Critical Strike from Daedalus still increases the damage a lot.<br/>Coupled with any item source of lifesteal, hits while God's Strength is active can replenish Sven's health very quickly.<br/>Be aware of your opponents' movespeed, abilitiesand inventory when you activate God's Strength, as most heroes will likely kite Sven while he is under the effects of God's Strength.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tidehunter is a very durable hero who brings disables and debuffs to the field. He focuses on debilitating the enemy and shrugging off their attempts to disable and kill him, as he is capable of absorbing a tremendous amount of punishment should the enemy attempt to focus him down to prevent him from inhibiting them in teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>(One of) the best team fight ultimate in the game.<br/>His durability gives you a chance to survive your own mistakes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Not a huge damage output.<br/>Quite mana-dependent in the early game.<br/>Kraken Shell doesn't purge everything.<br/>Better opponents will know when they've got an actual shot at killing you.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of his innate toughness and strong array of debuffs, Tidehunter generally benefits from building mobility items that aid him in initiating with his ultimate (particularly a Blink Dagger), as well as items that improve his ability to cast his spells. Tidehunter's poor intelligence means that he must increase the size of his mana pool if he is to sustain his ability to cast his disables and debuffs.<br/> Tidehunter can be played as an initiator or a tank, or some combination in between.
<br/>Due to the immense disable potential of Ravage, getting a Blink Dagger allows Tidehunter to initiate fights by stunning the entire team for a long duration. After getting off a successful Ravage, he can follow up with Anchor Smash while the enemy is still disabled, reducing their ability to attack effectively, and then Gush to slow any stragglers, preventing them from easily escaping.<br/>While he possesses strong initiating power with Ravage, Tidehunter can also discourage enemies from engaging by standing at the front lines and debilitating their ability to fight. Should the enemy choose to engage him, he can greatly reduce their base damage with Anchor Smash while also shrugging off their attacks and debuffs with Kraken Shell, and threaten them with a Ravage should they all jump on him.<br/> Tidehunter's flexibility allows him to be played either as a safe-lane support or solo off-laner. His skill and item build differs drastically depending on which path is taken.
<br/>Played as a support, Tidehunter should focus on purchasing support items and harassing the enemy's off-laner. Generally he gets his Blink Dagger much later, if at all, due to not being given farm or experience priority. Anchor Smash can discourage the enemy from approaching lest they take damage and have their last-hitting power greatly reduced, and Gush can slow them for chain-disables and kills.<br/>Played as an off-laner, Tidehunter should focus on surviving while also harassing the enemy's carry and supports. Kraken Shell allows Tidehunter to ignore the enemy's harass damage, while he can use Anchor Smash to harass the enemy down and prevent their carry from getting easy last-hits. Off-lane Tidehunter benefits greatly if the enemy's carry (and optionally supports as well) is also melee, as they must approach the creep wave to last-hit, making casting Anchor Smash much easier.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Gush</h4>Gush is a single-target magic nuke that slows its target and reduces their armor on top of the damage.<br/>Gush is a powerful early-game disable, as it slows the target's movement speed by 40% for 4 seconds. During ganks, this can often be enough to slow an enemy enough to catch them with additional disables. As such, no matter what lane Tidehunter is placed in, at least one early point in Gush is highly recommended.<br/>Gush also reduces the target's armor, increasing their vulnerability to not only right-clicks but Anchor Smash as well, since it deals physical damage. Keep this in mind when casting Gush, as it can be used not only as a disable but as an armor debuff to help your carries deal more right-click damage.<br/> When upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, Gush becomes an area-targeted spell that allows it to affect multiple enemies in an area rather than just a single enemy, as well as drastically reducing its cooldown to give it a 57% uptime.
<br/>The area-of-effect upgrade makes Gush extremely powerful for killing creep waves and neutral camps, particularly as the armor reduction softens them up for a follow-up Anchor Smash. This can allow Tidehunter to farm more easily on his down-time, and push lanes by himself.<br/>With its wide area and long travel length, Gush can be used to slow enemies at a distance, allowing Tidehunter and his team to chase them down more easily. It also prevents enemies from evading the spell by juking through trees, as simply casting Gush in their general direction should most often hit them and inflict them with the slow and armor debuff. Used judiciously, it can even be used to put enemy Blink Daggers on cooldown from range prior to initiations.<br/>An upgraded Gush can be a powerful spell to cast following a successful Ravage. Inflicting multiple enemies with the slow and armor debuff can greatly soften them up for teammates, and the greatly reduced cooldown allows Tidehunter to continuously use it to slow them down as they try to escape after a Ravage.<br/>Be mindful that purchasing Aghanim's Scepter prevents enemies from blocking it with Linken's Sphere. While this also prevents the ability from being used to deliberately break Linken's Sphere ahead of a stronger single-target disable, Tidehunter can instead use it to land the slow on the enemy, increasing the window with which teammates have to land further disables.<h4>Kraken Shell</h4>Kraken Shell provides Tidehunter with damage block, as well as removing most debuffs from him once he takes a certain amount of damage.<br/>Kraken Shell is a powerful form of damage block as it has a 100% proc chance. In the off-lane, it is recommended to get at least two early levels in the ability, as this equates to having a Poor Man's Shield that also works 100% of the time against tower and creep attacks.<br/> After taking enough player damage, Kraken Shell applies a  on Tidehunter. This includes not only many powerful debuffs, but stuns as well, drastically increasing Tidehunter's survivability. As such, even in the late game Kraken Shell is a very powerful ability as it prevents Tidehunter from being chain-disabled or permanently silenced, ensuring that he is always ready to cast his spells when needed.
<br/>Be mindful that not every debuff can be purged off. We think most commonly of Doom or Rupture.<br/>You're especially vulnerable to spells that affect a zone for some time, like Smoke Screen or Static Storm.<br/>Kraken Shell's damage threshold decreases as it is leveled up. For this reason, building HP items on Tidehunter greatly increases its usefulness, as Tidehunter can reach the threshold multiple times the more HP he has.<h4>Anchor Smash</h4>Anchor Smash is an area physical damage nuke that inflicts enemies with an attack damage debuff.<br/>Anchor Smash is a great way to clear creeps and farm for Tidehunter. Due to its low Mana cost, it can be used to harass enemies, especially melee heroes.<br/>Anchor Smash's cooldown decreases as it is leveled, and matches the debuff duration at level 2 or higher. Used properly, Tidehunter can keep at least one enemy's attack damage permanently crippled so long as he remains within range of them.<br/>Do not underestimate the 60% damage reduction from Anchor Smash at level 4. If you use it on a hero with powerful basic attacks, such as Ursa, their damage output gets severely reduced.<br/>With enough levels in Anchor Smash and Kraken Shell, Tidehunter can farm ancient creeps fairly reliably, especially if they have been stacked by you or your teammates a few times. Anchor Smash deals physical area-of-effect damage that hits all the creeps simultaneously while also reducing their attack damage, and the damage block from Kraken Shell further reduces any damage that they are able to do, often to zero. This can be useful for giving Tidehunter levels and farm for items at any point in the game, whether it is to help him recover from a bad laning phase or to supplement his gold and experience gain.<h4>Ravage</h4>Ravage is an area nuke that damages and stuns all enemies in an extremely wide radius.<br/>Ravage is your most powerful teamfight ability, as its wide effect radius and long stun duration can completely stop the entire enemy team in their tracks. Use it to initiate or counter-initiate teamfights, but beware its extremely long cooldown, and do not be afraid to hold onto it if you do not think it can drastically benefit your team, even if it means your death.<br/>Remember that while Ravage travels quickly, it does take a brief time to extend to its maximum range. Very alert opponents might be able to blink away or activate spell immunity before they are stunned, so be sure to blink in closer to those heroes to reduce their window of escape.<br/>Should the enemy team have a Rubick, it is critically important to cast another one of your spells (generally Anchor Smash) after Ravage, as an ability so devastating could easily be the deciding factor in a teamfight should Rubick steal it.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Timbersaw is an armored brawler who relies on cutting down trees as a mechanic for rapid movement and dealing damage. In the early and mid stages of the game, Timbersaw can be surprisingly durable, staying in the fight and taking out multiple opponents even on the verge of death. His pure damage penetrates armor and magic resistance, making him deadly against all opponents. However, Timbersaw lacks any true disables, and must rely on his mobility to keep up with his enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Highly mobile.<br/>High armor.<br/>High HP regeneration<br/>Deals pure damage.<br/>High mana capacity.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No disables.<br/>Entirely dependent on abilities to deal damage.<br/>Low HP.<br/>Very dependent on Bloodstone<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One of Timbersaw's weaknesses is his lack of disabling spells; he suffers against heroes that excel at channeling spells to harm their opponents. In this case, equip him with an item that has a quick disable, like Eul's Scepter of Divinity.<br/>Aside from escape, Timbersaw's skill set also makes for good chasing. Cut down trees that get in your way to widen your path and even prevent juking.<br/>The trees summoned by Nature's Prophet through Sprout are still standard trees. As an enemy, you can easily cut them down to escape, or free allies who are trapped within it. As an ally, this can be used to your advantage when escaping (as Nature's Prophet can summon trees in a convenient location for you to use Timber Chain) or when fighting (Nature's Prophet can summon trees closer to you when no other tree is present, so that you can deal pure damage when casting Whirling Death).<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Whirling Death</h4>Use Whirling Death during or right after Timber Chain to deal burst damage.<br/>Try to use Whirling Death next to trees to deal pure damage.<br/> The 15% primary attribute reduction from Whirling Death is particularly devastating to strength heroes, who will lose a large amount of HP from strength reduction, on top of damage taken.
<br/>This makes Whirling Death deceptively powerful against strength heroes, especially in the early game.<br/>The attribute loss also hurts the opponent's ability to get last hits, so make sure to hit them with it whenever possible.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Timber Chain</h4>Timber Chain gives Timbersaw tremendous mobility, and has a very low cooldown.<br/>Use Timber Chain to chase or escape from enemies.<br/>Use Timber Chain on trees across impassable terrain and elevations to pull Timbersaw past them.<br/>Timber Chain makes Timbersaw one of the best tower divers, finishing off enemies and pulling himself out before taking much damage.<br/>Timbersaw can use items like Shiva's Guard while being pulled by Timber Chain.<br/>Timber Chain will cause Timbersaw to suffer the effects of Mana Leak and Rupture. Do not use it when affected by those abilities unless absolutely necessary.<br/>Positioning is important when dealing damage with Timber Chain. Move Timbersaw until the enemy is lined up in the middle, between Timbersaw and a target tree.<br/>It takes a brief moment for Timber Chain to destroy the target tree, meaning that Whirling Death should be used to cut down the target tree just before it is destroyed in order to deal pure damage.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Reactive Armor</h4>An early point in Reactive Armor helps Timbersaw stay in lane.<br/>Aside for tanking damage in team fights, Reactive Armor can also be used as a quick health regeneration boost. You can either visit the small creep camps since they do little damage and come in groups, or tank lane creeps when no enemy hero is present. As long as there are multiple targets attacking you in quick succession, the spell will stack faster, and you will be able to heal faster. Make sure you're receiving damage that is lesser than what you are able to regenerate. Purchasing a Stout Shield will allow Timbersaw to do this more effectively.<br/>Beware sources of break such as Silver Edge, as it will disable Reactive Armor.<br/>Don't be afraid to dive, as Reactive Armor will activate from tower hits.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Chakram</h4>The Chakram travels somewhat slow, so make sure to predict your target's path and cast it ahead of time.<br/>Use Chakram to slow down a fleeing enemy, or leave it behind to deter pursuers.<br/> Use Chakram to cut down entire areas of trees. This has numerous functions.
<br/>To find enemies juking in the trees.<br/>To destroy any potential Eyes In The Forest.<br/>To clear vision in order to spot potential ganks. This is especially useful when laning in the early game, and when attacking a tower.<br/>If you are ready to gank in a side lane and are behind trees, use Chakram to destroy the trees in front of you, then use Timber Chain on the other side of the lane; after this, a well placed Whirling Death can almost ensure a kill in many situations.<br/> When a hero is escaping through only one potential exit, use Chakram to block that path; if successful, the enemy hero will either be forced to run through the blade, losing  immensely and get , or the enemy has to take another route. 
<br/>To further slow the hero down, cast Whirling Death while the hero is in the middle of the Chakram.<br/>Once the Chakram is deployed, position Timbersaw so that the Chakram will hit as many enemies as possible on its return path.<br/>To lengthen the time an enemy spends in the Chakram, try to body block the enemy by standing directly in their path. You can easily get close to the enemy to do this if there is a tree nearby to Timber Chain to.<br/>Chakram synergizes well with multi-target abilities that disable free movement, such as Black Hole, Overgrowth, or even Kinetic Field.<br/>Chakram works very well against heroes with long channeling abilities,such as Shadow Shaman or Witch Doctor. By casting Chakram while they are channeling, they either have to move and cancel their channeling, or stay and take damage.<br/>Chakram can be used while Timbersaw is being pulled with Timber Chain.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tiny is a heavy carry with a large amount of health. He is the only hero in the game that grows as he levels up. In the early game, he uses his Avalanche > Toss combo to gank and deal burst damage. As he acquires more items, Tiny transitions into a full-fledged carry, capable of wiping entire teams with his tree, and demolishing buildings in very little time. With a Blink Dagger, Tiny also makes an effective initiator. However, Tiny is susceptible to disables, and can be shut down by intense harassment in the early game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High early game burst damage.<br/>High late game AoE damage.<br/>Passive counters melee carries.<br/>High damage against buildings.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/>Needs a good early game.<br/>Very bad starting armor and agility growth<br/>Low attack speed without items<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Tiny has high base attack damage, which makes last hitting a breeze.<br/>Tiny suffers from low mana. In the early game, one ability or ability combo will often use up all his mana.<br/>Tiny has poor lane presence and should be supported by another hero if necessary.<br/>Tiny has great strength gain, but poor intelligence and agility gain.<br/>Despite his appearance, Tiny has fairly low armor and can be quite vulnerable to physical attacks.<br/>While Tiny has the potential to be a relentless force in the late game, his scaling process is delicate. Good players must know how to farm well in the early game to keep pace with other carries.
<br/>A poorly farmed Tiny will become a burden to his team in the mid and late game.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Avalanche</h4>Tossed units take double damage from Avalanche, making the two abilities extremely deadly when used together.
<br/>An Avalanche + Toss combo is enough to kill many heroes during the early game.<br/>This effect also occurs if you reverse the order by using Toss and then Avalanche. However, Avalanche has a 0.25 second delay for before the stun and damage begins, which means you have 0.25 seconds to cast Toss after Avalanche for the full damage output, whereas Toss begins instantly and lasts 1.3 seconds. You would have to cast Avalanche 0.05 seconds after casting Toss to get the 0.25 second avalanche delay and the 1 second damage and stun to go through. Doing that in the short time window is very hard, so it is generally recommended to cast Avalanche first in order to do the combo.<br/>Avalanche has a 600 cast range, and its radius is slightly larger than its visual effect.<br/>Use Blink Dagger then Avalanche to initiate onto groups of enemies.<br/>Take note that the damage increase per skill point spent is the least efficient for the last point. Whereas each point increases damage by 80 at levels 2 and 3, the last point increases damage by only 40 at level 4. Depending on the circumstance, it may be more prudent to invest that last point into other skills and avoid maxing it during the early stage of the game.<h4>Toss</h4>Toss must target an enemy/allied unit, meaning that Tiny cannot simply Toss units anywhere on the map.
<br/>If Toss targets the enemy that is going to be Tossed, that enemy will be thrown straight up in the air, and come back down on the same spot.<br/>Toss cannot target buildings, but will damage them if the Tossed unit hits the building within its AoE radius. To do so, target Toss on an enemy unit next to the building.<br/>Toss can be used as an initiation tool by throwing a hero like Earthshaker or Tidehunter into a group of enemies.<br/>When chasing a fleeing enemy, throw an ally that can stun. This will buy Tiny enough time to catch up.<br/>Toss can be used defensively, throwing enemies away from Tiny.<br/>Toss can be used offensively, throwing enemies into Tiny's teammates.<br/>Tiny will Toss the unit closest to him. He cannot directly choose which target to Toss. 
<br/>Be careful not to Toss an ally to his death.<br/>Toss works on spell immune enemies.<br/>Toss will interrupt channeled abilities.
<br/>Coupled with the above, this means Toss is one of few abilities that interrupt channels even if the enemy is using Black King Bar.<br/>Toss will remove the Cold Feet debuff when used on enemies, even when the target is tossed straight up.<h4>Craggy Exterior</h4>Craggy Exterior is not the most effective ability early game, as few heroes attack fast enough to proc the disable, Tiny can purchase inexpensive items like Ring of Protection to help his low armor, and it's better to have stronger nukes earlier on. Because of this, it usually is maxed last.<br/>Craggy Exterior is an excellent passive for interrupting carries that rely on fast attack speed, such as Troll Warlord or Faceless Void. However, the stun is blocked by spell immunity, so be wary around these heroes when their Black King Bar is active.<h4>Grow</h4>Although it may not look like it due to his increased size, Grow makes Tiny move significantly faster.<br/>Grow gives Tiny the highest natural attack damage in the game, at the cost of degraded attack speed. This slow attack speed can be further exploited by enemies with abilities that slow attack speed.<br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Tiny is arguably the fastest building destroyer in the game.<br/>Keep in mind that levels in Grow will increase the damage of Toss, so in most cases it is preferred to max Toss first to maximize early game damage by level 7 or 8.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Treant Protector is a tough support hero who is able to protect and regenerate allies and friendly buildings with his trademark ability, Living Armor. Hiding himself with Nature's Guise and packing a huge bash, he is one of few supports that can sneak past enemy lines to set up ganks and/or initiate a fight by trapping the opposing team in an Overgrowth. Alone, Treant Protector does little damage and requires good teamwork to be effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global range with Living Armor.<br/>Fairly tanky.<br/>Can heal buildings.<br/>Highest base physical damage in the game at Lvl 1.<br/>AoE Magic Immunity piercing root and disarm.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily countered by vision and true sight.<br/>Very dependent on teammates.<br/>Little offensive power (due to high defensive power).<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Treant Protector's attack animation and rate are slow, but pack a huge punch. With a little practice, he can put that power to use and greatly assist his lane partner by denying units.<br/>Because of his high damage and strength, Treant Protector can sometimes jungle weaker creep camps.<br/>Treant Protector is not very mobile and requires careful positioning, especially before a teamfight.<br/>Keep your eyes over the entire game. Treant Protector can keep allies longer in lane, save them from ganks and heal damaged towers with Living Armor.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Nature's Guise</h4>Nature's Guise is a great ganking ability, and owing to the extremely variable nature of this mechanic the enemy team will struggle to use Sentry Wards to prevent this.<br/>At level 4, the stun duration is 2.2 seconds, and the fade time is 3 seconds, which you can make a stun chain.<br/> actives and all of Treant Protector's abilities can be used without breaking  from Nature's Guise.
<br/>Active abilities from items like Shiva's Guard and Scythe of Vyse can be used to surprise and play tricks on opponents, as long as Treant Protector stays near the trees.<br/>Use Nature's Guise to scout and place wards.<br/>Nature's Guise provides a bonus to movement speed. Use it to transverse quickly from lane to lane with the jungles as your routes.<h4>Leech Seed</h4>Leech Seed can be used as an early harassment tool.<br/>Use Leech Seed on an enemy fighting an ally to give that ally a healing advantage.<br/>Leech Seed will heal all allied units in a radius around the target, even after the target has died. Be sure to stay around the corpse if the spell hasn't ended to maximise the healing potential.<br/>You can use it as a small pushing tool by healing your creep wave by targeting a nearby melee creep.<br/>Take note that the healing element of the spell is performed over 6 pulses and that the healing projectiles have a fairly slow travel speed. You will need to pre-emptively cast it early during a battle to ensure you will benefit from the healing, as quick and successive bursts of damage may kill you before you gain any life back from the spell.<h4>Living Armor</h4>Living Armor costs very little mana, and should be used as often as possible.<br/> Though Living Armor's damage block visuals are the same as with items such as  and , it actually blocks all types of damage and not just physical. Bear this in mind as, while it protects against all forms of damage, your opponent can use this against you and whittle away the layers with low-cost spells such as  or .
<br/> Living Armor is expended every time it blocks over 5 damage, meaning that damage over time abilities will erode it very quickly.
<br/>So while each layer is able to block up to a maximum of 80 damage, it will deplete a layer so long as the damage instance is over 5, and effectively lose the other 74 points of damage blocking potential.<br/>Keep an eye on the minimap, as a well-timed Living Armor may make the difference between a farmed team-mate or a farmed enemy. This is especially important during the early game, when heroes are more vulnerable.<br/>If possible, healing the team's jungler during the early game will help that hero greatly.<br/> Always use Living Armor to heal  if no teammate needs it. This makes pushing much harder for the enemy team.
<br/>Whenever there is a siege creep in the wave, casting Living Armor on your towers can be very effective, as the melee and ranged creeps will actively be engaging with one another before turning their sights onto the tower. With the skill at higher levels, and coupled with the innate slow attack speed of siege units, it is entirely possible for Living Armor to outlast the attack and allow the tower to make it out without a single scratch.<h4>Overgrowth</h4>Overgrowth is best used from the invisibility of Nature's Guise.<br/>Overgrowth prevents blinking, and is useful for locking down slippery heroes.<br/> Overgrowth is dispellable, so be aware of enemies with items such as , or skills such as .
<br/>Bear in mind that, while Overgrowth is dispellable, it is able to pierce spell immunity entirely. It may be more prudent to draw your opponents into activating their Black King Bar first before casting Overgrowth, as they will be rendered equally helpless under the effects of Overgrowth even if they are spell immune.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tusk is a very strong initiator who can set up fights on his team's terms. His arsenal of crowd control spells can greatly inhibit enemies during fights and ganks, giving allies a powerful edge. Tusk is a ganking specialist as he can hunt fragile heroes throughout the game. However, his skill and aggressive play style can be a double edge against him when it comes to initiating & chasing fleeing enemies as his ice shard can block his teammates from proceed with the chase and he can roll himself into a counter-ganking trap set up by his opponent. Thus, although his skillset is rather straightforward, player should exercise good judgement before consider initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Quite versatile in role.<br/>Powerful disable abilities, especially his ultimate.<br/>High Movement Speed without Boots.<br/>Specialize in ganking.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Quite weak without Desolator or Shadow Blade<br/>Even though he is a strength hero, he has low health<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Beware that while Tusk is a strength hero with strong disables, his mediocre strength growth means that his HP pool will not improve drastically with levels, which inhibits his ability to survive initiations. As such, Tusk benefits from building durability items to give himself more HP and armor, allowing him to do more in fights.<br/>Tusk's reliance on mana-expensive abilities in order to be effective means that he requires a source of mana replenishment in order to keep him in fights. The low cooldown on all of his abilities except Frozen Sigil means that he can greatly impact fights so long as he has the mana to cast his spells.<br/>Keep in mind that Tusk has a near-instant 0.1 second cast animation, allowing him to get his spells off very quickly. Good reflexes are necessary in order to make the most of Tusk's spells.<br/>Beware that while Tusk has a strong arsenal of disables, all of them are very short in duration. As such, while Tusk is a strong initiator, he cannot lock down enemies solely by himself, and requires additional disablers on his team in order to take advantage of the disruption he creates amongst the enemy.<br/> Due to his strong array of disables and an ultimate that scales with his damage, Tusk can be played in any number of ways.
<br/>Because he can be strong with only levels and does not explicitly require gold, Tusk can be a good support who gets his gold and levels by assisting his carries and setting up kills for them. Because of lack of farm priority, a support Tusk should focus on building cheap utility items and extending the size of his mana pool in order to take utmost advantage of his spells.<br/>Tusk's powerful disables allow him to be played as a roamer who can initiate and set up ganks for teammates. A roaming Tusk is much more active on the map and, given the proper circumstances, can get good gold and levels through kills and assists, hampering the enemy's early game and creating space for his allies to secure an early advantage in a match.<br/>Played as a semi-carry solo off-laner, Tusk can get fast early levels and gold, transitioning into becoming an effective ganker early in a game. He can use his gold to purchase items to give him more fighting power, increasing the potency of Walrus PUNCH! and improving his ability to initiate and survive in fights.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Ice Shards</h4>Ice Shards is a potent nuking spell that deals damage in its path and then creates a barrier at its destination that persists for 7 seconds.<br/>Despite not directly disabling enemies, Ice Shards is considered a very potent disable due to the barrier it creates, which cannot be pathed through except through forced movement items and abilities. Cast properly, Ice Shards can block an enemy's escape path and secure a kill.<br/>Because of its nuking and disabling potential, Ice Shards should be maxed out first among Tusk's abilities. Reducing the cooldown on Ice Shards also allows it to be more readily available for gank opportunities and teamfights.<br/>Ice Shards has an extremely long cast range, able to be cast from just within any enemy's visual range. Take advantage of this by casting it through the Fog of War, or to block an enemy's escape route even when they think that they're safe.<br/>Keep in mind that Ice Shards will form its barrier at the targeted location, so aim and timing are crucial in order to make the most of the barrier. If Ice Shards lands short of its target, it will deal no damage and the barrier will only inhibit pursuers' pathing. If it is targeted too far, then the enemy can simply sidestep the barrier.<br/>The best-case scenario is to target Ice Shards so that its destination lines up exactly with where the enemy will be, trapping them within the barrier. This will force them to walk backwards, towards Tusk and his teammates, in order to escape the barrier.<br/>Try to use the terrain to your advantage when casting Ice Shards. Remember that trees will not be destroyed by the barrier, and that the projectile can travel over cliffs, so you can completely immobilize enemies by using ledges and trees to close up the gaps in the barrier.<br/>Due to its low cooldown, Ice Shards can be used as an imperfect nuke for farming and pushing. The projectile's long cast range allows it to hit multiple neutral camps or creep waves in a single cast.<br/>In a pinch, Ice Shards can be used to hinder pursuers' approach path, forcing them to walk around the barrier. Try to use choke points to your advantage, completely cutting pursuers off.<br/>Remember that Ice Shards provides vision around the projectile, and within the barrier for a short duration after forming. This allows the spell to be used to scout high ground or inside treelines, potentially pinning down any waiting enemies in the process.<h4>Snowball</h4>Snowball is an initiating and mobility spell that lets Tusk close the distance to enemies, bringing teammates along for the ride and damaging and stunning any enemies it hits along the way.<br/>Snowball's primary use is to help low-mobility allies get within melee range of enemies during initiations. This is particularly useful in the early game when powerful allied initiators have not purchased a Blink Dagger yet, as the initiation assist can help to get off powerful but short-ranged area disables such as Slithereen Crush, Berserker's Call, Hoof Stomp, Ravage, and so on.<br/>Next to Ice Shards, Snowball is a strong candidate for a spell to max out early in the game, due to its nuking and disable potential. The damage it deals early in matches makes it a very potent spell to have handy.<br/>In a pinch, Snowball's gathering and rolling time can be used as shelter against enemy attacks and spells. Because units inside the Snowball are invulnerable, it can be used to grant up to 3 seconds of invulnerability to Tusk and any nearby allies, and then stun nearby enemies upon launch.<br/>Be extremely careful about which unit is targeted for Snowball, as highly mobile enemies can simply kite the Snowball back and force Tusk and any allies within to emerge in an extremely disadvantageous position. Try to target slower enemies with no mobility spells or items, or target them from the Fog of War in order to give them as little warning as possible.<br/>Tusk is muted and disarmed during Snowball, but is not silenced, meaning that while he cannot use items or attack, he can still cast spells. This means that Tusk can ready a Walrus PUNCH! while rolling towards a target, or block off their retreat with Ice Shards during approach.<br/>Unlike most other unit-targeted spells, Snowball is not blocked by Linken's Sphere, and will target, chase and stun enemies regardless (beware, Lotus Orb will still reflect the spell upon impact). Use this to your advantage to initiate on slippery foes and use a cheap unit-targeted ability or item to break their Linken's Sphere while they are stunned.<h4>Frozen Sigil</h4>Frozen Sigil summons a flying, controllable ward that reduces the movement and attack speed of all enemies within its radius.<br/>Frozen Sigil applies a strong slowing debuff to all nearby enemies. The sigil can be moved to apply its aura more precisely during a teamfight or to slow enemies who are either fleeing or pursuing.<br/>Due to its poor scaling, Frozen Sigil should generally be maxed out last, however, an early value point should still be taken to provide vision and a ranged slow. Its slows become potent only later in matches when attack speed starts increasing to meaningful values.<br/>Because it is a controllable flying unit, Frozen Sigil should be assigned a command group in order to allow easier positioning of both the sigil and Tusk himself. Both need to be constantly controlled and moved during engagements in order to make the most out of the ability.<br/>Due to its flying movement and vision, Frozen Sigil can be used to scout out enemy movement and dodge enemy attempts to destroy it. In particular, the sigil can be used to safely scout inside Roshan's pit.<br/>Beware that Frozen Sigil grants a substantial gold bounty to enemies who successfully destroy it, so take special care not to feed it to the enemy.<br/>Unlike other wards, Frozen Sigil can be loaded into Snowball and will emerge at the destination; the load command must be issued from Tusk rather than from the sigil. This can be an effective way to save time, as Frozen Sigil's long duration means it will likely persist for longer than the engagement requires. Alternatively, Frozen Sigil may be cast en route to the target, as Tusk is not silenced during Snowball.<h4>Walrus PUNCH!</h4>Walrus PUNCH! allows Tusk to uppercut the target enemy, or the next enemy he attacks when auto cast, stunning them for 1 second and dealing tremendous physical damage, then slowing them for a short duration afterward.<br/>Because Walrus PUNCH! allows Tusk to land a guaranteed 3.5x critical hit on an enemy, it can scale with his physical damage. Increasing Tusk's physical damage or decreasing the enemy's armor will allow him to deal more damage with the ability, which can increase his initiating alpha or finish off enemies at low health.<br/>The spell's greatest strength is that it can uppercut enemies through spell immunity, stunning them even through Black King Bar or abilities like Blade Fury and Repel. This can be useful for interrupting enemy attempts to use Town Portal Scroll during spell immunity to escape, or if they are channeling powerful ultimates such as Death Ward or Fiend's Grip.<br/>In concert to the above, it can be wise to leave your punch in reserve when ganking an enemy. Enemies may attempt to simply teleport to safety after an initiating alpha strike if Tusk lacks damage output or the enemy is very tanky, so saving your ultimate for such situations can prevent them from escaping.<br/>At level 18, its cooldown shortens down to 12 seconds, allowing the spell to be used to start and finish an engagement. Be mindful, however, that its mana cost also increases with level, so be sure to increase the size of Tusk's mana pool to account for this.<br/>Remember that Tusk will always be commanded to attack any enemy that he targets with Snowball upon emerging. Because Tusk can still cast spells inside Snowball, casting Walrus PUNCH! during the approach, or activating auto-cast, will cause him to automatically uppercut the Snowball target upon arriving.<br/> It is an active attack modifier and thus simply modifies Tusk's next attack, meaning that it is not blocked by . However, this also means that it cannot hit units in  form.
<br/>Additionally, it is not affected by blindness or evasion, so the resulting attack will always connect, making it particularly useful against Heroes like Phantom Assassin and Windranger.<br/>As it is an active attack modifier, it cannot be stolen with Spell Steal.<br/>Despite behaving like an active attack modifier, Walrus Punch will trigger all on-cast effects like Arcane Curse.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Underlord is a durable support who takes charge on the battlefield, creating dangerous hazards over large areas, while teleporting his team across the map with Dark Rift. He excels at trapping enemies in a Pit of Malice, and blunting physical damage inside his Atrophy Aura. With the health of a strength hero and the extra damage from Atrophy Aura, Underlord can stand his ground better than most supports. However, Underlord is slow and lumbering, and often suffers from insufficient mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Excellent zoning abilities.<br/>Tankier than most supports.<br/>Reduces enemy damage.<br/>Strong potential for sudden pushes.<br/>Not item dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/>Damage scales poorly into the late game.<br/>Requires good team coordination.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of the long durations on Firestorm and Pit of Malice, Underlord specializes in area denial, zoning enemies out in teamfights.<br/>Underlord does not have a lot of mana. Use his abilities strategically.<br/>Underlord should remain close to his team, and be present at all fights to make good use of Atrophy Aura.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Firestorm</h4>Targeting Firestorm, assuming Underlord is behind Crystal Maiden. A. Low damage. Target quickly walks out of radius. B. Minimal damage. Target sees Firestorm ahead and changes direction. C. Maximum damage. Target must walk through radius.<h4>Pit of Malice</h4>Pit of Malice is especially effective against melee carries.<br/>Due to its long duration, allies can stand around Pit of Malice to use it as a buffer against aggressive attackers.<br/>Use Pit of Malice on chokepoints to block off enemies.<br/>Use Pit of Malice on the edge of high ground to act as a trap, causing enemies without vision to walk into a disable.<br/>Use Pit of Malice to bisect enemy formations and cut off pursuers.<br/>Use Pit of Malice to funnel enemies into a narrow space, forcing them to group up.<br/>Use Pit of Malice as a barrier to stop a charging enemy, such as Spirit Breaker or Slark.<br/>Use Pit of Malice in conjunction with 's cyclone for an easy chain disable.
<br/>Keep an eye on enemies who often buy Eul's Scepter of Divinity, like Death Prophet, Lina, or Puck. Use Pit of Malice underneath them when they cyclone themselves defensively.<br/>Set up Pit of Malice as a trap against initiating heroes, who may blink into and become rooted.<br/>Keep in mind that Pit of Malice is only a . It does not stop enemies from using abilities, items, or attacking targets within their range.
<br/>This means that when retreating, it may be wiser to simply keep running instead of stopping to casting Pit of Malice. Doing so may allow the enemy to get close enough to land a powerful ability, even if they become rooted in the process.<h4>Atrophy Aura</h4>Atrophy Aura provides Underlord with numerous positioning possibilities, which players should keep in mind at all times.<br/>During the laning phase, stand close to enemy melee heroes to lower their damage and make it harder for them to land last hits.
<br/>Denied creeps will also boost Underlord's damage.<br/>Staying near your teammates will not only protect them from nearby attacks, it will also give you bonus damage from any enemies they kill.<br/>Move towards dying enemies to collect Atrophy Aura's damage bonus.<br/>Move towards attacking enemies to reduce their damage and potentially save an ally.<br/>While most supports stay in the backline, Underlord can try and take a more forward position to cover enemies with Atrophy Aura.
<br/>Balance this strategy when faced with dangerous situations, as a dead Underlord is no good to his team.<br/>Atrophy Aura is most effective against heroes that rely on stats for damage, such as Drow Ranger.<br/>Atrophy Aura allows Underlord to farm the jungle better than most supports.<br/>Clear a camp or wave of creeps to boost Underlord's damage before an upcoming fight.<h4>Dark Rift</h4>Dark Rift is not a channeled ability, meaning it cannot be interrupted with damage or disables. Underlord can also move after its initial cast animation.<br/>Use Dark Rift as a fast pushing ability right after winning a teamfight.
<br/>Teleport your team to push in a lane while the enemy is down.<br/>Teleport your team to Roshan to claim the Aegis of the Immortal before the enemy respawns.<br/>Use Dark Rift on a unit or creep wave behind the enemy for a wraparound or pincer attack.
<br/>This is especially effective when the enemy team is sieging your tier three towers.<br/>Keep summoned units or enchanted creeps in critical locations, such as the Roshan Pit, for instant access through Dark Rift.<br/>Use Smoke of Deceit along with Dark Rift for more effective team ganks.<br/>Remember that using Dark Rift on the entire team is akin to putting all your eggs in one basket. It can be highly rewarding, but also highly risky. 
<br/>A well placed Dark Rift can take the enemy by surprise or destroy an important building.<br/>A poorly placed Dark Rift can bring your team into an ambush, resulting in a teamwipe.<br/>Make sure that the creep or building you're teleporting to is safe and out of the enemy's reach. 
<br/>Dark Rift's target unit will be marked by a very bright effect that is visible to the enemy.<br/>If the teleport target is killed, Dark Rift is wasted and goes on a long cooldown.<br/>If the enemy has vision of the teleport target, they can easily initiate on your team.<br/>Keep track of enemy wards, and deward when possible to avoid teleporting your team into a bad situation.<br/>Be careful both when casting and exiting Dark Rift, as your closely-packed team presents an easy target for enemy initiators and nukers.
<br/>Since teammates will follow and gather around Underlord for Dark Rift, it is your responsibility to pick a safe location to use it.<br/>Remember that bringing your team to the enemy base also leaves your own base open to attack. Encourage teammates to carry Town Portal Scroll.<br/>Move alongside teammates when retreating to teleport them out to safety.
<br/>Or, cast Dark Rift first, then move next to an ally with Blink Dagger or Force Staff to instantly teleport them to safety.<br/>Use Dark Rift to counter or intercept an incoming gank.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Undying usually serve as a lane support/tanker role in the team. His skillset allows player to harass enemy off the lane meanwhile helping his carry to secure space to farm. Dirge truly shines during every coordinated teamfight due to his plague aura and tombstone, forcing his enemy to either kill him or suffer the debuff consequences.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong harassing ability<br/>Formidable team fight presence<br/>Can play extremely aggressively in the early game<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Relies on items and Decay stacks for durability due to mediocre Strength gain and abysmal Agility gain.<br/>Pathetic scaling into the late game unless incredibly farmed.<br/>No hard disables, needs to be relatively close to enemies in order to contribute to fights.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Undying can be played in many ways: if you are going for a more supportive role, use your Tombstone and your Flesh Golem to slow the enemies while spamming Decay, then let your lane partner get the kill. Otherwise, use Soul Rip to finish a Hero while there are many creeps nearby: this way it deals more damage.<br/>While initiating, use Tombstone and Flesh Golem, then Decay/Soul Rip: this way these abilities deal more damage.<br/>Though his spells are individually quite cheap, you almost always have mana problems since both Soul Rip and especially Decay are very spammable. Consider getting Arcane Boots during the laning phase, then disassembling it once you have enough to buy the remaining pieces of a Bloodstone. You can then convert your standard boots to Phase Boots allowing you the mobility and chase power to keep Flesh Golem's powerful aura on the right targets during a teamfight.<br/>Another good item for Undying in the early game is Soul Ring. After using Soul Ring, you can cast decay for free. If you hit 2 or more heroes with this spell, you make up for the HP cost for Soul Ring.<br/>If you do not have enough gold to buy a Bloodstone in time or you would prefer cheaper items, try to make yourself as tanky as possible: if you are initiating, enemies target you first. That is why you need an early Vanguard and/or a Hood of Defiance if the opposing team has a lot of nukers. Other useful items that increase your HP are Rod of Atos, which solves most of your mana problems too, and Heart of Tarrasque.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Decay</h4>Decay is very useful even if left at level 1. Max it when team battles begin to start: you can spam it even more and make enemies squishier.<br/>Be aware and take note of your mana consumption, however. With it's incredibly low cooldown and rather high mana cost, it's very easy to end up in a situation where you are unable to cast your other spells or item abilities.<h4>Soul Rip</h4> Do not use Soul Rip to harass, but use it to heal a friendly hero or to finish off enemies. This is more effective if there are many units nearby, such as creeps if you are laning, or heroes if you are initiating.
<br/>Tombstone is often a great way to maximise the damage/healing potential of Soul Rip, especially when the creep waves from both factions have just begun to engage in battle.<br/>Soul Rip works very well with heroes that can summon additional creeps or create illusions, such as with Broodmother's spiderlings or Phantom Lancer's illusions. The mass amounts of summons and illusions can easily bring your Soul Rip to maximum effect, making such heroes powerful partners to gank with.<br/>When using Soul Rip to damage an opponent, remember to use Decay before. Since Soul Rip deals a static amount of damage, it will deal more if the enemy's maximum health is reduced before rather than after.<h4>Tombstone</h4>If a ward spot is nearby at the outset of a fight, remember that you can cast your Tombstone on top of it, making it invisible to enemy heroes (unless they have a ward up there). You can also use the Tombstone as a temporary ward anywhere thanks to its long duration, but this is not usually advised as it has a lengthy cooldown.<br/>Attacks from illusions will count as hero attacks for the purposes of destroying the Tombstone. Keep that in mind when placing the Tombstone if the enemy team has heroes like Phantom Lancer or Naga Siren.<br/>If Naga Siren is on your team, be aware that Tombstone summons zombies even when the enemy targets are sleeping and untargetable. This can be used to your advantage.<br/>Should the enemy team have an Earthshaker, it is unwise to place a tombstone at the beginning of a teamfight. Each zombie causes the echo to deal extra damage, likely obliterating your entire team (or at the very least severely injuring them).<br/>Zombies are spell immune and require a certain amount of attacks to kill. Therefore they are unaffected by most AoE spells but take full damage from multishot-type abilities. Be aware of heroes with these abilities that can easily deal with your Tombstone zombies, such as Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon.<h4>Flesh Golem</h4> Flesh Golem increases the damage done to and slows down any nearby enemies, and it should be cast early in order to maximise its effect to the fullest.
<br/>The damage amplification and slow are affected by the distance between Undying and his enemies, being greater the closer he is to them. As such, you would need to be in the thick of it to ensure that the effect are at its greatest.<br/>Flesh Golem heals Undying for his own maximum health by 2% per non-Hero units and 6% per Hero. Building up HP-items would thus greatly increase his survivability and allow him to make use of the healing to its fullest effect.<br/>Do not be afraid to activate Flesh Golem in order to escape, as the slow effect, coupled with Undying's relatively high natural movement speed, may be just enough to outrun a number of melee heroes.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Wraith King is a durable carry with a reliable stun. As his ultimate, Reincarnation, effectively doubles his health in a teamfight, he is commonly built as a tank carry. He is traditionally popular among new players for his survivability and potentially simple playstyle. However, Wraith King can also be played at a high level of skill, particularly by using active items.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great durability<br/>High Survivability<br/>Reliable Stun<br/>Rather easy to learn<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana pool<br/>Slow attack speed and movement speed<br/>Low armor in early to mid game<br/>Mostly countered by heroes who can mana burn<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3> Due to Wraith King's sustainability, he usually should initiate fights and tank up some damage first. Sometimes, it is great to even die first, triggering  which heavily slows every nearby enemy. At this point, the enemies usually either prepare to take him down again, or try to escape when they can't take him down a second time. This is the perfect opportunity for Wraith King's team to follow up and catch the enemies off-guard.
<br/>Besides these, dying as last as Wraith King basically just wastes his Reincarnation, since he cannot do much on his own after respawning besides dying a second time right away.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Wraithfire Blast</h4>Wraithfire Blast} is a decent nuke early on, which also allows Ostarion to disable and slow at the same time. A perfect tool for ganks and team fights, it has a relatively low cooldown, but its relatively high mana cost does not allow it to be used frequently. It should be saved for when it is really needed.<br/>It is generally best to have Wraithfire Blast maxed first as both of Ostarion's passives are not very effective in the laning stage, since both are based on attack damage.<h4>Vampiric Aura</h4>Having Vampiric Aura active during the laning phase shifts the creeps equilibrium, since it also affects the allied lane creeps, forcing Wraith King to farm and fight closer to the enemy tower, which makes him more susceptible to enemy ganks in the early game. If no early pushes are planned, it should be toggled off until after the laning phase.<br/>Vampiric Aura's life-stealing particles are hidden from the enemy so long as they do not have vision of Wraith King, so there isn't a need to toggle it off when jungling or ambushing to mask Wraith King's location.<h4>Mortal Strike</h4>Unlike other sources of critical strike, Mortal Strike deals more damage against non-Hero units than against Heroes. If Wraith King has a source of cleave (e.g. Magnus' Empower or a Battle Fury), he is potentially able to deal even more damage to Heroes indirectly through the splash damage than by actually attacking them head-on, especially if the enemy Heroes are under Armor-enhancing buffs.<h4>Reincarnation</h4> Reincarnation has quite a high mana cost for a Wraith King's rather low mana pool and regeneration. It is best to always keep his mana pool high enough for Reincarnation to trigger, or to make sure that enough charges of his  are present in case of an emergency.
<br/>Another possible solution to this problem is to have a Soul Ring, since it grants enough mana to sustain Reincarnation's mana cost when already having at least some left-over mana, unless the enemies have mana burning capabilities. The health loss from Soul Ring's active ability is usually not a problem thanks to Vampiric Aura.<br/> It is generally beneficial for Wraith King to die first during a gank, as the slow only activates upon his death, which will greatly benefit his other team members. This prevents the enemies from effectively escaping or attacking back, allowing Wraith King's allies to pick off their targets with ease.
<br/>Additionally, if Wraith King is the last to die, the benefit of the slow is greatly reduced, as there would be no allies around to make the most of the slow.<br/>The Aghanim's Scepter bonus works even while Wraith King is reincarnating himself. Allies will still enter Wraith form so long as they are within range of Wraith King when they perish.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Anti-Mage is one of the most mobile carries in the game, mostly well known for his ability to punish lineups heavily reliant on magic damage with Spell Shield giving him very high magic resistance and his Mana Void can be used to cause massive damage to heroes with huge mana pools. His Blink makes him one of the fastest farmers in the game, with the ability to jump from creep camp to creep camp and quickly clear them with few items. Anti-Mage is however incredibly reliant on items to unlock his true potential, having a very low strength gain and no way of locking down enemy heroes makes him a very vulnerable hero if he does not have enough farm.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely mobile and hard to catch.<br/>High attack speed.<br/>Scales well into late game.<br/>Punishes heroes who rely on mana.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low Strength and Intelligence gain.<br/>Reliant on Battle Fury to farm<br/>Very reliant on farm to scale.<br/>Needs a decent support in lane to get good farm.<br/>Can be shut down in the early game.<br/>Weak against gankers that disable if overextended.<br/>Countered by heroes who aren't 100% dependent to mana, such as Huskar<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>You are utterly useless in team fights if you can't physically attack enemies. There are many ways to counter raw physical damage in DotA, especially if it's melee. Decent players will buy items like Scythe of Vyse, Blade Mail and Ghost Scepter to shut you down. Timing your entrance into the battle is everything for you.<br/>Do not pick Anti-Mage if your team picks farmers such as Shadow Fiend, Enigma, or Tinker.<br/>If you find yourself being killed quickly a Vitality Booster provides 250 health and can be later built into a Heart of Tarrasque. Generally, it is advisable to get a faster Manta Style.<br/>A quick Battle Fury will greatly increase your farming ability which will greatly help later in the game.<br/>Don't only farm the jungle. If the enemy is pushing Anti-Mage can push a different lane solo with a reliable escape mechanism with Blink and Town Portal Scroll and can indirectly defend by forcing the enemy to defend. It will require at least 1 core to respond to kill you generally giving your team a huge advantage if you TP back home to fight.<br/>Be very wary of heroes like Shadow Demon, Dark Seer and Morphling, as illusions created from you carry the Mana Break spell as well, and combined with Anti-Mage's high Agility, could easily turn the tides of a teamfight.<br/>Once you get full slotted you could opt to sell your Battle Fury for a different item, but its creep clearing abilities are still very useful and sometimes critical. You should sell it if you absolutely need another item that can turn the tides, such as a Monkey King Bar.<br/>Many players are tempted to switch Power Treads to agility, but given your low strength gain (1.2), it may be better to keep them on strength if you are not jungling.<br/>If under a lot of harass in lane, it can be worth it to get a Ring of Regeneration on top of your Ring of Health and later use that to build a Vladmir's Offering. Vlad's allows Anti-Mage to solo Roshan and also farm at full health while also being able to jungle ancients efficiently.<br/>It can be a good idea to finish a hero with your ultimate, even if you could easily kill with an autoattack. Chances are a hero you focused is running low on mana and its team trying to save would come in close enough for your ultimate to hit quite a few enemies.<br/>Even with Black King Bar, you should avoid being an initiator and instead bide your time until you can exploit a weak spot in the enemy's formation after a team fight starts, usually in the back lines where the supports are. This is especially important if the enemy carry is on the front lines with a BKB, which is a fight you will almost never win head on.<br/>Even though you have poor strength gain, your starting strength and armor is actually very decent. Couple that with your naturally fast attack speed and a single point in mana break makes you very strong in trading hits.<br/>With the above tip in mind against some common offlane heroes like Windranger and Mirana who try to harass you it's a good idea to constantly blink on them to trade hits as early as you're level 2, rather than simply withstanding harass. Setting the pace for the laning is critical to how fast you farm later in the game.<br/>Your laning phase is an absolute nightmare. Many heroes can cripple your early game by harassing you and chasing you away. Also, if you don't utilize your laning phase the game may well end before you reach Anti-Mage's maximum potential. Ask your teammates to babysit you.<br/>Anti-Mage has relatively low base health. If you can't kill an enemy quickly, it may be best to disengage, as an unfavorable fight can easily result in your own death.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Mana Break</h4> Mana Break is most effective against heroes with low mana pools, as you can completely deplete and disable them in less time. However, this also means that Mana Void will do significantly less damage when deployed as its damage is reliant on the mana pool's maximum size.
<br/>Take note that heroes with small mana pool also potentially take much less damage from Mana Break since they are emptied so quickly, preventing the mana burn from further contributing to the Anti-Mage's potential damage.<br/>Manta Style is a commonly built item on Anti-Mage as your illusions can also apply Mana Break, tripling the ability's effectiveness. It also provides an increase to all attributes and a means to remove most disables, especially silences, that could prevent escaping via blink.<br/>The damage from Mana Break is dealt as physical damage. As such, deliberately reducing your opponent's armour will increase the damage that Mana Break does.<br/>Unlike most passive attack modifiers, Mana Break does not bypass spell immunity.<h4>Blink</h4>Blink is the most common choice for your first ability point, as its immediate benefit is better than either of your passives. Put some points into Spell Shield if you are facing strong opponents or go for Mana Break if you want to be aggressive.<br/>Never use Blink to start a fight unless you know you can win it. Doing so could leave you stranded in a bad situation.<br/>Blink is a very versatile and powerful mobility tool. You can also use it to chase, maneuver, or to avoid spells during battles.<br/>Relative to Anti-Mage's mana pool, Blink is somewhat costly in terms of mana. As such, you should refrain from freely employing the spell in the early stages of the game unless you have intelligence and mana boosting items to supplement your low base intelligence.<h4>Spell Shield</h4> While Spell Shield provides substantial magic resistance, it is not a substitute for magic immunity as it does not block non-damage effects of enemy magic.
<br/>Additionally, spells and abilities that deals physical and pure damage will completely bypass the bonus bestowed by Spell Shield<br/> Against an enemy lineup that consist of almost entirely physical damage dealers, Spell Shield can be considered as redundant and should be levelled up last in such a situation.
<br/>Likewise, if you're against a spell and nuke heavy opposition, you may need to spend some early points in Spell Shield to negate and reduce some of the potential spell damage.<h4>Mana Void</h4>Mana Void is very difficult to use to full effect. Constantly check enemies with large mana pools. Use it on enemy casters after they have used their abilities and burned most of their mana. It can absolutely devastate an enemy team if used properly. Note that it does have a short stun, allowing you to cancel spell casts and channels.<br/>Mana Void partially bypasses spell immunity as the damage is dealt in an area even if the primary target becomes spell immune, so while the main target will not take any damage, enemies around the radius will take full damage from the spell based on the mana loss of the primary target.<br/>Mana Void will apply a mini-stun to the main target that pierces spell immunity. This can be used to disrupt channeling spells and abilities.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Arc Warden is a carry that can nuke enemies early and then split push to end the game. His health, armor, and mana early on are fairly low, but they still give him enough to last in lane and nuke foes with his combo. His health and mana grow to respectable degrees later on, but his agility still suffers. His biggest detriments throughout the game are no mobility skills, needing to micromanage, and his abilities suffering vs multiple heroes. Nonetheless, a Warden who gets farmed is a foe to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Highest base strength and Intelligence of all agility heroes, and highest Intelligence growth.<br/>Can easily nuke most enemies 1v1<br/>Split Pushes extremely well with Tempest Double<br/>One of the most versatile heroes in the game<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Second lowest base agility and agility gain of all agility heroes<br/>0.1 base armor makes him susceptible to physical harassment early on.<br/>Slow movement speed with no mobility skills makes it hard for him to escape if ganked.<br/>Needs items to farm quickly, no ability outside of his ult helps him with farming.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Arc Warden is squishy early on with no escape tools. Pair him with a support if Safe Lane, or if heading mid make sure to keep wards up so you can see incoming ganks and know when it's time to fall back<br/>Warden's abilities are strongest in a 1v1 situation. As such, placing him mid can see him easily dominate most other heroes there and gain a gold advantage.<br/>Never skip Hand of Midas. Warden needs it to farm as he has no way to farm in his abilities, but he absolutely needs items. He also gains the hugest benefit out of it because his Tempest Double can use Midas with the gold and XP going to the main Warden.<br/>Consumables like Healing Salve, Enchanted Mango, Clarity and Bottle cannot be copied by the Tempest Double.<br/>Arc Warden can have potentially unlimited uses of Items with charges such as Drum of Endurance and Diffusal Blade if at least 1 charge is kept on the main Arc Warden, then only used on the Tempest Double, However, Black King Bar charges are used on both Arc Warden and his Tempest Double.<br/> Items that place buffs or debuffs can have their duration doubled if timed right, as well as perhaps correcting any mistakes the main Arc Warden has made (such as targeting the wrong unit).
<br/>Items that place buffs on allies, such as Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb, can be used on the main Arc Warden for increased protection and then using the main one's own to their allies, or vice versa.<br/>The Double can use teleport items such as Town Portal Scroll or Boots of Travel. This means while the main Arc Warden is somewhere else, farming, pushing or defending, the Double can be on the opposite side of the map contributing to a gank or farm the enemy jungle easily.<br/> Using  with the Double grants the player the gold and 2.5x experience. The Double maintains the cooldown while it is unsummoned. This means that the double will not be able to use the item with every summon and Arc Warden must time the Double's summon to get the full benefits of the extra Midas.
<br/>One Hand of Midas on the hero results in (190/100*60=)114 gold per minute if used whenever it is off cooldown. For the Tempest Double, the gold per minute is (190/100*60=) 114 gold per minute, resulting in 228 gold per minute for the player when both are always used when off cooldown, 2 times more than other heroes with one purchased Midas.<br/>It is wise to use the Double to farm or stack neutral camps if it has nothing else to do with its remaining duration for more efficiency and to gain more gold and experience.<br/>It is very important to not allow an enemy Rubick to steal Tempest Double, since the ability fully works for Rubick. As Tempest Double is the only ability which the doubles have already on cooldown when summoned, this means Spell Steal is completely available to use for a Rubick Double, fully able to steal and cast a spell as the same way the original Rubick. Wisely managed and well timed, Rubick and its doubles can steal and cast important ultimates such as Black Hole or Reverse Polarity with ease.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Flux</h4>The ability only slows and damages if there's no enemy heroes, creeps, or jungle creeps within 225 range. However, if cast on an enemy near a tower or ward, they are still slowed and damaged.<br/>Upon casting, the enemy always takes one damage instance, no matter if they're near another hero.<br/>It deals damage every 0.5 seconds, resulting in 13 total damage ticks overall.<br/>Applying Flux on an enemy first before summoning a Spark Wraith can make hitting the enemy with it easier.<h4>Magnetic Field fully affects buildings, so it can and should be used to deter a push. Keep in mind that True Strike does not work against buildings, so even if the enemy obtains a Monkey King Bar, towers would still be fully protected with this spell.</h4>Spark Wraith<br/>[edit | edit source]<h4>Spark Wraith gives 300 vision at its area. Thus, it can be used as a pseudo ward for scouting for possible ganks.</h4>Tempest Double<br/>[edit | edit source]<h4>The Tempest Double essentially acts like an advanced version of an illusion. The main differences are: Tempest Double uses the current stats of Arc Warden, benefits from both stats and things like Point Booster that just add flat amounts. Only takes 100% damage as well. Deals 100% of Arc Warden's current damage including damage from items such as Daedalus, and gains the attack speed from items like Mjollnir. It also gains the passive attack speed from Moon Shard Can use abilities and items. They have their own, separate cooldowns on the Double. A few items, however, are not 100% usable by the Double. These include: Refresher Orb is always on cooldown for the Double Bloodstone does not apply the heal when the Double dies. Observer and Sentry Wards are not placeable by the Double. Divine Rapier isn't copied to the Double at all. Helm of the Dominator is usable by the Double. However, any units dominated by the Double are lost when it's resummoned. Consumables such as Healing Salves, Clarity, Enchanted Mango, Tango, Tango (Shared), and Bottle are not copied to the Tempest Double at all.</h4>Items<br/>[edit | edit source]<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bloodseeker is a snowballing carry who grows faster and stronger as his enemies get weaker. Like a shark in water, Bloodseeker detects injured enemies across the entire map and runs them down with unnatural speed through Thirst. His Rupture makes enemies bleed with every step, allowing him to gank targets with ease during the early game. Regaining health each time an enemy falls, Bloodseeker overwhelms enemy teams in fights, leaving little chance for turnarounds. However, Bloodseeker has no disables of his own, and must rely on his teammates to lock down targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Fast movement speed.<br/>Regains health by killing enemies.<br/>Good early ganker.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no disables.<br/>Vulnerable to enemy disables.<br/>Countered by tanks.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Bloodseeker should attempt to reach level six as soon as possible so he can start ganking with Rupture.<br/>Because of the damage and speed bonus from Thirst, Bloodseeker players should always keep an eye on the enemy team's overall health, no matter where they are.
<br/>An enemy team with low health means Bloodseeker has a significant advantage.<br/>Bloodseeker wins games by being aggressive and maintaining a kill advantage over the enemy team. Do not try to passively outfarm harder carries like Medusa or Spectre.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Bloodrage</h4>In lane, Bloodrage is especially good to use when your creeps have come under tower, not only making it easier to last hit but also replenishing your health.<br/>Use Bloodrage on Bloodseeker to take down buildings quickly.<br/>Use Bloodrage on an enemy with low damage, such as a tank or support, to help your team kill them quickly.<br/>Use Bloodrage on an ally with AoE nuke abilities to greatly improve their damage output, and thereby increasing your bonus from Thirst.<br/>Be careful when using Bloodrage on Bloodseeker when he is outnumbered, as the increased damage received can kill him very quickly.<br/>If Bloodseeker is near death in a teamfight, kill low health enemies/creeps in order to replenish his health before returning to fight tougher enemies.<br/>Use Bloodrage on enemies that are fleeing from a fight, this can make you and your team's chase more effective.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Blood Rite</h4>Use Blood Rite before closing in to attack. The silence will prevent enemies from disabling Bloodseeker.<br/>Use Blood Rite when retreating to prevent enemies from disabling Bloodseeker and his allies. The damage done to enemies will also help him move faster.<br/>Use Blood Rite after using Rupture to disable the target's abilities and prevent escape.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Thirst</h4>During the laning phase, put at least one point in Thirst to remove the movement speed cap and to receive bonus damage.<br/>Thirst is usually maxed first because it helps Bloodseeker farm during the early game.<br/>Attacking the enemy will cause subsequent attacks to hit harder, and damage dealt in other lanes will provide a further boost to your attack damage.<br/>Each individual Meepo will add to the Thirst bonus stack.<br/> Since Thirst reveals low HP heroes on the map, allies with global abilities, such as  or  will have a chance to finish them off.
<br/>Ping the minimap to alert your team if you spot an enemy at low health. This is particularly effective in the early game against junglers, who rely on the safety of the trees to farm until their health is very low.<br/>Situationally, it can be good to leave low health enemies in a team fight that is in your team's favor in order to chase down more healthy enemies.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Rupture</h4>When ganking, it is sometimes best to save Rupture for when your target begins running away rather than using it to initiate the gank, as it will take no damage while standing still and fighting you.<br/>Rupture deals pure damage, meaning it pierces spell immunity. Because of this, do not hesitate to use it enemy carries even if they have Black King Bar.<br/>Rupture can be used with Force Staff to deal more damage.<br/>Rupture works on most blinking heroes (a Queen of Pain could blink far enough to avoid taking damage).<br/> Rupture is one of the best abilities for intercepting an enemy hero that is chasing you or your allies. 
<br/>Heroes with high mobility such as Anti-Mage, Lycan, Queen of Pain or Night Stalker suffer devastating damage when Ruptured.<br/> Some heroes have movement abilities that renders them , and therefore do not trigger Rupture's HP loss. Using Rupture on these heroes can be wasteful.
<br/>Storm Spirit with Ball Lightning<br/>Faceless Void with Time Walk<br/>Morphling with Waveform<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bounty Hunter is a strong utility support hero who helps his team by picking off the enemy one by one, increasing gold gain for his team and giving them opportunities to take map objectives while they outnumber the enemy. However, he is also very vulnerable since his low strength means that he can be easily killed if the enemy catches him while he approaches a target, particularly due to his reliance on Shadow Walk. As such, good judgment and map awareness are key when playing Bounty Hunter, as he must be able to successfully initiate on and kill his targets without the enemy retaliating.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage.<br/>Invisibility.<br/>Can counter other invisible heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very squishy.<br/>Mana-dependent.<br/>Weak team fight presence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One small advantage that Bounty Hunter possesses over other heroes is that he has 1000 night vision instead of the standard 800. This makes Bounty Hunter a powerful night hunter, as he can spot targets at night who cannot see him, and cast Track on them from the Fog of War.<br/>In general, it is wise to check the enemy's inventory any time they appear on the map, and be aware of all enemy players' positions on the map. Knowing if the enemy may place Sentry Wards to give warning of your approach, as well as if they have Dust of Appearance or Gem of True Sight, can save your life as you can prevent yourself from walking into a trap. Additionally, knowing that certain enemies are on another part of the map will allow you to kill your target in the knowledge that their allies cannot reach them in time.<br/>When playing Bounty Hunter, it is important to stay off the map as much as possible once the laning stage ends. Keep the enemy guessing on where you are, so that they second-guess their decision to farm their own jungle, or push a lane too far forward, or go to any part of the map by themselves, for fear of being found and killed by you and your teammates. By doing so, you can destroy the enemy's economy as they will be too preoccupied worrying about you and not be spending time farming, giving your team space to out-farm them and get a strong gold and level advantage.<br/>Bounty Hunter is best played as an off-laner or roamer.<br/>As an off-laner, Bounty Hunter should attempt to block the enemy's pull camp so that he can get last-hits closer to his tower, and use Shadow Walk to sap experience if needed. As well, using an Observer Ward to block the enemy's pull camp can, depending on the ward's specific location, alert you to any incoming rotations by the enemy's supports, or let you see if the enemy is ferrying detection items to themselves with their courier in order to counter Shadow Walk.<br/>As a roamer, Bounty Hunter should generally focus on helping out in ganks by using Shadow Walk to approach an enemy who gets out of position during laning, adding his damage output to gank attempts. While he lacks contribution besides his right-clicks and body-blocking at level 1, once he has a level or two he can add his skills to the mix.<br/>Early play with Bounty Hunter can allow him to snipe the enemy's courier from invisibility, under optimal circumstances. As he can wait for the enemy's courier invisibly with Shadow Walk, he can choose to kill it as it approaches the enemy's mid to deliver their Bottle, or snipe it as it tries to ferry detection items to their safe lane supports. However, it requires good game sense and map awareness to know where the courier might appear, so this tactic is only viable at higher levels of gameplay.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shuriken Toss</h4> Shuriken Toss is a ranged damage nuke that mini-stuns its target upon impact. It will also bounce between enemies that have been affected by Track.
<br/>As it is Bounty Hunter's only ranged nuke, maxing Shuriken Toss as his first spell increases his nuking power and allows him to more easily finish off enemies during ganks. The nuking power is strongest in the early game when HP pools are small and all heroes are more vulnerable to magic nukes.<br/>Remember that Shuriken Toss mini-stuns the target upon impact, so it is better to hold it in reserve until the enemy uses a channeling spell or activates their Town Portal Scroll. While it does have a short cooldown, the channeling time on a Town Portal Scroll is even shorter.<br/>When using Shuriken Toss alongside Track to inflict damage to multiple enemy heroes in a teamfight, remember that the initial target does not have to be affected by Track in order for it to bounce. This allows Bounty Hunter to throw the shuriken at an un-Tracked target and it will bounce to any Tracked heroes within range. Using this tactic can be useful for increasing your damage output if you do not have time to cast Track on all enemy heroes before using the shuriken, or for increasing the shuriken's maximum range to 1600 by tossing it at a creep and closing the remainder of the distance from the bounce.<br/>Be careful about approaching targets to cast Shuriken Toss on them, as its short cast range may put you in unnecessary danger. If possible, try to Track the target first, and use a nearby creep as a target to bounce the shuriken from a safer range. Remember that you can also use the bounce to catch a fleeing enemy hero who would otherwise be outside of its 400 cast range.<h4>Jinada</h4> Jinada is a powerful damage ability that gives Bounty Hunter the ability to inflict critical strikes at will.
<br/>Due to its scaling, Jinada is best to max out last among Bounty Hunter's skills, as its damage output is minimal in the early game before Bounty Hunter has enough gold to purchase damage items to boost its power. However, it is also wise to take a single value point in the laning stage due to the slow it inflicts on its target.<br/>Because Jinada's crit is guaranteed every time it is off cooldown but cannot proc otherwise, its effectiveness increases with more damage but not attack speed. Bounty Hunter is best served building raw damage items, as attack speed does not help Jinada to proc more frequently.<br/>Jinada's slow is a powerful disabling ability, particularly when combined with the guaranteed critical strike and augmented with the surprise of Shadow Walk. Using both abilities in tandem during a gank can deal a large amount of damage to a target and then slow them for allies to close in.<br/>When going for the level 25 Talent that reduces Jinada's cooldown to 1 second, with the right amount of Attack Speed a crit every two hits is guaranteed. The total Attack speed value where this stops working (and you get a crit only every 3 hits) lies approximately around 270.<h4>Shadow Walk</h4> Shadow Walk is an invisibility spell that renders Bounty Hunter invisible until he attacks, casts a spell, uses an item or the duration expires.
<br/>Shadow Walk is Bounty Hunter's go-to spell for mobility, escape and initiations, and as such it should generally be leveled first. At level 1, it provides 20 seconds of invisibility on a 15 second cooldown, allowing Bounty Hunter to remain invisible so long as he as the mana to back it up.<br/>As Shadow Walk applies the bonus damage buff right at the start of the spell, it is possible to attack a target during the fade time and still inflict the bonus damage while retaining the buff. This can help with last hitting or harassing as you will be able to use the bonus damage twice (once during the fade time and once when breaking invisibility), however it becomes less feasible as the spell is leveled due to the fade time shortening.<br/>Shadow Walk has an instant cast time, and does not interrupt channeling. As such, it can be cast without breaking your stride while escaping, and can be activated after beginning to channel a Town Portal Scroll, whether the aim is to become invisible while escaping or to become invisible prior to reaching your destination.<br/>Be wary that using items will break Shadow Walk. Therefore, actions such as changing attributes on Power Treads or activating the movement speed boost of Phase Boots will break invisibility, so be extremely careful about item usage while under the effects of Shadow Walk. Conversely though, if you have been affected by Dust of Appearance you can instantly break invisibility using the above two methods in order to negate the slow that it inflicts on invisible heroes.<br/>Keep in mind, Shadow Walk's duration is always longer than its cooldown. At higher levels, it is possible to strike a target out of invisibility, become invisible again immediately afterward, and then hit them again for large amounts of bonus damage. However, this also leaves Bounty Hunter vulnerable since he will be visible and with Shadow Walk on cooldown, making escaping difficult if the enemy finds him before he can turn invisible again.<h4>Track</h4> Track is a powerful intelligence spell in any situation, and is a great boon to any team. As it provides True Sight on the target, as well as increasing the movement speed of all nearby allies, it is extremely powerful in preventing the enemy from easily initiating and giving them a mobility advantage during teamfights.
<br/>Track is an extremely powerful ability against heroes that rely on invisibility to escape, as the True Sight reveals their location through invisibility. It is also very powerful against heroes with blink abilities, as they often rely not only on quickly putting distance between themselves and their pursuers, but also on jumping in an unknown direction to make their opponents guess.<br/>While Bounty Hunter excels at killing lone targets by himself, his team is better served in assisting him whenever he ganks targets. This not only increases the chances of a successful kill, but awards bonus reliable gold to nearby allies. The allied bonus gold exists for a reason, and rewards a team that coordinates kills with Bounty Hunter rather than letting him try to kill enemies by himself.<br/>In a teamfight, try to cast Track on as many enemies as possible first, as it will give all teammates a movement speed advantage and mark them all as potential targets for a bounced Shuriken Toss. Any successful kills will greatly increase the gold bounty received, which can lead to buying more core items faster. However, when ganking a solo target, it is generally advisable to reserve Track until after you initiate on the target with a Shadow Walk and Jinada combo, in order to avoid alerting them until the last possible second.<br/>In general, it is wise to Track as many enemy heroes as possible in order to gather intelligence on their locations and movement. This gives your team a powerful strategic advantage since they will not only know the location of the Tracked targets and benefit from the movement speed bonus over a wider area, but may also give warning of other enemies casting certain spells (such as Moonlight Shadow).<br/>Keep in mind, Track allows you to discern how much gold the target has, which lets you know how close they may be to getting one of their core items. After tracking an enemy (especially one of their core heroes), be sure to alert teammates to the debuff (Alt + left click on the debuff in the enemy player's status bar). This also serves to log the event in the chat log for later reference. This allows your team to make the decision based on the amount of farm the enemy has: if they are close to getting another major item, quickly rotating and ganking the target can set them back tremendously, however if they are farming poorly you can choose to engage a different enemy or take the time to continue farming on your side.<br/>Since Track has such a low cooldown, it is a very good ability to use in order to break an enemy's Linken's Sphere, whether in a teamfight or during a gank. In teamfights, it can render their Linken's Sphere useless ahead of time, and in ganks it can be used as a leader prior to a stronger targeted disable.<br/>It is important to note that if Bounty Hunter is in the enemy's Fog of War and casts Track on an enemy, his position is not revealed to them, thereby allowing him to stealthily mark targets for his team. However, the debuff status indicator still appears in enemy players' HUDs, and the movement speed bonus is easily visible on all nearby creeps. Regardless, it is a useful feature in that it allows Bounty Hunter to Track targets without revealing his location.<br/> Given his role, Bounty Hunter has a myriad of items he can build to assist in getting kills against targets.
<br/>As an off-laner, it is wise to request your team's supports to buy you an Observer Ward to give you vision in the enemy's jungle and possibly block their pull camp (although do not be afraid to buy one for yourself if you must move immediately to lane upon connecting to battle). Doing so will alert you to any incoming rotations and ganks so that you can keep alive. Once past the laning stage you are encouraged to regularly buy Observer Wards yourself, as you can traverse the map with Shadow Walk and place them for your team, giving you map vision to spot potential ganks.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Broodmother is hero made to pressure the lanes early. While she excels at split-pushing the lanes and taking towers with her army of spiderlings, she cannot carry the game by herself and normally needs to coordinate with her team to finish the game in a timely manner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong split-pusher.<br/>Very strong kill potential early game.<br/>Can farm enemy jungle.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Predictable play style due to lack of global presence.<br/>Damage scales off late game.<br/>Often forces own team to play 4 vs 5.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Broodmother is usually played alone in the offlane, as the invisibility and regeneration from her webs allow her to face off against multiple opponents.<br/>Broodmother is arguably the best early lane pusher in the game. A good player must take advantage of this.<br/>An aggressive Broodmother can often take down a tier two tower while other players are still farming.<br/>Beware of enemy Sentry Wards in lane. It is often worth it to buy your own Sentry Wards to detect and destroy the enemy wards.<br/>Remember that you can use Tangos, or a Quelling Blade to take out Sentry Wards quickly.<br/>Broodmother is very effective against solitary targets, but against multiple enemies she suffers; as her lifesteal can generally only replenish the damage taken from a solitary foe.<br/>Broodmother's primary escape mechanism is to move into her webs onto impassable terrain when attacked.<br/>Although Broodmother is usually pushing lanes alone, she is still sometimes needed in teamfights. It is important when playing her to know the right time to push, and when to team fight.<br/>Though Broodmother excels in the hard lane, she can also control and farm parts of the enemy jungle.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Spawn Spiderlings</h4>A Soul Ring is usually needed to use Spawn Spiderlings frequently.<br/>Spawn spiderlings acts as a ranged nuke, and is very useful for killing weak enemies that are fleeing.<br/>As a group, spiderlings deal a surprising amount of damage, especially in the early game. Use them to harass opponents in lane.<br/>Send out spiderlings to scout, block creep camps, and keep an eye on Roshan.<br/>Even though spiderlings give little gold, constantly feeding groups of them will benefit the enemy team.<br/>Spiderlings can spawn Spiderites by denying allied creeps.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Spin Web</h4>Use Spin Web on top of an enemy tower before diving in on weak heroes. The regeneration and move speed bonus combined with Broodmother's slow is very effective for diving on heroes with no reliable escape or stun.<br/>Use Spin Web over trees and high ground to give Broodmother escape paths.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Incapacitating Bite</h4>Incapacitating Bite is not a unique attack modifier and stacks fully with Orb of Venom and Eye of Skadi and also with Poison Sting making it almost impossible for your enemies to escape on foot.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Insatiable Hunger</h4>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Clinkz is a great all around ranged carry with high offensive burst damage. Though frail and easy to kill, Skeleton Walk grants Clinkz stealth and haste to escape and re-position himself. This skill is also what makes Clinkz such an incredible ganker. His Searing Arrows provide huge bonus damage, greatly injuring enemies in conjunction with Strafe. Despite his high damage, Clinkz has no disabling abilities, and has difficulty killing enemies once they move out of range.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Invisible ganker.<br/>Very high attack damage.<br/>Destroys buildings quickly.<br/>High movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very fragile.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Slow attack animation.<br/>Easily countered by true sight.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Clinkz has one of the slowest attack animations in the game. Time his attacks carefully to get last hits.<br/>Clinkz relies on successful early to mid game ganks to be effective.<br/>The simplest way to gank is to go invisible with Skeleton Walk, position Clinkz behind an enemy, then activate Strafe before attacking to land as many arrows as possible.
<br/>This is made easier with an Orchid Malevolence, which prevents enemies from using a disable or escape ability.<br/>Enemies farming in the jungle are prime targets for Clinkz to gank with this tactic.<br/>The worst case scenario is for the target to simple move out of range before Clinkz lands enough arrows. Position Clinkz close to the target or wait until the target is distracted before breaking invisibility.<br/>While he can be an excellent ganker, Clinkz is extremely fragile and puts out huge amounts of DPS, making him a priority target in teamfights. Try to let teammates initiate while you dance around the edge of the fight dealing damage to distracted or disabled opponents.<br/>If you are focusing on early game ganking, level Strafe as your second ability to max as the decreased cooldown makes you a great threat.<br/>If you are playing as the team's late game carry, maxing Skeleton Walk keeps Clinkz safe and able to move quickly into untaken lanes and the jungle to farm.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Strafe</h4>Strafe's attack speed bonus is constant at all levels, so one point is enough for the early game.<br/>Strafe's short duration and long cooldown during the early game means it should be used very carefully.<br/>Combined with Searing Arrows, Strafe can deplete Clinkz's mana very quickly during the early game. Make sure to retain enough for Skeleton Walk in case you need to escape from failed gank attempts.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Searing Arrows</h4>Searing Arrows is usually leveled first because its high damage helps Clinkz score last hits.<br/>During the early game, a few Searing Arrows will do enough damage to harass opponents out of lane. Cast it manually () to avoid drawing aggro.
<br/>However, Clinkz should still prioritize on getting last hits for himself.<br/>Searing Arrows can be quite mana intensive in the early game. An Orchid Malevolence is usually purchased to offset its mana needs.<br/>Searing Arrow's high damage will take down buildings very quickly. Coupled with Skeleton Walk, it allows Clinkz to push lanes efficiently.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Skeleton Walk</h4>Use Skeleton Walk a good amount of time before you expect to ambush an enemy, or appear in a fight. This triggers the cooldown early, therefore allowing you it again soon after, either for a quick escape or to chase down any survivors.<br/>Use Skeleton Walk before crossing commonly warded spots, such as the river, to avoid being seen coming.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Death Pact</h4> Death Pact's bonuses depends on the creep it sacrifices. The higher the creep's health, the higher the bonuses Clinkz gains. 
<br/>Always try to use Death Pact on the biggest creep possible, such as the Satyr Tormenter and Centaur Conqueror.<br/>Devouring one of these creeps gives Clinkz 550/715/880 bonus health as well as 55/71.5/88 bonus base damage.<br/>Siege creeps are also acceptable if there is no time to enter the jungle.<br/>In the late game, Clinkz could devour Mega Melee Creeps that have (static) 1270 HP, thus giving him 635/825.5/1016 bonus health and 63.5/82.6/101.6 bonus base damage.<br/>Use Death Pact before an impending fight to make sure Clinkz has enough durability and damage.<br/>Death Pact cannot sacrifice ancient creeps.<br/>Death Pact's low cooldown means that Clinkz should be using it as often as possible.<br/>Use Death Pact to deny and enemy jungler some farm. Taking the largest creep while leaving the smaller ones will prevent the camp from respawning.<br/>Death Pact instantly kills dominated or controlled units, such as those used by Chen or Enchantress, and units from Necronomicon.<br/>Use Helm of the Dominator to increases creep's health.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Drow Ranger is a deadly archer, chilling and killing her enemies with volleys of Frost Arrows. With one of the highest agility stats in the game, her powerful shots will tear through most enemies from a safe distance. Her Precision Aura increases the damage of her ranged allies, and a timely Gust can silence groups of enemies at pivotal moments. Drow Ranger is fairly fragile with no real escape ability, causing her to struggle against faster and more aggressive melee heroes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High single target damage.<br/>Powerful early pusher.<br/>Good chaser.<br/>Buffs other ranged heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly stat dependent.<br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Fragile and easily ganked.<br/>Slow attack animation.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Drow Ranger is usually played in the safe lane, with a support.<br/>Drow Ranger is easily ganked. Make sure not to overextend if your support is not nearby.<br/> Drow Ranger is all about positioning, since her Marksmanship bonus is disabled if an enemy closes to within 400 range. 
<br/>Stay behind your teammates and use them as a buffer. Reposition throughout fights to keep your tankier teammates between you and the enemy.<br/>Approach fights from the edges, and rely on the slow from Frost Arrows instead of physical proximity to keep enemies in range.<br/>Any item that helps Drow Ranger keep her distance is good, such as Dragon Lance, Shadow Blade, Blink Dagger and Force Staff.<br/>Like other ranged heroes, stutter stepping is useful for Drow Ranger, but not as important due to the slow from Frost Arrows.<br/>Because of her passive abilities, Drow Ranger is slightly less dependent on items than other carries, but can still be shut down in the early game. Be careful not to take any needless risks.<br/>Drow Ranger deals high damage to buildings, and should always capitalize on any opportunity to take down a tower.<br/>Due to her slow attack animation, Drow Ranger should not do anything except farm until at least level six, when her first point in Marksmanship will make her attack much faster.<br/>If you are having trouble timing last hits, try moving closer to the creep wave.<br/>Animation cancelling with the Stop hotkey (S by default) can also help with timing.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Frost Arrows</h4>With level four Frost Arrows, Drow Ranger can kite most melee heroes.<h4>Gust</h4>Gust is Drow Ranger's only means of defense, and should not be used lightly.<br/>Use Gust defensively to push enemies who get too close, keeping them beyond the 400 Marksmanship bonus range.<br/>Use Gust offensively to interrupt enemies who try to react to your attacks with a disable or an escape ability.<br/>With Blink Dagger, Drow Ranger can use Gust to initiate on and gank single targets.<br/>If an enemy is already hit by a long disable (such as cyclone or Disruption), Drow Ranger can move to the opposite side of her target, and push them backwards with Gust right after the first disable ends.<br/>In a teamfight, try to catch as many enemies with Gust as possible, preferably as a follow up to your team's initiator. This will shut down the enemy for several seconds, during which Drow Ranger can pick off one or two targets.<br/>Use Gust on an enemy team in the Roshan Pit to push them further inside, and render them unable to respond.<br/>With good timing, it is possible to push enemies onto different elevations like cliffs.<br/> With a , Drow Ranger can gank by taking a shot to break the invisibility, then immediately using Gust.
<br/>This leaves the target slowed, and silenced, and therefore unable to react (apart from using items).<h4>Precision Aura</h4>If you are having trouble landing last hits, an early point or two in Precision Aura will help.<br/> Don't forget to use Precision Aura's active ability. It is very useful for pushing down towers.
<br/>Since the active applies an aura and not a buff, it works even for ranged creeps/summons that spawn after you use it.<br/>Try to use the active when creep waves have catapults.<br/>The active lasts a considerable 30 seconds, but has a long 120 second cooldown. In the late game, reserve it for sieging barracks, or when going for an all-out attack on the enemy ancient.<br/>Although Precision Aura greatly benefits other ranged heroes, it is usually unwise to have two fragile ranged carries on the same team. Consider this during the picking phase.<h4>Marksmanship</h4>Marksmanship's damage bonus has a particle effect. It disappears when enemies are nearby.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ember Spirit is a very mobile and evasive carry due to his ability to strike from range or dodge enemy attacks using Sleight of Fist and Fire Remnants. Playing Ember Spirit requires quick reflexes, good judgment and an aggressive mindset, as his instant cast animations and high mobility allow skilled players to outplay and outwit opponents, darting around the map to be where they least expect.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great mobility, hard to kill in teamfights.<br/>Global-wide presence, Strong pushing skillset.<br/>Deals AOE physical damage that scales into late game.<br/>Large magical damage in early to mid game.<br/>Absorbs moderate amount of magical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low agility growth.<br/>Weak manfight capability.<br/>Vulnerable to silences and chain stuns.<br/>High requirement for good positioning and reflexes.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>The only benefit of leveling up Fire Remnant is its damage; The number and duration of remnants remains the same. It is viable to level Fire Remnant sooner for more burst damage in incoming teamfight.<br/>When laning against certain heroes (in mid) that rely on skill to harass ( Queen of Pain's Shadow Strike, Shadow Fiend's Shadowraze (Far), Windranger's Powershot), one point in Sleight of Fist might be valuable to dodge their damage. Note that Sleight of Fist dodge skills by rendering Ember Spirit invulnerable rather than disjointing them. As an example, Sleight of Fist should be used just before Shadow Strike hits you, not immediately after the skill being used.<br/>Sleight of Fist doesn't help Ember Spirit farm at all in early to mid game when he has few attack damage items. Flame Guard and Searing Chains help a lot to deal damage, and Fire Remnant helps Ember Spirit move around the map quickly and farm dangerous lanes.<br/>Ember Spirit has mana issues early in the game - using Fire Remnant to chase will often put you in danger. The higher level of Sleight of Fist you get, the further your Searing Chains can hold the enemy.<br/><h3>General</h3>While Xin is an agility hero, Ember Spirit has very low armor and poor agility growth, making him vulnerable to physical damage despite his respectable strength growth. As such, he depends on using his spells and mobility to dodge attacks, disjoint projectiles and evade counterattack. His dependency on casting also makes him vulnerable to disables, particularly stuns and silences, as they prevent him from avoiding damage that his small HP pool is ill-suited to deal with.<br/>In general, Ember Spirit is best played either as a core farmer in the safe lane, or as a mid. As a safe lane farmer, Ember Spirit can safely farm up the items he needs to become a late-game threat, and his mobility allows him to engage on the enemy off-laner unexpectedly and help disable them during ganks, or evade enemy ganks targeted on him. As a mid, getting fast levels early on allows him to gank side lanes and get kills with his mobility and disables, giving him a strong early-game presence and allowing him to snowball out of control.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Searing Chains</h4>Searing Chains is a powerful disable spell that stops up to two nearby enemies in their tracks and deals damage for the duration.<br/>Searing Chains' scaling means that it can be used as a strong early-game damage nuke, and its low cooldown allows it to be cast multiple times in a fight if need be. As such, it is a good candidate for your first ability to max out.<br/>Keep in mind, the targets for Searing Chains are chosen randomly, so creeps can be hit if they are within the spell's radius. When attempting to chain down an enemy player, ensure that there are no creeps nearby that can foul your attempts to disable them, or try to position Ember Spirit such that only the hero and at most one other unit are within the spell's radius.<br/>This ability can be combined with Sleight of Fist, as the latter spell positions Ember Spirit next to the target to be slashed during each strike. This means that Sleight followed by Chains can allow Ember Spirit to root enemies from long range if the combo is timed correctly.<br/>One strong aspect of Searing Chains is that it will root affected targets, preventing them from using true blink abilities as well as a few other escape abilities. As such, it can be very potent against certain heroes that rely on using true blink to escape, such as Anti-Mage and Queen of Pain.<br/>Searing Chains will interrupt channeling spells upon cast. This is most useful for interrupting Town Portal Scrolls, and spells like Black Hole or Death Ward. However, in the case of Town Portal Scrolls, make sure to use the spell only after the enemy begins an attempt to teleport to safety, as Searing Chains' cooldown duration means that they can safely teleport after it has been used.<h4>Sleight of Fist</h4>Sleight of Fist is best described as an area-of-effect physical damage nuke that allows Ember Spirit to apply auto-attack damage to all enemies within the spell's radius.<br/>While this spell does not disjoint projectiles, Ember Spirit is invulnerable for its duration, so any projectiles that hit him during the spell will not affect him. As such, it can be used to effectively dodge damage and disables by becoming invulnerable as the projectile hits him.<br/>Remember that creeps hit by this spell will take half damage from Ember Spirit's strikes and do not take the bonus damage, so it is a poor early farming ability. Only once Ember Spirit has accumulated enough raw damage and a cleave will it be useful for cutting down groups of creeps.<br/>Conversely, as the damage dealt is based on Ember Spirit's attack damage, Sleight of Fist is one of the strongest scaling abilities in the game, since Ember Spirit can apply large amounts of physical damage as well as attack modifiers on the entire enemy team every six seconds. If Ember Spirit builds enough raw damage items, he can potentially wipe the entire enemy team in a single cast of this spell.<br/>Mind that evasion, blind and disarm will affect Sleight of Fist, so it is possible that strikes during this spell will not hit their targets depending on any evasion items the enemy is carrying, or if Ember Spirit is affected by blind or disarm.<br/>Invisible enemies will not be targeted for a slash by this spell, however it will hit enemies in the fog of war. Combined with Searing Chains, this allows Ember Spirit to jump at enemies in the dark and chain them down, which can prevent players from juking into the jungle and teleporting away.<br/>Ember Spirit can still cast spells and use items during Sleight of Fist, though he will still return to his original position regardless. As such, it is possible to execute unorthodox combos such as beginning to channel Town Portal Scroll during the invulnerability or sending a Fire Remnant during the slashes and then jumping to it once done. Be sure to gauge your timing based on the number of targets within the striking area, however, as more targets means a greater slashing duration.<br/>It's very important to remember that, no matter what, Ember Spirit will always return to the position he was in when Sleight of Fist was cast as soon as it's over - Using Blink Dagger, Activate Fire Remnant, teleporting, among other things that can alter his position, are never queued, they occur as soon as they are activated and Ember will continue slashing any left targets if Sleight of Fist had not concluded by then no matter where he is, and then return to the cast position.<br/>Regarding purchasing more than one Battle Fury, bear in mind that your second one will increase your cleave damage by 100%, and your third by 50%. Getting a fourth is not recommended as it increases the damage by 33.3% in relation to your current cleave damage, and as such, it is better to get a Daedalus as the critical chance grants approximately a 35% overall damage increase.<h4>Flame Guard</h4>Flame Guard shields Ember Spirit from magical damage, traditionally an agility carry's greatest weakness, while also allowing him to deal burn damage to all nearby enemies.<br/>Besides the charge restore time on Fire Remnants, Flame Guard is Ember Spirit's longest cooldown ability. As such, try to use it sparingly, as casting it to farm creeps may leave you vulnerable if the enemy attempts to gank you shortly after.<br/>In the early game, Flame Guard gives Ember Spirit protection against magic damage, as well as allowing him to deal it to enemies while chasing them down. As such, Xin is a potent early-game fighter if he has a few points in this ability.<br/>In order to use this spell to its maximum effectiveness, particularly in mid match-ups, try to aim to only skill it to the point where you can ignore the enemy's burst damage attack and still have the shield up to deal burn damage to them. If facing a weak magic nuker in the mid lane, one or two points in this ability can allow you to shrug off their alpha strike, and then continue to deal burn damage to them while also expending the remaining points in Searing Chains, increasing its overall damage and disable duration.<h4>Fire Remnant</h4>Fire Remnant allows Ember Spirit to place a Fire Remnant at the target location, and then cast Activate Fire Remnant to quickly dash to it, exploding it to deal area magical damage.<br/>Fire Remnant is Ember Spirit's primary mobility, initiation and escape ability, as it allows him to re-position himself almost instantly, no matter his position relative to the remnant. As such, it can be used not only to quickly close the distance to an enemy while dealing nuke damage upon arriving, it can also be used to move across the map, whether to escape from an enemy gank or to arrive at a friendly one.<br/>As with Sleight of Fist, Ember Spirit does not disjoint projectiles upon casting Activate Fire Remnant, but is invulnerable during the travel time. As such, it can be used to disjoint projectiles if they connect with him while he is invulnerable, though beware of projectiles continuing to chase you if the remnant's location does not allow you to path over the projectile during the spell. If this is the case, consider having Sleight of Fist ready to cast on any non-friendly creeps at your destination, in order to dodge any projectiles that might follow you across the map.<br/>Beware of Activate Fire Remnant's heavy mana cost, as combined with Ember Spirit's small mana pool it can completely drain him of mana if he tries to cast it more than once or uses it in combination with his other spells. Always keep an eye on your mana to ensure that you're able to cast Activate Fire Remnant when needed, and try to avoid using it more than once in a short period of time as this also depletes your Fire Remnant reserve.<br/>Fire Remnants do not provide any vision and are thus not visible through the fog of war. Remembering where the remnants were placed is important, in order to not get accidentally in danger.<br/>While its most basic use is to initiate on an enemy over distance, Fire Remnants can also be used as an escape tool. By placing one in an area of known safety, Ember Spirit can instantly dash away in the face of overwhelming danger, evading ganks or quickly retreating after a successful kill.<br/>Beware that the Fire Remnant's travel speed is based on that of Ember Spirit when it is sent forth. This means that if Ember Spirit is suffering from slow debuffs, the remnant will take longer to reach its destination, which can give the enemy more time to kill him. As such, it is wise to place a remnant beforehand, or to avoid being affected by slows before casting it. Conversely, this also means that its travel speed can be boosted by increasing Ember Spirit's movement speed, such as using Drum of Endurance's active.<br/>Fire Remnants do not scale very well, as the only thing that increases is the amount of damage dealt by an exploding remnant upon arrival. Unless you regularly use the explosion damage as part of a damage nuke, it is usually wise to skill it at level 6 but to avoid taking additional levels until your other regular abilities are maxed out.<br/>In concert to the above, a dangerous but powerful tactic is to cast all three Fire Remnants at a target location and then dash to them, dealing 300/450/600 near-instantaneous alpha damage. However, keep in mind that this will completely deplete your remnant reserve, greatly reducing your mobility for at least the next 35 seconds.<br/>One useful trick with Fire Remnants is that, due to their global re-positioning potential, they can be dropped in place prior to using a Town Portal Scroll or other globally re-positioning item, and then return to your previous location if so desired. This can be useful for things such as quickly replenishing HP and mana at base, quickly teleporting to defend or counter-gank and then returning to farming/pushing, and so on. In particular, the first tactic is extremely strong when combined with a Bottle, as Ember Spirit can replenish his HP and mana, grab any items from stash, and refill his bottle all at the cost of a Town Portal Scroll and a Fire Remnant charge.<br/>As well as the above, Fire Remnants can be used to quickly return to battle after buying back. If a Fire Remnant is placed near a battle and Ember Spirit is killed, buying back and then casting Activate Fire Remnant can allow him to instantly return to a fight, bringing his damage nukes and disables with him to turn the tide for his team.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Faceless Void is a hero who holds mastery over time. He dashes through the battlefield, rewinding damage with Time Walk, stuns enemies with Time Lock, and causes their abilities to recharge slower with Time Dilation. His signature ability, Chronosphere, creates a bubble in space-time, stopping everything caught within so he and his team can beat down the enemy without retribution. As a melee carry, Faceless Void requires a large amount of farm in order to deal decent damage, but can be devastatingly powerful once he has his items. Faceless Void can be played solo in the off-lane, or with a support in the safe lane.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Fulfills both carry and initiator roles.<br/>Low cooldown escape ability.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item and farm dependent.<br/>No room for mistakes with his ultimate.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Time Lock average stats (hero)<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Time Walk</h4>Time Walk is a Pseudo Blink ability that renders Faceless Void invulnerable as he quickly jumps to the target location.<br/>The most general use for Time Walk is to allow Faceless Void to close the distance to an enemy, either to attack them or to cast Chronosphere. As such, it can be important to get many early levels in this ability to maximize Darkterror's initiation potential.<br/>In a pinch, Time Walk can be used as an escape spell to put distance between Faceless Void and any incoming attackers. However, beware that it does not disjoint projectiles, so attacks that follow him to his destination can still hit him.<br/>Evasion can be useful to build on Faceless Void in order to augment his survivability further. The evasion will prevent secondary effects of physical attacks from proccing, since the attack itself does not count as landing. This can allow Faceless Void to ignore the secondary effects of attacks like Mana Break, Essence Shift, bashes, and so on.<h4>Time Dilation</h4>Time Dilation provides a considerable move and attack speed slow to the debuffed targets, but mostly hinders the opponent's ability to spam spells. Thus, it is best used against heroes that have quick, spammable spells with low cooldowns, such as Invoker's Invoke, Zeus's Arc Lightning or Bristleback's Quill Spray and Viscous Nasal Goo.<br/>It remains potent against enemies with moderate cds, since time dilation's duration may prevent them from casting their spell a second time during an engagement.<br/>If you're fighting an enemy one-on-one, use it when Chronosphere is about to expire instead of at the start, to waste no time on the debuff's duration.<h4>Time Lock</h4>Time Lock is a powerful bash-type passive ability that allows Faceless Void's attacks to stun enemies and deal bonus damage.<br/>Time Lock allows Faceless Void's damage and disable potential to scale tremendously with attack speed, as each proc instance of Time Lock will stun and deal bonus magical damage. With enough attack speed, Faceless Void can keep an enemy almost permanently disabled through repeated bashes, and deal large amounts of damage with those bashes.<br/>Getting several levels in Time Lock, alongside increasing Faceless Void's attack speed, will greatly boost the amount of damage he deals.<br/>Time Lock pierces spell immunity, allowing it to stun enemies who have activated Black King Bar, as well as siege creeps. The former case can be a powerful use of crowd control to disable enemies through spell immunity, while the latter case can be helpful for stopping pushes by removing a siege creep's damage output for a short duration if it is attacking a tower.<h4>Chronosphere</h4>Chronosphere is one of the most powerful and most feared area disables in the game, capable of stopping entire teams in their tracks regardless of spell immunity. Used wisely, it can allow Faceless Void and his allies to kill numerous enemy players with little to no resistance.<br/>Due to its extremely long cooldown, Chronosphere must be used wisely, as Faceless Void is very weak without it. As teamfights do not happen regularly in the early game, Chronosphere can be used to secure kills in the laning phase, however once teamfights start becoming more frequent the spell must be kept in reserve until the right moment.<br/>Faceless Void (as well as any units under his control) gains 1000 movement speed and phase movement inside his own Chronosphere, allowing him to attack any targets within as needed. Try to catch enemies in Chronosphere first, and then select targets once they are disabled. As well, remember that Faceless Void will never be disabled by a Chronosphere, even one cast by an enemy, though he will not gain the movement bonuses inside a Chronosphere that he does not own.<br/>However, be very wary if there is a Rubick on the enemy team. While Faceless Void can still move inside of Rubick's Chronosphere, his teammates cannot. Fortunately, Faceless Void can easily avoid Spell Steal since he is able to cast Time Dilation in order to have it as his last cast spell, but of course, be sure to catch Rubick inside of Chronosphere to ensure that he does not steal it and use it against your teammates.<br/>Take special care when casting Chronosphere; unlike other disables in the game, it is capable of freezing allies in place, not just enemies. Avoid trapping teammates inside a Chronosphere unless a decisive advantage can be secured, and try to place the Chronosphere such that it does not impede allies' movements as they attempt to assist in a teamfight.<br/>It can be useful to target Chronosphere such that part of it can deny terrain to the enemy. Placing the sphere such that the enemy cannot assist without entering the sphere can help ensure that they will not be able to interfere as much, if at all, in a teamfight.<br/>Remember that Chronosphere will freeze buildings as well, not just units; this includes fountains, friendly or enemy. This makes Chronosphere very strong for diving enemy towers and even their fountain, as Faceless Void can prevent them from attacking him and take advantage of the boosted movement speed to enter and leave at high speed.<br/>The key to utilizing Chronosphere properly is target prioritization. Be sure to coordinate with teammates to kill important targets during the Chronosphere, which may not always be the enemy's carry. If Chronosphere can catch supports with powerful spells and teamfight items, killing them first can remove those abilities and items from the field, making the remainder of the fight much harder for the enemy.<br/>As well, Chronosphere's disable potential can be greatly augmented by additional crowd control from teammates. Spells such as Reverse Polarity, Vacuum, Berserker's Call can clump the enemy up together to allow Faceless Void to trap several of them at once. Once clumped together, the enemy becomes extremely vulnerable to area-of-effect nukes such as Chain Frost, Earth Splitter, Sonic Wave, and so on.<br/>It is important to remember that while enemies inside of Chronosphere are helpless, those outside can still hinder Faceless Void's attempts to kill their teammates. This means that spells such as Shallow Grave, Cold Embrace and Purification can foil attempts at getting kills, and disables can still be targeted on Faceless Void to render him unable to act during Chronosphere. This further emphasizes the importance of target prioritization, as it may be necessary to target Chronosphere on supports over carries, or it may be necessary to kill targets outside of the Chronosphere first.<br/>Chronosphere will reveal invisible enemies within the sphere, making it powerful against certain spells like Moonlight Shadow and Shukuchi.<br/>Keep in mind that Faceless Void's longer-than-normal cast animation, combined with the travel time of Time Walk, can allow alert enemies to completely dodge Chronosphere if they react quickly enough. As such, try to cast Chronosphere immediately upon emerging from Time Walk, and try to target it on enemies that do not have the ability to instantly re-position themselves to evade it.<br/>If enemies become invulnerable before Chronosphere is cast, they will not be affected by it, whether it is an ally or enemy. This means that a Juggernaut can continue hitting targets inside with Omnislash, Storm Spirit can travel through with Ball Lightning, and so on.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Gyrocopter is a ranged carry who specializes at dishing out physical and magical damage over a wide area. He presents an unorthodox pattern of carry in that he can deal a large amount of magical damage and crowd control much earlier than other carry heroes thanks to Call Down and Rocket Barrage. As game goes on, Flak Cannon adds up his physical damage output and maintains his threat to entire enemy team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals wide area damage.<br/>High early game damage compared to most carries.<br/>Fast farmer.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Relatively fragile.<br/>Shorter attack range than other ranged carries.<br/>No escape mechanisms.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>As an agility hero with moderate HP pool and no innate escape ability, Gyrocopter is somewhat squishy and relies on item to keep himself alive in fight. His magical damage advantage diminishes after enemy carry becomes magic immune, and as a ranged hero with short attack range he has little advantage in direct manfight with enemy carries if not with a gold gold advantage. Also, most of his damage could be evaded if not timed correctly.<br/>Surprisingly, Gyrocopter could play as a greedy roaming support. By leveling Rocket Barrage and Homing Missile, he can initiate a gank and take down heroes together with his teammates. After gaining advantage he can flash farm using his skills and transit into a semi-carry. Note that more utility items can be made other than traditional carry items here.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Rocket Barrage</h4>Rocket Barrage is a spell which could potentially deal heavy damage around towards a single target and generally should be maxed first.<br/> Rocket Barrage is incredibly powerful against a single enemy, but its damage falls off dramatically if there are multiple targets. Position yourself far from the creeps while close to enemy to make the best use of it.  
<br/>Since Call Down and Flak Cannon deals AoE damage to creeps/illusions/summons, these skills have great synergy with Rocket Barrage and could increase its damage on a single hero.<br/>From patch 6.84, Rocket Barrage has no cast foreswing, so Gyrocopter can simply follow the enemy to release the salvo of rockets.<br/>Gyrocopter can still attack when using Rocket Barrage, however the attack animation may hinder the chase towards enemy. However, with a movement speed advantage (e.g., Boots, Yasha, Butterfly - Flutter) you can remain attacking enemy while chasing, and also feel free to activate in a one-on-one fight when enemy hero has no spell immune.<br/>Rocket Barrage will not cause vision when losing vision of enemy even it is still in range. Call Down and Homing Missile could potentially provide the area vision which may be critical to focus down an enemy.<br/>Rocket Barrage should be spammed in teamfights, however time it well so that the damage could be inflicted on the right enemy.<br/>Use Rocket Barrage for farming or hit and run.<h4>Homing Missile</h4>Homing Missile is an unorthodox single target disable: it launches a missile which takes time to hit the target and can hit the target with surprisingly amount of damage and stun.<br/>There are different strategies in leveling Homing Missile: some common ones include not leveling it until level 22, putting a single point in it in level 10 after adding up other skills then left it behind until level 23, and maxing it out right behind Rocket Barrage. The general idea is that Gyrocopter needs survivability and damage output and would focus less on control as a carry, as Homing Missile doesn’t help on farming; but as a more supportive role leveling Homing Missile may increase chance of getting a kill. The situation varies on situation in every match, so don’t get stuck in one single sequence of skill leveling.<br/>Homing Missile is not a spammable skill on a heavily mana-dependent hero as Gyrocopter, and it is not an effective harass skill in lower levels. The rule of thumb is to only cast the spell when someone comes to help you gank.<br/>Try casting Homing Missile where the enemy has no vision, e.g. behind the tree lines so you could surprise enemy when they actually notice and have little time to run away.<br/>Because Homing Missile has a three-second stop before it starts to move, it is best to cast before the gank initiates – or the enemy could easily run away from the missile, and when it finally hits the target no allies could reach the enemy. On the other hand, the long stun and vision the missile provides gives chance for global skills, e.g. Sun Strike, Nature’s Wrath, to finish out the enemy.<br/>In a team fight, it is best to cast the spell on casters with channeling skills, e.g. Freezing Field and Death Ward. The missile could interrupt the spell if placed early and hinder their judgment to cast their spells. Remember to check whether they have Black King Bar before using this strategy!<br/>Homing Missile has little effect for heroes with innate spell immunity or dodge skills, e.g. Lifestealer, Juggernaut and Puck. However, the missile could force out BKB on enemy carries to avoid being stunned in dangerous places, causing them to have no spell immune in immediate teamfights.<br/>Use it to finish the Enemy off.<h4>Flak Cannon</h4> Flak Cannon acts as a lane-pushing and farming skill, similar to Sleight of Fist (without attack effects), but with a certain amount of time and a relatively high cooldown.
<br/>Flak Cannon could be used to harass enemy in lane at a cost of pushing the lane. Asking supports to pull creeps can mitigate the problem and give the enemy a disadvantage. <br/>Flak Cannon has a 1000 search radius: when a low-health enemy gets out of range, it is possible by activating the skill and attack a nearby creep to finish off.<br/>Using Helm of the Dominator to hire a creep or asking supports to pull neutral camps, especially ancient camps, and clear them up using Flak Cannon could give Gyrocopter a significant gold advantage over enemy carries.<br/>By increasing Gyrocopter’s attack damage, the spell can inflict absurd amount of damage on summoned units and squishy supports, forcing them to back off. However, Flak Cannon has a 30 second cooldown and will not hit units in Fog of War. Unawareness of the timing may cause the spell on cooldown or used with no enemies around in teamfights, wasting its great damage potential.<br/>Flak Cannon does not apply most of attack effects, e.g. Crits and cold attack, however it does provide true strike when holding Monkey King Bar. Because of this, players usually purchase Monkey King Bar over Daedalus.<h4>Call Down</h4> Call Down is Gyrocopter’s greatest teamfight ability. It provides a AoE slow and damage in a large area, forcing enemy to back off to avoid the negative effects. Its low cooldown ensures that it could be used in every single teamfight or gank.
<br/>Call Down provides vision of the targeted area. Together with its large area it could prevent jukes.<br/>Beware of its 2 second delay: enemy could simply run away if they see your cast animation. The red indicator is only visible to allies, so it is better to predict the enemy’s movement and drop the bomb right on time, or cast it together with control on allies or your Homing Missile.<br/>Call Down synergies with area control, e.g. Chronosphere or Ravage. Try to communicate with your teammates so the spell could be used at its best.<br/>In fact, Gyrocopter relies on his ultimate so much that he has little teamfight availability until he gets his ult. Keep this in mind and gain your level as quickly as possible.<br/>The slow does not penetrate spell immunity, and the damage of the spell falls off late game. Thus it is crucial to keep Gyrocopter farmed to keep its teamfight advantage.<br/>Call Down could be used to clear creep waves later in the game and stacked camps together with Flak Cannon to increase Gyrocopter’s farming speed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Juggernaut is a formidable swordsman capable of engaging and cutting down single enemies without much risk to himself. A medium carry, Juggernaut can support his teammates with Healing Ward, and escape dangerous situations with Blade Fury. In a one-on-one fight, Juggernaut's Omnislash is the most powerful single target ability in the game, usually killing his opponent if no other enemies are around to absorb the damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High single target damage.<br/>Strong mid game presence.<br/>Can play aggressively in lane.<br/>Farms quickly.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Weak against multiple targets.<br/>Falls off against hard carries in the late game.<br/>Somewhat fragile.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Juggernaut is usually played in the safe lane, with a support.<br/>Juggernaut can opt to go for a farming route, emphasizing his late game damage output. This requires an early Battle Fury.<br/>Juggernaut can also go for a higher single target damage/Omnislash route, building items like Aghanim's Scepter or Desolator.<br/>Juggernaut excels in the mid game, where he can pick off enemies easily with Omnislash. Try to gain a dominant footing during this time.<br/>In the late game, harder carries like Spectre or Anti-Mage will surpass Juggernaut.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Blade Fury</h4>While Blade Fury does no damage to towers, Juggernaut can still autoattack while using it. The small white flashes in the middle of the tower indicate his attacks landing.<h4>Healing Ward</h4>One point in Healing Ward is useful to help Juggernaut stay in lane against heavy harassment.
<br/>Soul Ring is sometimes purchased for this reason, so Juggernaut can use the Healing Ward constantly.<br/>Put down Healing Ward before a teamfight to keep your team alive.
<br/>Keep in mind Juggernaut's low mana. Placing a Healing Ward may make him unable to use Omnislash.<br/>Place the Healing Ward slightly off to the side of your team to prevent it from being instantly destroyed by ranged enemies like Sniper.<br/>Set a hotkey, or have Healing Ward follow you or another teammate for easier control.<br/>Use Healing Ward to help Juggernaut and his teammates retreat from a bad situation.<br/>Use Healing Ward when attacking towers or Roshan to negate the incoming damage, and secure what would otherwise be a dangerous position.<br/>The Healing Ward moves slightly faster than most heroes, meaning it can be sent out ahead of Juggernaut to help an ailing ally.<br/>The Healing Ward can be used to scout ahead, up high ground, and into the Roshan Pit. This tactic is highly situational, as the Healing Ward is quite precious and should not be expended lightly.<br/>Remember to move the Healing Ward even after Juggernaut is dead to keep teammates healed.<h4>Blade Dance</h4>Blade Dance benefits most from items that increase raw damage.<br/>The critical damage from Blade Dance is insignificant until Juggernaut has a few items, meaning it can be leveled after other abilities.<h4>Omnislash</h4>An injured Juggernaut lures an overzealous Sven away from lane creeps, using Blade Fury to avoid being disabled. Once the enemy is alone, Juggernaut turns the tables with Omnislash.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lone Druid is an adaptive carry who controls a durable Spirit Bear to wreak havoc on the battlefield. With two separate item inventories, the pair acts like two complimentary heroes that can be played a number of ways: with Lone Druid providing buffs from the back while the Spirit Bear fights on the front lines, or with Lone Druid attacking from long range while the Spirit Bear scouts and split pushes. This arrangement allows the Lone Druid to stay on the fringes of conflict, thus risking his own life less than most other carries. However, if the Spirit Bear falls in battle, the Lone Druid himself becomes significantly less effective. Because of the micro-management needed to control the Spirit Bear, Lone Druid can be a daunting hero for newer players.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Faster pusher and building destroyer.<br/>Strong at early-mid game fights.<br/>Scales well into the late game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Few realistic options for increasing Spirit Bear's durability.<br/>Requires a moderate amount of micro skill.<br/>Often highly dependent on his Spirit Bear.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lone Druid is most dominant in the mid-game. Try to gain an advantage during this period.<br/>If a match goes late, Lone Druid should consider building more damage on his bear, making his bear as powerful as he is.<br/>Lone Druid can be played with very little micro, but in order to be of maximum effectiveness the bear must be controlled separately, almost as a second hero.<br/>Lone Druid can use his bear to pick up runes, you can send the bear to easily steal the enemy bounty rune while you stay in lane.<br/>The Spirit Bear can buy and deliver items and act as personal courier if you either cannot get to the shop yourself or it is too much of a risk to send a courier.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Summon Spirit Bear</h4>The Spirit Bear is extremely durable, and can be used to tank lane creeps and jungle creeps in the early game.<br/>An early Orb of Venom or Blight Stone on the Spirit Bear makes him very adept at harassing lane opponents.<br/>When killed, the Spirit Bear gives a very large bounty of gold and experience to the enemy, similar to losing a hero. Do not let your bear die.<br/>If you suspect an upcoming engagement, you can use the bear to scout and use its Return to keep it from dying.<br/>The Spirit Bear can deny Lone Druid, and vice versa.<br/>When retreating, use the Spirit Bear to slow down chasing enemies with Entangle. 
<br/>Remember that Lone Druid takes 10% of his max health as damage if Spirit Bear dies.<br/>The Spirit Bear can be denied to prevent the enemy from getting the gold bounty, and it also prevents the Backlash damage.<br/>Send the Spirit Bear out to push and attack buildings, especially up the high ground to hit tier 3 towers.<br/>Unlike heroes, the Spirit Bear's does not gain stats. This means it will not be able to fight hard carries during the late game.<br/>If the Spirit Bear is about to die in a teamfight, you can try to transfer its items to Lone Druid so he can continue the fight.<br/>Keep in mind that the Spirit Bear's damage type is basic, meaning that its attack damage is reduced by 25% when attacking heroes and creep-heroes.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Rabid</h4>Rabid's low cooldown and mana cost means the Lone Druid can keep the buff on almost all the time. Level 4 Rabid has a 100% up-time.<br/>Use Rabid to help the Spirit Bear catch up to a fleeing enemy and catch them with Entangle.<br/>Rabid can be used both offensively and defensively. If you have to run away, Rabid's speed buff is most likely to allow you to escape a gank or a teamfight if the enemies don't have lockdowns.<br/>Unlike Battle Cry, Rabid does not affect any other units under Lone Druid's control besides the Spirit Bear.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Savage Roar</h4>To save an outnumbered ally, send out the Spirit Bear and use Savage Roar to scatter the enemy.<br/>Use Savage Roar to push enemies into your allies.<br/>Send the Spirit Bear into the Roshan Pit, and use Savage Roar to interrupt enemies attacking Roshan.<br/>Savage Roar can be used to disrupt other taunt spells if it is used after them.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>True Form</h4>True Form is usually leveled much later than other ultimate abilities, either due to Lone Druid's reliance on his Spirit Bear, or because his build is designed to attack at range with Druid Form.<br/>Spirit Form has a cast time, during which Lone Druid cannot move. Be careful when using it while retreating, as the transform time could allow enemies to catch up with Lone Druid.<br/>Transform into bear form before a fight to make Lone Druid more durable.<br/>Transform into bear form in an emergency to save Lone Druid by gaining extra health.<br/>Transform just before a projectile hits to disjoint it.<br/>Although Lone Druid is much tankier in his bear form, he is usually not strong enough to last long in an intense fight, especially if his Spirit Bear has half of his items.<br/>Transforming into human form makes Lone Druid move faster, but will greatly reduce his maximum health.
<br/>When retreating, only transform back to human form when no enemies are close enough to kill or disable Lone Druid.<br/>True Form lowers Lone Druid's Base Attack Time, effectively increasing his attack speed and making all his attack speed items more effective.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Luna is a highly offensive carry who can demolish buildings and clear the battlefield in very little time. Along with her flying Moon Glaives, Luna can call upon the goddess Selemene to cover the battlefield in an Eclipse, striking down large numbers of enemies at once. Being a purely offensive hero, Luna suffers from a lack of defensive abilities, and will struggle against carries that are geared towards one-on-one combat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Hits multiple targets at once.<br/>Fast pusher and farmer.<br/>Good night vision.<br/>High magical damage output during the early game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/>No defense mechanisms.<br/>Short attack range.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Easily kited by high-mobility heroes.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because Luna has no means of escaping ganks, she is usually played in the safe lane, with a support. Her Lunar Blessing increases support's right click damage, making lane harassment easier.<br/> Luna can be played in a solo lane, but this is risky due to her fragility and short attack range.
<br/>Solo Luna is usually done to give her a level advantage early on, because Luna can snowball off of an early team fight with Eclipse and catch-up in farm very quickly with Moon Glaives, especially if she managed to stack a couple of jungle camps.<br/>A very odd trait for a hard carry is that Luna gains significant killing power with a level advantage because of Lucent Beam, and by extension Eclipse.<br/> Luna is an extremely potent pusher, especially when attacking barracks, as her Moon Glaives will bounce between multiple buildings with each attack.
<br/>Because of this, Luna should be present as often as possible to take down towers with her team.<br/>Any source of lifesteal greatly boosts Luna's survivability in the late game.<br/>Creep stacking is very useful for Luna. Ask an ally to start stacking for you early on.<br/>Tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Lucent Beam</h4>Lucent Beam's cast range is gigantic. Use it to pick off fleeing heroes.<br/>Lucent Beam mini-stuns. Use to interrupt teleporting and channeling heroes.<br/>Lucent Beam has a low cooldown, but should not be spammed too often due to Luna's mediocre mana pool.<br/>From level 2 on, Lucent Beam can be used effectively to harass enemies out of the lane. Build a Ring of Basilius or Infused Raindrop to obtain some form of mana regen in lane.<br/>Use Lucent Beam after Eclipse to keep the target inside Eclipse's radius a little longer.<br/>Lucent Beam is good for last-hitting when you can't/don't want to get near a creep. This is especially true when contesting a big jungle creep with an opponent.<h4>Moon Glaive</h4>Early points in Moon Glaive will push the lane, and is usually not recommended until laning phase has concluded.<br/>Moon Glaive is the ability that allows Luna to clear creeps and demolish buildings extremely quickly.<br/>Moon Glaive has no effect on lone enemies, so try to keep all neutrals and lane creeps at roughly the same HP level when farming.<br/>Occasionally Can be used to attack targets up to 830 range away, for example strike one last time to a fleeing enemy by attacking a tower.<br/>The number of bounces increase by 3 between level 3 and level 4. Assuming the glaives bounce as much as possible, they increase Luna's damage by 65%/107%/135%/172%.<h4>Lunar Blessing</h4>A point or two in Lunar Blessing helps Luna score last hits, especially at level 1.<br/>Lunar Blessing's damage bonus makes a big difference in the early game, when a few auto attacks from Luna's teammates can kill a weaker enemy.<br/>Put one point in Lunar Blessing before the first night, as it will provide Luna with its bonus night vision. It is nearly always crucial to max it fast since Eclipse sets the time to night. That means, upgrading it effectively increases Luna's ultimate's range when alone or without vision.<br/>Lunar Blessing is best to max early in a 5-man strategy when the bonus damage is still relatively high compared to the base damage.<h4>Eclipse</h4>Eclipse has a very long cooldown. Use wisely.<br/>Always underestimate, not overestimate Eclipse's range. It cannot hit ennemies out of vision.<br/> Eclipse is most powerful in early to mid game, and should be taken advantage of.
<br/>Because of this, Eclipse can be considered an early game ganking ability.<br/>Against weaker opponents, you may get a kill (or two) while pushing a tower. If they TP to defend it and there are no enemy creeps, they've just set themselves up for Eclipse's full blast.<br/> While a full Eclipse deals tremendous damage, experienced enemies will usually save their escape mechanisms precisely to avoid this.
<br/>Disables, slows, Force Staff, and movement abilities like Blink will allow enemies to move out of Eclipse's range.<br/>In the late game, Eclipse deals less damage, as many heroes will have Black King Bar.<br/>Use Eclipse in narrow or confined spaces to make sure enemies don't move out of its radius.<br/> Use Eclipse near a single enemy to deal heavy damage. 
<br/>A level one Eclipse will usually kill a solitary target during the early game.<br/> With , Eclipse has an enormous cast range and can be cast on the ground or an ally unit.
<br/>Use upgraded Eclipse on your team's initiator to deal more damage. This keeps Luna out of harm's way while still doing damage with Eclipse. Note that Eclipse ends when the targeted ally dies in this case.<br/>Use upgraded Eclipse on the ground in front of allied towers to defend the tower, or behind enemy towers while pushing.<br/>Use upgraded Eclipse on an invisible ally and let them wreak havoc for you.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Medusa is a very hard carry who can easily turn teamfights around in her favor. Her Mana Shield makes her one of the tankiest carries in the game, but her extreme item dependence requires her to farm for much of the game before she can be effective in teamfights. Split Shot allows her to farm really fast in the jungle and deal considerable damage to multiple heroes in fights. However, her early game is filled with problems, such as having the lowest base HP in the game, very little mana, and slow movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very powerful in late game.<br/>Effective against multiple opponents.<br/>Great crowd control.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow movement speed<br/>Very fragile in early game.<br/>Extremely item dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Medusa has one of the lowest base health in the game, making her quite vulnerable in the early game.<br/>Medusa is arguably the hardest carry in the game, but also the most item dependent. Knowing how to farm well is the most important aspect of playing her.<br/>Early on, Medusa should just focus on farming and surviving. Once you get Mana Shield, you'll have a lot more survivability in lane, but always keep an eye on the minimap for incoming ganks and your health and mana pools to see how much damage the enemies are doing.<br/> In the late game, Mana Shield and Stone Gaze allows Medusa to withstand much more punishment than most carries. 
<br/>Enemy teams who cannot kill Medusa quickly enough will often lose the teamfight.<br/>Because of this, a well farmed late game Medusa can often turn a losing match around.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Split Shot</h4> Split Shot makes you a really good farmer and pusher, especially once you get more levels in it. Use it to quickly farm jungle camps or push lanes to try to take early towers
<br/>When pushing towers with Split Shot, keep the tower as your main target, and the other arrows will hit creeps or nearby enemies. If you target creeps while trying to push, the extra arrows won't hit towers.<br/>Split Shot also gives you immense damage during fights. While Medusa's single target damage isn't much for a lot of the game, with Split Shot you can easily deal decent damage to each enemy in a fight.<br/>Keep in mind activating this ability reduces the damage of your attacks by 20%. Remember to turn this off when facing single targets or just deal more damage to certain enemies.<br/>Split Shots works on Medusa's illusions, but only if it is active when the illusions are spawned. Spawn illusions with Split Shot on to increase their DPS and pushing power.<br/>It is possible to farm ancients with Medusa at level 1 by putting a point into Split Shot. However, it requires juking into the jungle, and may need more skill to perform in on the Dire ancients.<h4>Mystic Snake</h4>Mystic Snake is potent throughout all points of the game. It lets you harass enemies and keep your mana nearly full while posing minimum risk to yourself<br/>For maximum damage against enemies in lane, try to bounce the snake off a few creeps into the enemy hero.<br/>The mana steal works against heroes and creeps to the full extent. Use this in the jungle to keep Mana Shield's EHP from dropping too low so you can tank hits from creeps. Medium Satyr and Mud Golem camps work the best for this.<br/>Mystic Snake deals Pure damage to enemies petrified by Stone Gaze, so be sure to cast it after activating Stone Gaze.<br/>Both in lane and in the jungle, take advantage of Mystic Snake to keep your mana up so Mana Shield keeps you alive.<br/>Mystic Snake can be maxed first as it is Medusa's only nuke and can be used to push your lane.<br/>Mystic Snake's damage increases per jump, so it is best cast so that it would hit enemy heroes at last, to make them take the most damage. If used for farming, casting it so that it hits the creeps with more health can prevent overkill damage on lower health creeps, making it more effective and faster to farm.<br/>Since Medusa does not have much mana and the ability has a high mana cost, it is important to make sure that it hits at least 2 enemies which have mana (e.g. ranged lane creeps), to get some mana restored back. It does not matter if targets with mana are hit as first or at last, since the mana drain is static and does not increase per jump like the damage.<br/>Lane creeps have a mana pool of 500, so Mystic Snake can drain 55/70/85/100 mana from them. So in order to get its full mana cost basically refunded, it has to hit at least 3/3/2/2 ranged lane creeps. This means it is also important to hit enemies with the spell in order to not run out of mana during the laning phase.<br/>In order to refund the full mana cost, Mystic Snake must hit units with a sum of 1273/1072/942/850 total mana.<br/>Use Mystic Snake on a nearby creep to have it bounce and hit an enemy that's out of range.<h4>Mana Shield</h4>One point in Mana Shield gives you the full 60% damage reduction. Subsequent levels just lower the mana lost per damage.<br/>Level Mana Shield based on what the enemy has. If enemies have items such as Diffusal Blade, grabbing more points may not be a bad idea to lower the overall mana lost from it.<br/>Even if you do level Mana Shield up early, be wary of enemies who tend to build illusions with mana burn, such as Anti-Mage with his Mana Break and Manta Style illusions.<br/>Medusa's mana pool needs to equal at least 93.75%/78.95%/68.18%/60% of her current health to maximize the damage reduction of Mana Shield, assuming she does not lose mana in any different way than by the absorption of Mana Shield.<br/>Be wary about leaving Mana Shield active in the early game without a high mana pool or some mana regen items. Heavy damage may leave you unable to cast Stone Gaze, which can turn the tides of a gank or teamfight when used correctly.<br/>Mana Shield does, however, provide an immense amount of damage reduction at all levels. An alternative build is to max this by 7 and take a lot of points in stats.<br/>The ideal ratio of mana to health is 0.94/0.79/0.68/0.6 mana per health, meaning every consecutive skill point in Mana Shield becomes less cost efficient, consider grabbing a point in your other skill points over another point in mana shield if you already have the ideal mana/health ratio (any more points basically mean wasted mana; do not forget about Stone Gaze and Mystic Snake costs)<h4>Stone Gaze</h4>Leveling Stone Gaze only increases the duration by 1 second each level. As such, one value point early on should be enough for both escaping ganks and turning the tides in team fights.<br/>Stone Gaze goes through Magic Immunity, meaning the only way to escape it is to turn away from the Medusa. It'll even freeze a Puck who used Phase Shift and take them out of the Phase, so use that to your advantage.<br/>Mystic Snake deals pure damage to enemies who have been turned to stone by Stone Gaze. Considering that Mystic Snake also increases damage per jump, you can deal massive nuking damage if you bounce it correctly after ulting.<br/> Proper use of Stone Gaze together with Split Shot makes Medusa a great counter to heroes that depend on illusions.
<br/>However, be very wary with its activation - smart users may attempt to use illusions to bait you either by taking you to poor spots or by forcing your ultimate out, which can leave you very vulnerable, especially to heroes like Phantom Lancer as they almost always build Diffusal Blade (making your mana shield much less effective) and he can easily overwhelm you beyond your capacities even with Split Shot active.<br/>Remember that Petrified heroes take no damage from magical attacks. This is especially important if you have a nuke heavy team as activating Stone Gaze at the wrong time can cost your team a battle that could have been won otherwise.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Meepo is one of the most unique heroes in all of Dota, with the ability to split into up to five bodies. While he requires intensive micro-management, once mastered Meepo is capable of farming, pushing and ganking (maybe all at once) more successfully than most other heroes in the game. Earthbind allows Meepo to trap an enemy for an extended period of time, as all of Meepo's clones share individual cooldowns on abilities. Poof allows his clones to teleport to other clones, including the original Meepo, while also doing considerable amounts of damage, especially when several Meepos use it at the same time.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has up to 5 independent bodies.<br/>Very fast farmer.<br/>Sheer numbers overwhelms enemies.<br/>Can disable enemies repeatedly.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very vulnerable against area nuke abilities.<br/>Very micro-intensive.<br/>Very hard to play.<br/>Requires lots of farm to be effective.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>With his ultimate, Meepo is the fastest farmer in the game. Played correctly, Meepo should have a large level advantage compared all other players in the game.<br/>Meepo's clones have higher pitched voice responses compared to the original Meepo. Use this as an audio cue to determine which Meepo is selected.<br/>You can bind a shortcut to each Meepo by doing Ctrl + a number. Attach the number 2 to 5 to the clones and 1 for the main Meepo, the shortcut will be saved for every game. This allows you to control individual clones with greater ease.<br/>In order to play Meepo well, it is necessary to possess strong micromanagement skills, as well as a powerful sense of map awareness. As each individual clone must be managed and moved around the map, Meepo can potentially be present everywhere on the map and congregate to focus their power when needed. However, at the same time this means that the death of one clone will mean the death of them all, so it is necessary to keep them out of harm's way and to know where it is safe to place the clones.<br/>Keep in mind that despite his higher magic resistance, Meepo is very vulnerable to area disables that can disable multiple clones at a time, as well as area-of-effect spells that deal more damage to grouped up targets like the clones. As well, powerful single-target nukes and Pure damage can make Meepo easy prey against heroes that are able to single out a single clone and burst it down.<br/>Generally, Meepo is played as a mid hero due to his unique ultimate. By getting an early level 3, Meepo can use the clone to help with last-hitting, scout out runes, stack camps, look for ganks and relay back to base for regen by using Poof. The clone augments Meepo's lane presence, and can serve to provide extra nuking and disable power if a support rotates mid to help you gank.<br/>Meepo can also be played as a safe-lane carry, as his low base damage and dependence on levels and farm in order to be effective means that he must be protected by his team. The objective of a safe-lane Meepo is to get level 3 as early as possible, then shuttle the clone to stack and farm jungle camps or serve as a base relay when needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Earthbind</h4>Earthbind is an area-targeted root that allows Meepo and his clones to pin down multiple enemies at a time.<br/>While weak by itself, Earthbind increases linearly in duration with the number of clones available. Since each clone has its own mana and cooldowns, each clone can increase the disable duration by two seconds. With four or more clones, it is possible to keep an enemy permanently rooted to the ground if they do not have spell immunity.<br/>In general, only one level in Earthbind is needed in the early game, as Meepo's skill points are better spent on his nukes and damage output. As well, the only things that scale as Earthbind is leveled up are the cooldown and cast range; decreasing the cooldown does not matter much in the early game since each clone has its own cooldown, and the cast range usually does not matter during early game ganks with assisting disables from allies. The spell only truly becomes powerful when Meepo has enough clones and damage output to make the most of the disable.<br/>While Earthbind has a very slow cast animation and travel speed, it is nonetheless a strong disable since it cannot be blocked by Linken's Sphere, and its low cooldown and long cast range at maximum level allows Meepo to hold down all enemies in its radius indefinitely if he has an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/>Despite not being able to hit invisible enemies, Earthbind will reveal any caught enemies if they go invisible. When combined with detection items, Earthbind becomes a strong counter to abilities like Shukuchi, Shadow Walk and Moonlight Shadow.<br/>In order to reduce the liability of Earthbind's slow windup time, it is best to try to get as close to an enemy as possible before casting Earthbind. When cast at point-blank range, the only delay will be Meepo's cast animation, as the travel time of the net will not factor in.<br/>Conversely, Earthbind's extremely long cast range makes it a powerful disable even at long range. Used properly, Earthbind can catch enemies that are out of range of other disables, even if Meepo does not directly engage the enemy.<br/>Keep in mind that all root disables will prevent True Blinks, Charge of Darkness and Phase Shift from being cast. This makes Earthbind a very strong spell to use against certain heroes that rely on those spells for survivability, such as Anti-Mage, Puck and Queen of Pain.<h4>Poof</h4>Poof is perhaps Meepo's most powerful ability, as it provides linearly scaling nuke damage as well as global mobility on a low cooldown.<br/>Due to its low mana cost and large nuking power, Poof should be maxed out as early as possible. While weak by itself, the damage increases tremendously as more clones become available, and the spell allows Meepo to have a global presence with enough clones.<br/>Poof's damage is dealt twice, once at Meepo's starting location and again at the destination. As well, Poof can target itself, so a Meepo can Poof in place to deal twice the listed damage around himself. The most efficient way to utilize Poof is to always ensure that there are enemies at both the jump-off and arrival locations, so that damage is dealt at both ends.<br/>The key to utilizing Poof effectively is to have Meepos spread out across the map. If it is necessary to bring full force to bear at any one location, all Meepos can Poof to that location; if escape is necessary, the endangered Meepo is guaranteed to have a different Meepo to arrive at.<br/>If a Meepo is in danger, usually the best way to survive is to simply Poof to another Meepo. Unless the enemy has long-duration silences, chain disables, or a tremendous amount of damage output, they will usually be unable to kill a Meepo inside of its 1.5 second cast animation.<br/>Remember that the target of a Poof is chosen at the end of the cast animation. This can cause the spell to foul up when targeting moving Meepos, as moving the target Meepo too far away from where the spell was targeted can cause it to select a different Meepo to arrive at. Therefore, if your Meepos are grouped close together, try to "lead" Poof and target it at where you expect the destination Meepo will be after 1.5 seconds.<br/>When using Poof for an alpha nuke, remember that it must be cast individually for each Meepo; selecting a group and casting Poof will only cause the first one in that group to cast the spell. Each Meepo must be cycled and individually commanded to cast Poof.<br/>Activating the Quick Cast option when using Poof can make the spell easier to use, as it reduces the delay as well as the number of required key presses to command the clone army to all Poof.<h4>Geostrike</h4>Geostrike drastically increases the attack and disabling power of Meepo as he accrues more clones, as each clone also procs Geostrike.<br/>Next to Poof, Geostrike should be prioritized to level up for Meepo, as each clone will linearly increase its effect. With five Meepos, it is possible to slow an individual target by 100% and deal 200 magical damage per second.<br/>Geostrike is most powerful when all clones are focused on attacking the same target, as they can reduce a target's movement speed down to the minimum possible, effectively trapping them in place.<br/>One aspect of Geostrike is that it is not a Unique Attack Modifier, and it can be shared with illusions. This means that Meepo can build an attack modifier to stack on top of it (note that clones will not gain this modifier), and that illusions can be used alongside clones to further augment the slow and damage.<h4>Divided We Stand</h4>Divided We Stand is Meepo's signature ability, and perhaps the most unique ability in the whole game. It duplicates Meepo, giving him a clone that has its own individual spells, mana and cooldowns.<br/>Unlike other ultimate abilities in the game, Divided We Stand can be skilled as early as at level 3, and subsequently at 10 and 17. This means that unlike other heroes who reach their minimum effectiveness at level 6, Meepo only has to wait until 3 before he starts being active.<br/>The key to playing Meepo effectively is to micromanage the clones and have them accomplish things all across the map simultaneously. For instance, the clones can be individually commanded to stack neutral camps, and then congregated to farm them, all while another Meepo is last-hitting lane creeps. As well, a pair of clones can be used to push a tower, while another pair prepares for a gank. Be creative and always active with the clones, and make sure that you are always doing something with them.<br/>In order to make micromangement easier, it is wise to assign command groups to the Meepos so that a group or each individual clone can be selected instantly at the press of a key. It is possible to cycle though each Meepo individualy, allowing for Blink-Poof combos in conjunction with Meepo Prime. Assigning individuals to single groups allows them to be issued separate commands as needed.<br/>For the purposes of experience, each Meepo clone is regarded as a hero. This allows Meepo to gain levels and farm gold extremely quickly, as each clone's experience is added to Meepo's total, allowing him to gain experience in different parts of the map all at once. While each clone is statistically weak, Meepo can offset this by exploiting these experience mechanics, giving himself more levels (and thus more attributes and stronger abilities from those levels) than heroes on the opposing team.<br/>In general, Meepo's clones are best moved in groups of two or three. Two Meepos can roam and farm jungle camps fairly easily, and provide mutual support when fighting or ganking. If one group runs into an enemy, they have the option of Poofing out to the other group in case of danger, or summoning reinforcements as they engage.<br/>Combined with Poof, clones can act as anchors for keeping all Meepos' HP and mana full. When a Meepo is in the fountain, other weakened Meepos can be sent home as well via Poof, and then return to the battlefield just as quickly. Using Poof to reduce Meepo's turnaround time is crucial to remaining active throughout a match and accomplishing objectives.<br/>Remember to abuse Meepo's global mobility as much as possible, and use that mobility to outmaneuver the enemy. If Meepo has clones in different areas of the map, he can congregate them at any of their locations to best exploit a weakness in the enemies' position. If the enemy team is grouped on or have recently teleported to one side of the map, Poofing a number of clones to the opposite side can allow them to push a lane and threaten to take one of their towers. If a clone happens upon a lone support, instant reinforcements can be summoned for an easy kill. If two of the enemy's cores are spotted attempting to gank a group of clones, the clones can be pulled to safety by Poofing to another group, wasting the enemy's time and movement.<br/>When equipped with a Blink Dagger, Meepo's textbook initiation is: command all clones to Poof on Meepo Prime > Blink Dagger on Meepo Prime to jump on top of target > Earthbind target > Poof on Meepo Prime. If executed quickly enough, the clones will all Poof in on top of Meepo Prime right after he blinks in, dealing tremendous damage to the target and putting them in perfect position to inflict the target with Geostrike and further immobilizing them with follow-up Earthbinds.<br/>In general, Meepo benefits from building raw attribute items in order to make full use of Aghanim's Scepter, and aura items that provide benefits to all Meepos. Items built will generally vary according to the situation.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Mirana is a very well-rounded hero who can fill almost any role required by her team. Her array of spells gives her the ability to disable, nuke, push, escape and gank in any number of situations. The teamwide invisibility from her Moonlight Shadow is one of the best ganking tools in the game. Depending on the lineup, Mirana is capable of playing as a carry, semi-carry, roamer, support, and even has minor jungling capabilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very long range stun.<br/>Team invisibility.<br/>Good escape mechanism.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Does not excel at any one role.<br/>Requires good aim.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of her low base strength and mediocre strength growth, Mirana is quite frail unless she builds survivability items; instead, she focuses on leveraging Leap and Moonlight Shadow to give herself and her team mobility and strategic advantages over the enemy, which can transition into victorious ganks and teamfights. As well, her poor intelligence growth means that unless she is built as a support with mana items, she will often have to rely on teammates to provide her with mana via Arcane Boots or mana-replenishing abilities.<br/>Be mindful that with her pitiful base damage and slow missile speed, Mirana often has trouble last-hitting to get gold and experience in the laning stage. When played as a carry, purchasing starting items that boost Mirana's attack damage can greatly aid in last-hitting.<br/>One of carry Mirana's greatest strengths is that, as a ranged agility hero, her physical damage is able to scale well without relying on a Unique Attack Modifier. As such, she is able to build an attack modifier as she sees fit according to the situation.<br/>Mirana's spells can be difficult to use properly due to her long 0.5 second cast animation, almost twice as long as most other heroes. This is especially true for Sacred Arrow, as the cast animation, projectile travel speed and enemy movement must all be taken into account. Be sure to position accordingly and cast ahead of time in order to account for this.<br/>Because both of her escape abilities are spells that must be cast, Mirana is particularly vulnerable to silences that prevent her from casting Leap and Moonlight Shadow. As such, building an item that allows her to dispel debuffs from herself is crucial no matter what role she is played in.<br/> Mirana's item and skill build can change drastically depending on what role she plays and how much farm priority she is given. There is no one-size-fits-all build for Mirana, as she can change her skill and item build depending on the situation, and even alter it in the middle of matches.
<br/>In general, as a carry, Mirana focuses on increasing her survivability and building items to boost the power of her physical attacks, and using her spells to gank or help in setting up kills to further boost her gold gain. Due to her mediocre attribute growth, she focuses on ambushing and ganking enemies through hit-and-run attacks rather than taking their carry head-on. Mirana can be played as a carry in the safe lane, or as a semi-carry in the off-lane due to her ability to use Leap to escape enemy gank attempts.<br/>As an early-game roamer, Mirana focuses on using Sacred Arrow to set up First Blood for her team. Successful kills on important enemy heroes, particularly their mid-laner or solo off-laner, can greatly set them back and give Mirana's team a strong laning advantage, which can transition into a farm and experience advantage from the mid-game onward. If successful, Mirana herself can transition into building utility items for her team, and play a semi-carry role.<br/>When played as a support, Mirana initially focuses on building items to increase the size of her mana pool, and using her spells to add nuke damage and disable to teamfights. She then transitions into building support items that provide utility for her team, as well as performing the other normal support duties. Support Mirana generally babysits her safe lane carry, occasionally roaming to the mid-lane for kill attempts with Sacred Arrow.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Starstorm</h4>Starstorm calls down meteors that strike all enemy units near Mirana, with a second star striking the closest unit for additional damage.<br/>Starstorm is a general-purpose magic nuke that allows Mirana to deal damage to all nearby enemies, as well as additional bonus damage to the closest unit.<br/>Because of its area nuke ability, Starstorm is a good spell to max out early in a core farming role. The wide area damage combined with the low cooldown allows Mirana to farm creep waves and neutral camps very quickly, bolstering her gold and experience gain.<br/>Be mindful that Starstorm's mana cost increases with each level, which can hinder Mirana's ability to cast it repeatedly. It is recommended to secure a reliable source of mana replenishment if you intend on using it to farm over long periods of time.<br/>In order to utilize the damage of the second star, try to stand as close as possible to the target you want to take the extra damage prior to casting the spell. The target for the second star is determined upon initial cast, so subsequent movement will not affect it.<br/>Starstorm's large fall radius allows it to hit all enemy units in a surprisingly wide area. If casting the spell to hit as many enemies as possible, try to stand as close to the center of their formation as possible.<h4>Sacred Arrow</h4>Sacred Arrow, Mirana's signature ability, throws an arrow in the targeted direction, dealing damage and stunning the first enemy it hits based on its travel duration. If it hits a non-friendly non-Ancient creep, it is instantly killed.<br/>Sacred Arrow is considered one of the most difficult spells to land in the entire game, however landing a long-ranged arrow can deal tremendous damage and stun an enemy for up to five seconds, making them easy prey for Mirana and her team.<br/>Depending on Mirana's role, Sacred Arrow has differing priorities for maxing out. As it is single-target and only increases in damage as it is leveled up, it can be useful with only a value point when playing in a core role, as it is capable of stunning enemies for up to 5 seconds at all levels. As a support or roamer, maxing it out early allows Mirana to deal lots of damage to enemies in ganks, along with the stun duration.<br/>When using Sacred Arrow to make gank attempts during the laning stage, use terrain cover and directional angles to your advantage. As trees are shrouded in the fog of war, firing from the direction of a treeline gives enemy players less time to see the arrow coming and dodge it. As well, firing the arrow from behind the enemy can give it the element of surprise, as players tend to be focused on the creep wave and their lane opponent(s) and will not expect to be hit with an arrow from the opposite direction.<br/>Be sure to predict the enemy's intentions when casting Sacred Arrow at them. If an enemy player is going to approach a creep to last-hit it, firing Sacred Arrow at that point ahead of time can cause it to land as they approach and stop to last-hit. If an enemy is attempting to juke Mirana or her allies through trees, casting Sacred Arrow at their predicted path can hit them as they attempt to run away. If an opponent is actively trying to avoid the spell, it is possible to outwit them by firing the arrow in an obvious direction rather than trying to predict an obvious juking path that they know that you expect them to use.<br/>Sacred Arrow can be made much easier to land when combined with a leading disable by an ally. Abilities like Nightmare and Disruption can pin an enemy in place long enough for a long-ranged Sacred Arrow to find its mark and disable the target for a further five seconds.<br/>Used as a counter-gank spell, Sacred Arrow has the ability to completely turn teamfights around. If an ally is being chased by multiple enemies, firing a Sacred Arrow down their retreat path can force them to break pursuit, or can stun an enemy and leave them vulnerable for counterattack. The fleeing teammate can help facilitate this by juking through trees and forcing pursuers to follow a predictable path, or turn around and make the enemy stop in a predetermined location to be hit by the arrow.<br/>If Sacred Arrow hits a non-friendly creep that is not an Ancient, it will instantly kill it regardless of level or travel distance. This can be useful for farming during down-time, as the spell can instantly kill the largest creep in a neutral camp or can immediately destroy a siege creep in-lane.<br/>Sacred Arrow provides a large amount of flying vision as it travels. This allows the spell to be used for scouting purposes, firing it along treelines to search out enemies. In particular, it can be useful for scouting out split-pushers who can hide inside trees like Nature's Prophet, Broodmother and Tinker.<br/>Beware that Sacred Arrow is almost worthless at point-blank range, dealing almost no damage and very little stun duration. Unless you need the mini-stun to interrupt a channeling ability, it is better to simply use physical attacks at close range rather than trying to hit the target with an arrow.<h4>Leap</h4>Leap is an instant-cast re-positioning spell that causes Mirana to jump forward in her facing direction, buffing all nearby allies in the originating area with increased movement and attack speed.<br/>Because of its ability to re-position Mirana instantly, Leap is a very strong spell to use for initiations and escape. At least one early value point should be taken no matter what role Mirana is played in.<br/>Combined with Sacred Arrow and Starstorm, Mirana is capable of inflicting large amounts of damage during ganks. Upon successfully hitting a target with a long-range Sacred Arrow, she can quickly Leap in for the kill, putting her within range for a double Starstorm and buffing her attack speed as she uses her physical attacks to finish the hapless target off.<br/>Leap goes down in mana cost and cooldown alongside increasing its speed bonuses and displacement distance as it is leveled up. If mobility is important, maxing Leap out early can give Mirana increased survivability and boost her offensive potential through the attack speed bonus.<br/>Because of its instant cast time, Leap can be used to easily disjoint incoming enemy projectiles as needed, instead of simply re-positioning her and boosting her mobility. As well, it is capable of displacing Mirana over terrain, allowing her to jump over cliffs and through trees in order to evade pursuers.<br/>When using Leap as an escape ability, it can help to cast it as early as possible. As Mirana herself is also empowered by the movement and attack speed bonus, jumping to safety early on can boost her movement speed immediately and allow her to quickly speed away from enemy pursuers. The movement speed bonus also empowers nearby allies, allowing them to clear the area more quickly as well.<br/>Never discount the speed bonuses that Leap gives nearby allies upon cast. Buffing teammates' attack and movement speed can give them an edge in battle, allowing them to more quickly position themselves to cast spells, chase down fleeing enemies, and use their physical attacks to great effect. When initiating a teamfight, it may be useful to cast Leap to empower your team at the start of the engagement.<br/>Beware that unlike most other forms of self-displacement, Leap is unable to free Mirana from Pounce. If there is a Slark on the enemy team, be extremely mindful of his positioning and be prepared to build a Black King Bar, as Mirana is otherwise extremely vulnerable to being preyed on by him.<h4>Moonlight Shadow</h4>Moonlight Shadow globally places a buff on all allied heroes, causing them to fade into invisibility for as long as they do not attack, cast spells or use items for the duration of the buff.<br/>Moonlight Shadow is an extremely strong ganking spell, as it can act as a pseudo Smoke of Deceit to give Mirana's team a strong initiating advantage.<br/>Used as an escape ability, Moonlight Shadow is able to provide invisibility not only to Mirana, but also to teammates no matter where they are. The spell can be used to globally save teammates from enemy ganks so long as they don't have detection.<br/>Beware that when casting Moonlight Shadow to gank, all allies who are within enemy vision will be marked by the moon symbol, allowing enemies to see that the spell is active during the initial fade time. This can give away that a gank is afoot, allowing the enemy to retreat or even set up a counter-gank.<br/>Be sure not to be too complacent when casting Moonlight Shadow, as it is still possible for enemies to use detection and spot out Mirana and her allies. This can be particularly dangerous if Mirana and her team are grouped too closely together while ganking, as enemies can cast area disables to great effect.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Monkey King is a trickster hero who jumps from treetop to treetop, scouting out his opponents from above, waiting for the opportunity to crash down on them with Primal Spring. With his magic extending staff, he smashes distant foes with Boundless Strikes, each blow charging his weapon through Jingu Mastery. Prone to Mischief, the Monkey King disguises himself as trees and everyday objects, allowing him to ambush enemies, or deceive them for a quick getaway.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tricky and elusive.<br/>Very mobile.<br/>Reliable damage.<br/>Long melee attack range.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly dependent on trees.<br/>Suffers long stun if he falls from a tree.<br/>Vulnerable to stuns.<br/>Requires consecutive hits to benefit from passive bonus.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Unlike most melee heroes, Monkey King has an attack range of 300, allowing him to attack other melee opponents without fear of retaliation.<br/>Take advantage of Monkey King's ability to hop from tree to tree to retreat into the treeline around the edges of the map whenever he is threatened.<br/>Due to Monkey King's ultimate being unaffected by attack speed and Boundless Strike relying solely on raw damage values, players would have go for raw damage and agility in order to maximise these skills. Take note not to forgo attack speed completely, as attack speed helps with Jingu Mastery and his basic attacks.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Boundless Strike</h4>Boundless Strike's damage depends entirely on Monkey King's basic damage, so building up high damage and agility items will tremendously increase its damage output.
<br/>Boundless Strike's critical multiplier is not significant until later in the game, when Monkey King has more damage.<br/>Boundless Strike's damage output is augmented by the damage bonus from Jingu Mastery. Use Boundless Strike when Jingu Mastery stacks are available to deal high damage in the early game.<br/>Boundless Strike is affected by Jingu Mastery and will apply a counter stack and expend a charge as if it were performed by a basic attack.
<br/>Each hero caught by its reach will have a counter stack applied onto them.<br/>Boundless Strike will always expend a single charge, regardless of how many enemies are hit or if it misses entirely. Try to maximise the potential of each charge by hitting clumps of opponents at once.<br/>Boundless Strike will only trigger off of one hero's counter if the resulting strike hits multiple heroes with a counter stack of 3.<br/>Because of its long cooldown, Boundless Strike should be used carefully.<br/>Levels in Boundless Strike increases the stun duration by 0.4 seconds and critical multiplier by 20% per point. It may be wise to invest just a single point in Boundless Strike during the early stages of the game for the purpose of interrupting abilities, if your team has other heroes with disables.<br/>Use Boundless Strike to hit enemies through trees, high ground, and other obstacles.<br/>Use Boundless Strike after jumping on an enemy with Primal Spring to deal burst damage.
<br/>In some circumstances, Boundless Strike should be saved to disable or interrupt targets after they have used a disable or escape ability.
<br/>For example, Boundless Strike should be saved to interrupt Pugna after he starts channeling Life Drain.<br/>Boundless Strike has a fairly quick animation and impact time. Monkey King can turn around and land a Boundless Strike to momentarily stun his opponents, even when retreating with low health.<h4>Tree Dance</h4>Tree Dance has no mana cost as well as a very low cooldown. Use this ability to bypass cliffs and transverse across the map quickly.
<br/>While perched upon a tree, the Move command is linked to the Tree Dance ability, and functions exactly as Tree Dance does.<br/>Tree Dance is placed on cooldown whenever Monkey King takes player-based damage, similar to the mechanics of , making it near impossible to use as an escape mechanism once Monkey King is engaged in combat.
<br/>Use Primal Spring to dislodge yourself from a tree if you are being attacked by an opponent.<br/>Monkey King is disarmed while perched, but he is able to use items and his skills without restriction.
<br/>Boundless Strike and Mischief can be used while on a tree without causing Monkey King to jump off.<br/>Items like Force Staff or Hurricane Pike, Blink Dagger and Eul's Scepter of Divinity will force Monkey King to descend from his tree.<br/>Take the opportunity to place Observer Wards in unorthodox and hard-to-reach places that can't normally be accessible by other heroes.<br/>While perched in a tree, activating Tree Dance again will highlight nearby trees that are within range of being perched from your current tree with a soft aura.<br/>Monkey King is masked in the Fog of War while he is perched in a tree. Enemies require flying or unobstructed vision in order to target Monkey King while he is perched.
<br/>However, when Monkey King jumps from one tree to another, he can be seen and targeted as if he were on the ground.<br/>Be wary of opponents with items and abilities that can destroy trees, such as Lina and Timbersaw. If Monkey King is perched on top of a tree while it is destroyed, he will be stunned for 4 seconds, which would almost guarantee your demise.<h4>Primal Spring</h4>This ability cannot be canceled by Monkey King. If the channeling is stopped by Monkey King, he will still cast the ability for a reduced amount of damage and slow.<br/>Be wary that Primal Spring produces a sound effect while charging up, which can be heard by allies and opponents alike. A cunning opponent may be able to guess your location and may avoid the general area or even try to cut down your tree and turn the tables on you.<br/>Use Primal Spring as an emergency escape ability if Monkey King is being attacked, as Tree Dance will be placed on cooldown if he takes any damage from other heroes.<br/>Primal Spring can be used immediately after a Tree Dance jump. Using these 2 skills consecutively makes for a very good gap closer with a max total of 2000 range.<br/>Unlike most abilities, Primal Spring does not have a visual indicator to denote the maximum cast range and instead locks and prevents the targeting reticle of the ability from exiting its maximum cast range.<h4>Jingu Mastery</h4>Monkey King can apply a counter stack to each opponent through the use of Boundless Strike.
<br/>Each hero struck by Boundless Strike will have a counter stack applied onto them.<br/>Boundless Strike will always expend a single charge, regardless of how many enemies are hit or if it misses entirely. Try to maximise the potential of each charge by hitting clumps of opponents at once.<br/>Boundless Strike will only trigger off of one hero's counter if the resulting strike hits multiple heroes with a counter stack of 3.<br/>Charges of Jingu Mastery are dispellable. Keep a look out for enemies with the ability to do so.
<br/>If you believe that your opponents are going to purge or dispel you, use up your charges on nearby enemy or neutral creeps. Even if you are not dealing direct damage to your opponents, you will be able to recover a considerable amount of health from using your charges<br/>Jingu Mastery charges are lost if Monkey King dies. This applies even if he is holding onto the  and reincarnates.
<br/>Depending on the circumstances, you can take the risk and fight and expend your charges in the hopes of recovering enough health. You may even be able to turn the tables on your pursuer.<br/>Jingu Mastery charges are only granted after four successful hits on the same opponent. Try to stick to the same target in order to ensure you gain your charges as quickly as possible.
<br/>However, do not be too aggressive and reckless in pursuing an enemy for the purpose of activating Jingu Mastery, as you may end up exposing yourself to greater threat.<br/>Alternatively, you can consider spreading out your attacks on multiple opponents, and quickly regain new charges once you fully expend your current load.<br/>Jingu Mastery does not acquire new charges nor does it apply a counter on opponents when there are charges remaining on Monkey King.<br/>Illusions do not benefit from Jingu Mastery, and as such, they do not apply or add on to a counter.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Morphling is a carry hero who switches between damage dealer and resilient survivor. With an Ethereal Blade, Morphling can deal extremely high burst damage, often taking out an enemy instantly. However, he suffers from item and level dependency, as well as a low mana pool and low movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can easily switch between dealing a ton of damage or having a high HP pool.<br/>Can one shot most heroes in the game with Ethereal Blade.<br/>Has an escape ability with a huge range..<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Short attack range.<br/>Low mana.<br/>One of the slowest heroes in the game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Early on, go mid or have a support keep you safe in the safe lane while you farm.<br/>Focus on farming up items. Only go for kills if you know you can get it.<br/>Morphling functions better as a carry in teams with a strong front line. This allows him to remain in the fight with a high amount of agility and hence right click or Adaptive Strike damage, without feeling the pressure of being focused. Although he is good at soaking damage through Morph Strength and items such as Linken's Sphere and Eye of Skadi, he is much more useful as your team's primary source of consistent damage.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Waveform</h4>Use this to escape from ganks early game. If going for kills, use this after using Adaptive Strike if you have that leveled.<br/>Assuming you have the regen and the mana pool, you can use waveform to speed up farming while going for those big items.<br/>Morphling's early game damage is relatively high with Waveform and decent right click through Morph. Consider laning with an aggressive support to grab some early game kills so you can accelerate your farm and reach your late game faster.<h4>Adaptive Strike</h4>As Adaptive Strike scales with attributes, it should not be leveled until after Waveform is maxed and should be the last ability maxed out.<br/>When wanting to maximize the damage, shift to full damage. If needing to escape, use it after you shift to mostly strength.<br/>This is your primary damage spell after you finish Ethereal Blade<br/>You do not need to go full agility or strength. Only 50% agility over strength is needed, and vice versa<h4>Morph</h4>As Morph gives +3 to both Agility and Strength with one level, it is a very strong ability to get at level 1.<br/>Know when to switch between agility and strength. During the laning stage, put more into agility but keep enough in strength so if you get ganked you'll have enough HP to survive. When farming creeps, feel free to put more into agility, and when escaping fights put more into strength.<br/>If you are low on life and being chased/targeted, use Morph to increase your health and health regeneration to increase the difficulty of killing you. Note the moderate mana cost with this ability on.<br/>Agility will increase damage, attack speed, and armor which increases EHP vs physical opponents. Strength, but more HP increases your EHP vs spells.<br/>When lower strength, you also lose 20 for your current HP Pool each time the strength lowers. This cannot deny yourself.<br/>Since Morph has a toggle ability, it will continue to function even while silenced; provided the ability was toggled on prior to being silenced.<br/>When going back to base consider morphing some agility into strength in case of enemies with global abilities such as Zeus and Ancient Apparition or even Clockwerk and Nature's Prophet.<h4>Replicate</h4>Use this on carries who build a lot of stat items to increase the effectiveness of them.<br/>Alternatively use this on squishy supports and try to bait heroes into attacking it so you can Morph Replicate in and get an easy kill. Make sure the area around it is safe first.<br/>If using it on carries, enable control for them so they can control the illusion themselves to help with whatever they're doing.<br/>Sometimes deciding which hero to choose for Replicate can be difficult, however potential candidates for this spell include: a hero with high DPS, those with favorable passives (such as Axe's Counter Helix), squishy support heroes that can be used for bait, tanky heroes (Replicates only take 100% damage), or even an enemy hero that has a Radiance or some other aura, which allows you to take advantage of receiving its effects for free.<br/>Unlike most illusions in the game, the illusion created by Replicate does not take bonus damage, making it difficult to distinguish from an actual hero. You can use this to your advantage by replicating a high-priority ally and using the illusion to bait out enemy spells.<br/>Remember there are a handful of abilities that are able to kill illusions instantly, easily wasting Replicate and Hybrid. Such abilities include Life Drain, Mana Drain and Hex.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Naga Siren is a versatile hero who can appear to be a team's hard carry while actually being just a support. As a support, you can pin down an enemy with your bkb-piercing Ensnare, reduce his armor with Rip Tide and hit him without putting yourself in danger with Mirror Image. And you have a fearsome teamfight ultimate with your dreamy Song of the Siren which will put your enemies to sleep. As a carry however, you will use your images and Rip Tide to farm the jungle and push the lanes, and your Song as a get-out-of-jail-free card, eventually crushing the enemy's base under the ocean's pressure.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Role versatility.<br/>Good at split-pushing and wave cutting.<br/>Ultimate allows team to reset fights.<br/>Good carrier for Gem of True Sight.<br/>Low cooldown root that pierces spell immunity.<br/>Probably the fastest farmer in the game once you've acquired a Radiance.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Somewhat farm dependent even if played as a support.<br/>Extremely farm dependent if played as a carry.<br/>Easy to misuse ultimate with poor communication.<br/>Requires some basic micro-management skills.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>A very strong combination on Naga Siren is Linken's Sphere and Boots of Travel. This makes Naga an incredibly versatile pusher, and Linkens makes it nigh impossible to catch her off-guard while pushing, allowing for an easy Song of Siren escape. Another item worth mentioning is Radiance. Slithice's illusions carry the Radiance aura, allowing farming over large areas and greater combat presence.<br/>Naga Siren can push with impunity; Rip Tide can affect entire creep waves, Mirror Image's illusions can deal tremendous damage to towers, and Song of the Siren makes it very difficult for the enemy team to gank her even if overextended.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Mirror Image</h4>Mirror Image's period of invulnerability is very short, but can allow Naga Siren to dodge many spells. Some easier examples (due to slow projectile speed) include Sven's Storm Hammer and Necrophos's Death Pulse.<br/>Note that none of the auras from Vladmir's Offering will affect illusions from Mirror Image, but they will carry it for the rest of your team, or to help creeps.<br/>Combined with Rip Tide and items, the illusions generated by Mirror Image can greatly enhance Naga Sirens's farm, allowing her to take two camps at once during the early game, and eventually three to four from mid to late game.<br/>Mirror image has a lengthy 40-second cooldown (down to 30 with Octarine Core). When trying to defend against numerous opponents, do not waste your illusions by sending them all at once. Instead, send them one by one, and perhaps try to have one get around the enemy heroes to block and destroy the next incoming creep wave.<h4>Ensnare</h4> It is important to keep Ensnare's unique properties in mind. Its major downside is that Ensnare only prevents movement, and does not stop enemies from fighting back with attacks and spells.
<br/>Ensnare can be applied to targets with Spell Immunity, most notably holders of Black King Bar.<br/>Ensnare will interrupt channeling abilities such as Witch Doctor's Death Ward.<br/>Heroes with invisibility such as Bounty Hunter, Riki and Weaver should be prime targets of Ensnare, as they will be revealed for its duration.<br/>Ensnare will also prevent the usage of teleportation such as Anti-Mage's Blink.<br/>Ensnare can also be used to snare the Animal Courier, preventing it from moving allowing for an easy kill.<h4>Rip Tide</h4>Rip Tide's damage and armor reduction mean that Naga Siren can hit hard even in the early game, and is more than viable to level first. Even when fully leveled, the magic damage it deals is mediocre. Its most important attribute is ultimately armor reduction, which can multiply the physical damage that is dealt by you, your team, and your illusions<br/>Rip Tide will affect targets around Naga's Mirror Images and other illusions. Illusions can be used to engage for Naga, due to their expendable nature.<br/> Once you're farming creep waves with the Radiance burn, you can secure a couple of extra last hits using the nuke damage from Rip Tide rather than relying on the burn.
<br/>However, this will ultimately make you push slower since your allied creeps won't benefit from the armor reduction on the enemies.<h4>Song of the Siren</h4>Song of the Siren is often used to make another initiator's job much easier, as it gives them time to position themselves while your targets are stunned.<br/>It is possible for you to rudely interrupt your teammates' momentum when using this ability for your own sake. Avoid using it as an extra team-fight disable when your teammates already have the upper hand disabling the enemy, as it wastes their abilities by completely making their targets invulnerable. Opt for using Ensnare as a disable instead.<br/>When a crucial escape is necessary (i.e. when losing a team fight), use this ability to impede your pursuers. Any opposing target who approaches you will be stopped in their tracks, making for a smoother exit.<br/>In a bad situation, You can use a Town Portal Scroll during Song of the Siren, or you walk away for a smooth escape.<br/>The interaction between Song of the Siren and an opposing Black King Bar is important. BKB can help enemies avoid being locked down by Song, but it may also make that enemy vulnerable in a teamfight by allowing Naga's team to focus on one target without backup, especially when combined with Ensnare. Enemies should try to activate their BKBs together or take special care in their positioning to reduce this danger.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Nyx Assassin is a powerful roamer whose burst damage nukes allows him to quickly kill any lone heroes he encounters. While his spells provide relatively little teamfight contribution outside of Impale, his ability to kill the enemy one by one can put the enemy team at a disadvantage in terms of economy, creating opportunities for his team to take advantageous teamfights or outfarm the opposition. However, Nyx Assassin's abilities fall off in the late game, where he plays a more supporting role with his stuns.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage.<br/>Reflects damage.<br/>Can give a big space advantage to his team by ganking the enemy team in the early to mid game.<br/>High health regeneration.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Less effective in the late game.<br/>Low mana.<br/>More information needed.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Despite his mediocre attribute growth, Nyx Assassin is a deceptively durable hero, as he can take advantage of damage block items in-lane due to being a melee hero and possesses higher-than-average base HP regen. As well, his Spiked Carapace ability allows him to shrug off extremely powerful damage nukes that could kill other heroes.<br/>Because of his skill set, Nyx Assassin prioritizes in building items that increase the size of his mana pool and provide mana replenishment. His ability to roam autonomously and kill with his high burst alpha means that he can do more for his team if he does not have to return to base frequently to refill his HP and mana. As well, items that improve his mobility, nuking and disabling power will better allow him to find, chase down and kill important targets.<br/>Beware that while Nyx Assassin's spells have respectable cast ranges, his 0.4 second cast animation means that they can be telegraphed and anticipated by the enemy, allowing them to counter the spells. Surprise is key to getting off Nyx Assassin's spells, as the enemy may be able to otherwise avoid them.<br/> Nyx Assassin is best played as a roamer or a solo off-laner in order to maximize his effectiveness.
<br/>As an off-laner, Nyx Assassin can take advantage of his innately high base HP regen to survive enemy harassment, and has Spiked Carapace at his disposal to deflect enemy magic nukes back at their caster. By taking advantage of solo experience and possibly gold if he can manipulate creep equilibrium to favor him, Nyx Assassin can get an early level 6 to begin roaming and getting kills with Vendetta.<br/>As a roamer, Nyx Assassin focuses on taking advantage of his respectable base movement speed and the long cast range of Impale to set up kills for his team in their lanes. Getting important pick-offs during the laning stage can get him the gold and levels he needs to further roam in the mid-game, and can set back the enemy's level and item progression considerably, making them easier targets to kill.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Impale</h4>Impale is a ground-targeted disable that stuns and damages enemies in a line in front of Nyx Assassin.<br/>As Nyx Assassin's primary disable, Impale should be maxed out first, as both its damage and stun duration scale as it is leveled up. Its long cast range allows Nyx Assassin to stun enemies from a surprising range.<br/>The area nature of Impale means that it is possible to damage and stun multiple enemy heroes with a single cast. This can be very useful both for initiating engagements by stunning multiple enemy heroes at the start, or for saving fleeing teammates by stopping pursuers in their tracks.<br/>Great skill is required in order to successfully land Impale, as Nyx Assassin's long cast animation, the unreliable ground-targeted nature of the spell, and the travel time of the spell itself can give enemies almost a full second to react if they are far enough away. If a leading stun is not available, good aiming and prediction skills are needed in order to ensure that Impale will successfully stun its intended target.<br/>Impale will still animate if it catches an invisible hero; if a spike elevates with no visible enemy units, it means that the spell has hit an invisible enemy. This can be useful for finding fleeing enemy heroes who may have cast invisibility to escape, as detection or follow-up area stuns and nukes can then be employed to finish them off.<br/>Remember that as Impale is not a reliable targeted stun, it cannot be blocked by Linken's Sphere. Use this to your advantage when initiating on enemies that are relying on its protection, casting a more expendable spell or item ability to break it while the target is stunned.<h4>Mana Burn</h4>Mana Burn is a unit-targeted spell that destroys a portion of an enemy hero's mana based on their intelligence, and then deals the same amount as magical damage.<br/>Because the ability scales with the intelligence of the target, Mana Burn is extremely powerful against heroes with high intelligence growth but low strength such as Skywrath Mage, Pugna and so on. Targeting low-health intelligence supports can allow Nyx Assassin to quickly remove them from the field before they are able to participate in an engagement.<br/>The damage scaling and cooldown reduction on Mana Burn makes it a good spell to max out early in a match. However, its flat mana cost also prevents Nyx Assassin from utilizing the spell more than a few times in the early game, until he increases the size of his mana pool to accommodate.<br/>Even if it is not used to score a kill, Mana Burn can greatly hinder enemies' attempts to participate in teamfights. If enemies are unable to cast their full spell combo, or cast spells at all, they become worthless in teamfights, only able to auto-attack and possibly not even be able to use item abilities. This makes Mana Burn a powerful ability even against heroes who can withstand the damage nuke, as a Venomancer with no mana may be unable to afford the mana cost of Poison Nova alongside his other spells, a Phantom Assassin will be unable to use Phantom Strike to chase or escape, Wraith King will be unable to rely on Reincarnation, and so on.<br/>Remember that Mana Burn will only deal its damage based on the amount of mana removed, meaning that it becomes worthless against targets that have already had their mana pools depleted. If an enemy has been completely drained of mana, it is best to use other damage nukes to finish them off.<h4>Spiked Carapace</h4>Spiked Carapace allows Nyx Assassin to reflect hero damage back to its origin, stunning the attacker while leaving Nyx Assassin unharmed. It can only reflect the first instance per damage source, and only once per cast of Spiked Carapace.<br/>Because it always lasts for the full 2.25 seconds, and is only useful if the enemy attempts to attack Nyx Assassin, Spiked Carapace should be given low priority for maxing out among his spells. One value point in the laning stage can give strong survivability, however the reduced cooldown and longer stun duration are not strictly necessary until later in the game.<br/>Spiked Carapace is a very strong escape spell as it can be used to stun enemy initiators, delaying them from landing follow-up stuns. In the event that Nyx Assassin is ganked, casting Spiked Carapace can buy him enough time to escape or land a counter-stun with Impale.<br/>Because it only reflects the first instance of hero damage, Spiked Carapace is strong against burst damage nukes but less effective against damage over time spells. While it can completely reflect large single-instance damage nukes like Assassinate and Laguna Blade, it is far less effective against multiple damage ticks like Dual Breath and Battery Assault.<br/>Spiked Carapace's cooldown only allows it to be cast once at the start of an engagement, leaving it unable to be cast again until during the pursuit phase. As such, casting it at the right moment is crucial, as the long cooldown leaves little room for error.<br/>Spiked Carapace can be used as a follow-up stun after a successful Impale. Activating Spiked Carapace right as the stun from Impale expires gives Nyx Assassin another opportunity to stun the target, as any counter-nukes or disables that deal damage will be reflected and stun the enemy again. This can be particularly useful against intelligence casters, who may try to target powerful nukes on Nyx Assassin that can be reflected in their full to add to Nyx Assassin's alpha.<br/>Keep in mind that Spiked Carapace only reflects the damage portion of any spell damage, and Nyx Assassin is still fully affected by secondary effects; Light Strike Array and Storm Hammer will still stun, Frost Blast and Venomous Gale will still slow, and so on. Spiked Carapace should not generally be treated as an invulnerability spell, as the enemy can still disable Nyx Assassin for enough time until the spell expires.<br/>Against certain enemies, Spiked Carapace can allow Nyx Assassin to turn their skillshots against them while saving his own life. Knowing when the enemy may attempt to cast long-ranged nukes like Powershot, Rocket Flare, Sun Strike, and even Ice Blast can allow Nyx Assassin to use Spiked Carapace to block the damage instance and deflect it back, possibly even getting a kill if the caster is low enough.<br/>Good timing and reflexes are crucial for effectively using Spiked Carapace, as its instant cast time and short duration can make it hard to use. Activating Spiked Carapace too early can warn the enemy not to cast any damage spells at Nyx Assassin until it expires, while activating it too late will cause Nyx Assassin to take the full damage from an incoming nuke and possibly be disabled and unable to cast it. Casting it at the right time can allow Nyx Assassin to fully reflect powerful damage nukes and stun numerous enemies while remaining relatively unharmed.<br/>Remember that all sources of hero damage can be used to proc Spiked Carapace's stun, which allows Nyx Assassin to use the enemy's area nukes against them. For instance, activating Spiked Carapace on top of Firefly, March of the Machines, Scorched Earth and even an active Radiance can stun the enemy even if they are not trying to directly target Nyx Assassin, which allows it to be used to stun enemies chasing a fleeing ally, stop a retreating enemy in their tracks, and even interrupt escape teleports.<h4>Vendetta</h4>Vendetta renders Nyx Assassin instantly invisible, while giving him a movement speed boost and unit-walking. Attacking out of invisibility allows him to deal tremendous physical damage to its target.<br/>Because it deals physical damage, Vendetta is well-suited to hunting down heroes with low health and armor, particularly intelligence supports. Striking out of invisibility, and then following up with Impale and Mana Burn, are often enough to bring most squishy supports into the red instantly, if not outright kill them.<br/>Be extremely careful about using Vendetta to initiate. Smart enemy players will buy detection early on in order to detect incoming ganks, turning Nyx Assassin into a free kill. Try to initiate only on lone enemies if possible, and don't be afraid to back away if something doesn't feel right.<br/>While the physical backstab damage is very powerful, there may be times where it can be necessary to cast Impale from invisibility in order to disable the enemy. As Vendetta's cooldown allows it to be cast tactically, not utilizing the backstab damage is not the worst thing in the world.<br/>In a pinch, Vendetta can be cast as an escape spell, provided that the enemy does not have detection. The instant fade time can disjoint incoming projectiles, while the movement speed boost can allow him to more easily clear the area.<br/>Spiked Carapace can be cast during an active Vendetta without breaking invisibility. If an enemy damage nuke is incoming during Vendetta (a sign that they have detection), activating Spiked Carapace can allow Nyx Assassin to reflect the damage while stunning the enemy, and still have the backstab damage available to use.<br/>Because it does not interrupt channeling, Vendetta can be cast during Town Portal Scroll, allowing Nyx Assassin to emerge invisible at his destination.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Assassin is a carry renowned for her innate chance to deal massive critical damage, often killing enemies with a single swing. She specializes in hunting down vulnerable heroes, slowing them with a Stifling Dagger and leaping past defenses with Phantom Strike. Like other carries, Phantom Assassin needs a decent amount of gold and items to be effective. Because of her complete dependence on landing physical crits, she is susceptible to disables and must rely on a Black King Bar in most teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high burst damage.<br/>Has natural evasion.<br/>Has a cheap, long-range slow with good damage.<br/>Fairly mobile.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on pseudo-random distribution.<br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Highly dependent on Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Be mindful that Phantom Assassin is largely a single-target damage hero with low disable potential, so she is unable to deal with multiple targets simultaneously. Target prioritization is key, as Phantom Assassin must precisely eliminate her foes one at a time and cannot afford to be kited.<br/> Despite possessing extremely low base intelligence and intelligence growth, Phantom Assassin has only two low-cost active abilities, so she rarely runs into mana problems and does not have to go out of her way to increase the size of her mana pool. As well, her small mana pool allows her to benefit disproportionately from burst mana regen, such as , allied  and , letting her focus on building items to increase her damage output and carry potential.
<br/>Beware that this can also be used against Phantom Assassin as well, as destroying her meager mana pool with abilities like Mana Break, EMP and Mana Drain can render her unable to cast her spells or use item active abilities in a teamfight. The same applies to abilities that manipulate her intelligence like Arcane Orb and Intelligence Steal, which also renders her extremely vulnerable to Sanity's Eclipse.<br/>Be mindful that since she relies on two passive abilities for survival and damage output, Phantom Assassin is very vulnerable to break-type abilities, particularly Silver Edge. Removing her ability to evade physical attacks, as well as deal crits, can render her impotent in fights.<br/>As with most other agility carries, Phantom Assassin is very weak against burst Magical and Pure damage. While she gains respectable amounts of armor through her high agility growth and can evade attacks through Blur, her mediocre strength results in a health pool that can be easily shredded by spells. This also includes items such as Blade Mail, which can allow enemies to turn Phantom Assassin's high physical damage output against her.<br/>All of the above make building spell immunity very important on Phantom Assassin. The ability to block mana-destroying abilities, block break debuffs, and ignore magic nukes allows Phantom Assassin to survive long enough to eliminate key enemies during engagements.<br/> As a hard carry, Phantom Assassin is limited in the ways that she can be laned.
<br/>In standard situations, Phantom Assassin is played as a safe lane carry who is safeguarded by at least one support. She spends the laning stage accumulating last-hits and surviving enemy harass, trying to farm the items she needs to begin operating independently. As she possesses a slow and nuke in Stifling Dagger and a chasing/escaping spell in Phantom Strike, Mortred is capable of assisting her lanemates in setting up and getting kills on the enemy off-laner, and can dodge ganks fairly reliably if given an opportunity to cast Phantom Strike.<br/>Depending on the lane opponent, Phantom Assassin can be played as a solo mid. While she lacks base damage and can be easy to harass when approaching for last-hits, Stifling Dagger allows her to safely get last-hits at range and harass the enemy constantly. Both Stifling Dagger and Phantom Strike can be used as disabling and initiating spells when allied supports rotate mid for ganks, and the solo experience and gold can allow Phantom Assassin to start being effective earlier on.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Stifling Dagger</h4>Stifling Dagger is a multi-purpose spell that gives Phantom Assassin the ability to deal damage outside of melee range. It is a good ability to consider maxing out first, as its slow duration and damage scale up while its mana cost goes down.<br/>In general, Stifling Dagger is a good ability to get last-hits with, as its extremely long cast range lets Phantom Assassin kill enemy creeps outside of harass range. It can also be used in turn to harass lane opponents and wear down their health over time, though beware of enemies purchasing Magic Stick to counteract this in-lane.<br/>Stifling Dagger's long cast range allows Phantom Assassin to damage enemies at ranges where they may think that they are safe. Among its uses are to cancel enemy regeneration, such as from Healing Salve and Clarity, which can give Phantom Assassin a laning advantage.<br/>Used as a disable, Phantom Assassin can cast Stifling Dagger to greatly slow enemies to prevent them from easily escaping, allowing her and her allies to kill them more easily. As well, it can be used to cover a teammate's escape, slowing a pursuing enemy so that they cannot get within range to attack or cast disables.<br/>Stifling Dagger deals a regular attack by Phantom Assassin on its target, which can inflict attack modifiers and proc chance-based modifiers at range. This allows Phantom Assassin to take greater advantage of Unique Attack Modifiers than most other carries, as she can utilize these modifiers at long range against a variety of opponents.<br/>Stifling Dagger can also be used as a way to disable enemies from afar due to on-hit effects of some items like Skull Basher and Monkey King Bar. With items like these, Phantom Assassin can disable channeling spells and Town Portal Scrolls without even being in melee range.<h4>Phantom Strike</h4>Phantom Strike is a pseudo-blink ability that teleports Phantom Assassin to the target unit, boosting her attack speed when attacking a targeted enemy.<br/>Leveling up Phantom Strike reduces its cooldown, increasing Phantom Assassin's mobility, both for chasing and escaping. Reducing the cooldown allows Phantom Assassin to continually stick to fleeing enemies and pursue them over great distances if needed.<br/>As Phantom Strike can be targeted on both allies and enemies alike, it can be cast as an escape spell to get away from pursuing enemies. To this end, also keep in mind that allies do not have to be at the same elevation as Phantom Assassin, so it can be used to scale cliffs and transit trees to put terrain between Mortred and her pursuers.<br/>Given its low mana cost and cooldown, Phantom Strike can be useful for boosting Phantom Assassin's attack speed when farming creeps, particularly neutral camps. However, keep in mind that the attack speed bonus only applies so long as she is attacking the target of the Phantom Strike, so use it only when it is necessary to focus down a creep over repeated attacks.<br/>When used to jump on top of enemy heroes, try to combine Phantom Strike with a leading Stifling Dagger. Stifling Dagger deals small initial damage, slows and provides vision over the target, allowing Phantom Assassin to get within range to Phantom Strike, attacking them while they are slowed and preventing them from easily kiting her. If time and range permits, try to close in to Phantom Strike range first, and jump onto the target right as Stifling Dagger connects in order to maximize the number of attacks made on the slowed enemy.<br/>Be very careful about which targets are chosen for Phantom Strike, and be wary about over-committing. Phantom Assassin's tremendous damage output makes it tempting to jump onto any potential target, but beware that enemies can bait her into a disadvantageous position far from allied support. As well, certain enemies with point-blank disables such as Slithereen Crush and Berserker's Call can instantly stun Mortred when she jumps on top of them, and supports with a Ghost Scepter can simply become ethereal to become immune to her attacks.<br/>Combined with Helm of the Dominator, Phantom Strike can always ensure that Phantom Assassin has an escape route. Positioning a dominated creep in an area of safety while farming can allow her to instantly jump away if enemies attempt to gank her, and the creep can also be used to scout for vision as needed.<br/>Be mindful that Phantom Strike does not disjoint incoming enemy projectiles. Simply putting distance between Phantom Assassin and any pursuers may not be enough to ensure safety, as targeted stuns can still follow her, and area disables like Storm Hammer, Fortune's End and Concussive Shot also run the risk of disabling the ally that Phantom Assassin jumps to.<h4>Blur</h4>Blur grants Phantom Assassin evasion against physical attacks, as well as shrouding her from mini-map vision when no enemies are nearby.<br/>A value point in Blur in the laning stage can aid Phantom Assassin's survivability against enemy harass. However, given the strong utility of her other abilities, it is best saved as the last ability to max out.<br/>Beware that smart enemies almost always build Monkey King Bar in order to counter Blur, so do not rely on it for protection against physical attacks in the late game. Regardless, it can still buy Phantom Assassin survivability in the mid game and ensure that enemies have a much harder time trying to kill her before they are able to complete it.<br/>Be mindful that even if the enemy does not build Monkey King Bar, they may have ways to reliably burst down Phantom Assassin without the need to rely on physical attacks. When facing teams with heavy burst nukes, it may be wise not to skill Blur past the value point and take Attribute Bonus instead, to boost Phantom Assassin's health, armor and base damage.<br/>In general, Blur is best used to punish enemies for picking heroes that cannot greatly benefit from purchasing Monkey King Bar. For instance, Phantom Lancer's illusions can only benefit from the True Strike and not from the raw damage and attack speed, while the same applies to Chaos Knight. In other cases, Sven cannot boost the power of God's Strength as it does not provide bonus strength, and Riki cannot buy an agility item to increase the damage of Cloak and Dagger, which can limit their upper effectiveness once they are six-slotted.<br/>Blur's ability to hide Phantom Assassin on the mini-map allows her to push and farm in areas where other carries cannot do so as safely. Unless the enemy is directly checking lanes that they are not present in, they may be unaware that Phantom Assassin is in that area.<br/>The blurring effect allows Phantom Assassin to know when enemies are near her, so long as they are not invisible. If the blur effect around her body and the status icon disappear, it likely means that an enemy hero is nearby, and Phantom Assassin can take action accordingly.<h4>Coup de Grace</h4>Coup de Grace is what allows Phantom Assassin to be such a threatening hard carry, as building agility items can tremendously boost her damage output through increased attack speed for more proc chances and more attack damage for larger crits. Because decisions made during engagements are based on expectations of damage output and survivability, Phantom Assassin can throw off enemies' expectations through sudden and surprise crits, causing them to re-think how they want to engage her team.<br/>When fighting, try to determine which enemy heroes can be quickly eliminated with Coup de Grace, and take them out of the picture before they can take part in the fight. Phantom Assassin's ability to deal sudden burst physical damage can allow her to eliminate squishy supports with powerful teamfight items and spells before they know what hit them.<br/>Because it uses pseudo-random distribution, Coup de Grace can be hard to utilize effectively. Failing to proc the ability increases the chances of it proccing for the next attack, so stacking up a few regular attacks before engaging an enemy can increase the chances of landing an opening crit.<br/>Remember that as the same crit chance is applied to Stifling Dagger, Phantom Assassin can potentially use it to deal tremendous damage at range. Mind that its distribution is kept as a separate variable from Phantom Assassin's attacks, so proccing a crit with one does not reduce the chances of proccing a crit with the other.<br/>In general, it is best to build items that grant both attack speed and damage, rather than focusing on one or the other. Phantom Strike can be used to increase the proc chance in a given engagement through increased attack speed, however it cannot be relied on as a steady source of proc chance.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Lancer is an exceptional carry who outnumbers and overwhelms his targets with armies of illusions. With the ability to charge at his opponents, the Phantom Lancer is relatively mobile, and can disappear briefly from the battlefield to confuse or avoid his enemies. Indistinguishable from with his clones, enemies often have a hard time targeting the real Phantom Lancer during fights. However, the Phantom Lancer's illusions can be destroyed by area of effect abilities, rendering him less effective as a result.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Creates confusion with large numbers of illusions.<br/>Excellent disjoint and dispel mechanism with Doppelganger.<br/>Good chase potential with Phantom Rush.<br/>Fast, clean attack animation.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on illusions.<br/>Weak against AoE abilities.<br/>Low health.<br/>No burst damage.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>As with other illusion-dependent heroes, Phantom Lancer should build items that provide stats and passive buffs rather than raw damage or attack speed, because those stats and buffs are transferred to his illusions.<br/>  is the most important item for Phantom Lancer. In the early game, most of his damage against heroes will come from Diffusal Blade's mana burn. 
<br/>A hero with mana will take more damage from Phantom Lancer than one who is out of mana, meaning that Phantom Lancer starts off dealing more damage, and less once the target's mana is drained.<br/>Because of this, Phantom Lancer sometimes has difficulties finishing off tough, retreating enemies like Timbersaw when they are already out of mana.<br/>When fighting heroes with low mana like Sven, Phantom Lancer will do less damage overall because the target's small mana pool is quickly depleted.<br/>Phantom Lancer's illusion army will often overwhelm new to mid-level players, causing them to attack the wrong target and waste their abilities. However, this should not be your primary strategy, because more experienced players are usually able to discover the real Phantom Lancer by observing the amount of damage being dealt (most illusions take more damage), debuff status, as well as player movement patterns.<br/>With enough micromanagement, you can deceive enemies by controlling illusions independently, and moving in ways you might move Phantom Lancer himself.<br/>Moving illusions together in clumps usually tells enemies that they are illusions.<br/> During smaller teamfights, staying inside a big group of illusions can make it harder for enemies to find the real Phantom Lancer. 
<br/>However, this tactic can backfire if enemy nukers target the entire group with AoE abilities. Make sure no nukers are nearby before grouping up.<br/>Remember to move Phantom Lancer himself when manipulating his illusions. A good tactic for newer players is to issue a distant move command for Phantom Lancer, while moving his illusions to trick the pursuing enemies.<br/>Though attack speed is still important on Phantom Lancer, it is not needed as much due to his ability to create attacking illusions.<br/>Get teammates to use buffs and abilities on an illusion to confuse enemies, such as Shallow Grave. This tactic is highly situational.<br/> Illusions are counted as heroes in a target check, but they sometimes receive effects intended for units, letting the enemy tell them apart straight away. 
<br/>For example, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask will stun Phantom Lancer's illusions by 5 seconds, but only stun Phantom Lancer himself for 1 second.<br/>When choosing an item build, remember that not all passive item abilities are shared with illusions.<br/>Read the Illusions article for a full understanding of how illusions work.<br/>Phantom Lancer is a moderately good ganker, but still needs to farm items for the late game. Try to balance the two roles depending on what opportunities are present on the map.<br/>Phantom Lancer has no strong disables, instead relying on speed and slows to catch up to his opponents.<br/>Phantom Lancer is a decent split pusher, especially in the late game. Take advantage of this whenever you aren't fighting.<br/>Phantom Lancer excels in long, drawn-out fights, which give him lots of time to wear down his opponents' mana and spawn more illusions.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Spirit Lance</h4>Spirit Lance is Phantom Lancer's generic nuke. Use it during the early game to supplement his damage during ganks and for harassment.<br/>Use Spirit Lance during the laning phase to intimidate enemy laners, especially vulnerable supports.<br/>Using Spirit Lance to get last hits can be worth it if Phantom Lancer is not farming well.<br/>The illusion spawned from Spirit Lance has the same properties as every other illusion. It will burn the enemy's mana once you have Diffusal Blade, and spawn further illusions with Juxtapose.<br/>Don't hesitate to use Spirit Lance on a squishy support in the back line rather than on the enemy carry you're currently focusing. Once you're farmed enough, it could force the support to back off by itself, or waste his precious AoE disable on the illusion army that gathered up around him.<br/>If Phantom Lancer is too weak to join a fight, use Spirit Lance repeatedly from the edges to send an illusion to help your allies. The illusion could spawn an army of illusions by itself to confuse and mislead enemies, as well as burn their mana.<br/>Spirit Lance's projectile is slow and very visible, and thus easily disjointed. Avoid wasting it on heroes who can dodge the projectile, such as Puck.<br/>Spirit Lance's deceptively long cast range can be used to finish off an enemy during teamfights.<br/>Spirit Lance's short cooldown means it can be used to initiate and finish off fleeing opponents.<br/>Use Spirit Lance on an enemy who is just about to move out of vision, such as up high ground or into the trees. The illusion that spawns next to them will grant vision.<br/>If your illusion is not auto-attacking its target after impact, check your game settings. Do not have the Illusions → Never auto-attack option turned on when playing Phantom Lancer. But, while trying to juke with Doppelganger, you don't want use the Illusions → Always auto-attack option either, as the opponent will immediately spot which is the real hero. Find the compromise.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Doppelganger</h4>Doppelganger's short cast time allows Phantom Lancer to easily dodge Fortune's End.<h4>Phantom Rush</h4>Once Phantom Rush starts, Phantom Lancer will not stop until he either reaches the target, loses vision of the target, gets disabled, or is given a move command.<br/>Be careful not to inadvertently initiate with Phantom Rush, or charge into a bad situation. Cancel the rush with a move command if necessary.<br/>Phantom Rush's extra movement speed makes it a good chasing mechanism against heroes with movement speed buffs, like Surge, Shukuchi, Stampede or even Shapeshift.<br/>Phantom Lancer cannot be slowed during Phantom Rush. Use this to charge to and between enemies in teamfights, picking off supports and dying heroes.<br/>At level 3, Phantom Rush has a longer cast range than Spirit Lance, making it a better initiation tool in some scenarios.<br/>Early levels in Phantom Rush can be useful for a ganking or mid Phantom Lancer.<br/>In some situations, Phantom Rush can be used as an escape tool, if there is an enemy target close enough for you to rush, and is far from the rest of the enemy team.<br/>With Phantom Lancer's level 25 talent, Phantom Rush becomes an extremely long ranged charge, allowing Phantom Lancer to run to any enemy during a teamfight, and chase down fleeing stragglers.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Juxtapose</h4>Like every passive, Juxtapose is disabled by break, such as from Silver Edge. When this happens, Phantom Lancer loses the ability to passively spawn illusions, and becomes very vulnerable to single target abilities like Primal Roar or Doom.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Razor is a fast, tough anti-carry who steals the attack power from his enemies, and transfers it to himself. Armed with a Desolator, he can quickly melt away armor with Eye of the Storm, allowing his team to cut through enemies with ease. However, Razor has no disables, and must rely on staying close to his targets and executing his abilities properly in order to be an effective damage dealer.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Counters carries.<br/>Strong lane presence.<br/>Good starting Strength and Agility.<br/>Fast movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on well-positioned abilities to deal damage.<br/>Loses effectiveness against heroes with higher mobility.<br/>Does not recover well from a bad early game.<br/>No disables.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Razor can be played in all lanes, but is most commonly played in mid. Because of his speed and durability, he is not extremely dependent on supports.<br/>Razor is surprisingly durable compared to many carries, especially in the early to mid game. This advantage falls off in the late game, however, making him a medium carry.<br/>Compared to other carries, Razor's autoattacks deal little damage. In order to hit hard, Razor relies on his Static Link to steal enemy damage, and Eye of the Storm to reduce their armor.<br/>Razor's abilities are dependent on positioning, requiring him to chase and remain close to his targets.<br/>Razor's ability effects and sounds cannot be seen or heard by the enemy when he is invisible, allowing him to deal damage surreptiously with a Shadow Blade or other means of invisibility.<br/>Razor's autoattacks have a small delay after its visual effect before the damage is dealt. Time your animations accordingly.<br/>Razor should be thought of as a hybrid between tankiness and damage, and his item build should reflect whichever his team needs more.<br/>With Unstable Current, Eye of the Storm, and a few defensive items, Razor should aim to dominate the battlefield by placing himself directly in the middle of the fight.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Plasma Field</h4> Try to catch enemies with the edge of Plasma Field's radius, as this will deal maximum damage.
<br/>Consider moving away from the enemy after casting Plasma Field to accomplish this.<br/>Use Plasma Field to harass enemies in lane. Keep in mind that this will also push the lane, however.<br/>Use Plasma Field to pick off invisible enemies, or enemies juking in the trees.<br/>Use Plasma Field across high ground and barriers to intimidate or finish off enemies.<br/>Since Plasma Field's expanding radius follows Razor as he moves, its range is deceptively large, and can be used early while Razor is approaching the target.<br/>Use Plasma Field's wide radius to farm jungle creeps quickly by moving and hitting multiple camps at once.<br/>Plasma Field's large area effect is visible to enemies across any terrain, and can therefore give away your position. Think twice before using it prior to a team gank or during a Roshan attempt.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Static Link</h4> Static Link is often leveled first as a means to zone out a laning opponent, reducing their damage so they cannot get last hits. Conversely, it also helps Razor get last hits by giving him more damage.
<br/>Move close to the target, then use Static Link to drain them for as long as possible. Do not attack the enemy, as this will cause the lane creeps to turn on you, forcing you to retreat without stealing much damage.<br/>Done correctly, this method allows Razor to dominate against a solo lane opponent.<br/>In teamfights, use Static Link on enemy carries as early as possible to transfer their damage to Razor.<br/>Static Link cannot be purged by spell immunity, but cannot be cast on targets that are already spell immune. Use it before the enemy has a chance to activate their Black King Bar.<br/>In teamfights, Static Link is most effective on melee carries, who will lose a good portion of their damage before they have a chance to attack Razor.<br/>Because of its cast animation time, it is better to use Static Link when Razor is relatively close to the target. Using it from the maximum cast range will often allow the target to break the link before Razor can catch up.<br/> During the late game, a good Static Link can make a big difference in teamfights by neutralizing the enemy carry.
<br/>A quickly broken Static Link does not necessary spell defeat, but will cause Razor to do very little damage.<br/>Static Link will stay applied to Brewmaster when using Primal Split, and will continue to sap damage from the Earth elemental.<br/>Blinking heroes like Anti-Mage or Queen of Pain can easily break Static Link. Make sure they are fully engaged in the fight before using it on them.<h4>Unstable Current</h4>The speed increase from a single point in Unstable Current is usually enough until the late game.<br/>Unstable Current has a particle effect whenever Razor is targeted by an ability, even if the enemy hero is far away and not in vision. Keep an eye out for this effect to determine the direction and position of the enemy through the fog of war.<br/>Send Razor out in front to act as a lightning rod for enemy spellcasters. Opponents who target him will be damaged and dispelled.<br/>Unstable Current does not trigger against area of effect abilities, such as Nether Blast.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Eye of the Storm</h4>Eye of the Storm's armor reduction has an compounding effect. The more times enemies are struck, the weaker they become, thus the more likely they are to be struck again.<br/>Eye of the Storm is ineffective when creeps are nearby, as they will absorb many of the lightning strikes.<br/>Razor can cause Eye of the Storm to target an enemy by attacking and bringing that enemy's health low.<br/>Eye of the Storm can deal devastating damage to a single enemy, as long as Razor keeps the target within range. This is an easy way to get an early kill.<br/>Because Eye of the Storm reduces armor, additional armor reducing items like Assault Cuirass and Desolator will let Razor and his team do heavy damage to an affected target.<br/>Remember to move between attacks to keep enemies within Eye of the Storm's range.<br/>Eye of the Storm's long duration means it should always be activated prior to a fight.<br/> With , Eye of the Storm allows Razor to take down buildings fairly quickly. Combined with its short cooldown, it can be used exclusively for pushing lanes.
<br/>Eye of the Storm will not hit filler buildings.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Riki's permanent invisibility is both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. On one hand, it makes him able to surprise enemies and farm with very little concern. On the other hand, without invisibility he has no real defense. He still has to watch out for revealing items such as Dust of Appearance and Gem of True Sight, as well as abilities that prevent him from going invisible. If he stays alive and picks off lone enemies, he can quickly get out of control.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Permanent invisibility.<br/>Can use items without breaking invisibility.<br/>Relatively mobile.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health points.<br/>Low health regeneration<br/>Low mana.<br/>Low base damage<br/>Easily countered by wards and True Sight.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Riki is one of the best support and roamer in the game. The ability to place wards and sentry while invisible makes Riki a viable support hero and also scout area while permanently hidden makes Riki one of the best roamers in the game<br/>Due to recent 6.87 riki is not a viable carry hero in late game as he is out carried by almost all carries in the game. Riki has a carry and support potential thus Riki should be played as a Semi-support.<br/>Riki is exceptional at ganking lone heroes and picking them off one by one. He can snowball easily through just getting lots of kills even without farm. Try to get kills before the enemy starts grouping up, so they cannot punish you with detection items.<br/> Riki is an attribute-based carry, thanks to 's backstab damage. This means that it continues to get stronger and stronger as the game goes on, as long as you continue to farm, gank, and purchase the right items.
<br/>Because of this, Diffusal Blade should be your first core item completed, it gives everything Riki needs: the agility scales well with and the active Purge helps you in many applications, removing strong protections like Repel, Guardian Angel from enemies and purging them while inside of Smoke Screen, which is your main ganking combo. Always use all the charges before buying the recipe again and search to do the best use of them. Be warned however, Diffusal Blade no longer purges dust as it cannot be used on allies.<br/> Do not walk straight up to enemies and deep into enemy territory and expect never to die. If they have any kind of detection (e.g. ), then Riki dies very quickly.
<br/>As a result of this, make a habit of constantly checking the enemy's inventory for revealing items.<br/>Be wary around more durable enemy heroes. Spell Immunity from Black King Bar allows enemies to ignore Smoke Screen and fight Riki, ignoring his backstab damage.<br/>Riki is a key hero to catch slippery foes and heroes that are heavily reliant on their own active skills since he can approach without detection and use smoke to prevent them from using escape spells, so it is wise to pick him as a counter pick to many heroes like Slark, Juggernaut, Anti-Mage, Weaver or Storm Spirit. However, be careful of enemies carrying escape items, like Force Staff, Glimmer Cape, Blink Dagger or Shadow Blade/ Silver Edge.<br/>Always scout the enemy jungle once in a while, you may encounter some enemy farming alone for an easy kill, also help high mobility heroes like Spirit Breaker or Nature's Prophet to set up a gank.<br/>Do not be afraid of enemies carrying Gem of True Sight, track down their movement and wait, sooner or later they are going to end up alone and when this happens do not hesitate, use the fog of war and approach them from the sides, go for the kill and recover the Gem.<br/>Riki requires a lot of map knowledge as some supports or players place sentry wards in obvious position. Knowing heroes who carry dust, knowing the range of the sentry detection and knowing hot spots for sentry placement can increase your overall survivability in the game<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Smoke Screen</h4>Smoke Screen provides a powerful Silence and gives enemies a high miss chance, as well as slowing them down.<br/>If Smoke Screen targeted properly, it can hold an enemy down long enough to finish them off.<br/>A good strategy is to throw a Smoke Screen in the enemy's path, rather than where they are presently.<h4>Blink Strike</h4>Blink Strike can target allies and enemies. Jumping to a friendly unit can be useful in case Riki needs to escape.<br/>Blink Strike is unit targeted, not point targeted, and as such cannot be used unless there are units around.<br/>Blink Strike helps catch up with fleeing enemies, jump into fights quickly, and escape from situations by targeting allies.<br/>Blink Strike pairs well with the backstab damage from Cloak and Dagger, as it teleports Riki behind the enemy.<h4>Cloak and Dagger</h4> If Riki's enemies do not have any form of detection, the invisibility will let Riki escape with ease and roam freely.
<br/>If they do, Riki has to rely on his cunning and speed in order to get the drop on enemies, and get out alive.<br/>You can take Cloak and Dagger as your first skill point and easily take the first Bounty Rune in either side of the river, unless the enemy has any form of detection.<br/>Cloak and Dagger also enables him to deal incredible damage from behind based on a multiplier of his agility.<br/>Since good supports always stay behind, you can flank the enemy team coming around from there and catching the supports as soon as a teamfight begins and the enemy team is so busy fighting yours that they do not realize that their supports are already dead. This strategy also applies to enemy initiators with game-breaking ultimates like Enigma or Magnus, as a good interruption can set victory in critical situations.<br/>A well-organised team will often buy Sentry Ward to keep vision of Riki. You may want to take it upon yourself to de-ward your lane if needs be; if you are without a support, or so that your support can concentrate on other items.<h4>Tricks of the Trade</h4>Tricks of the Trade pairs well with large AoE disables such as Ravage, Reverse Polarity, and Black Hole.<br/>Later in the game, you can use Tricks of the Trade after Blink Strike to initiate, then safely Blink Strike again to escape enemies waiting for you.<br/>Tricks of the Trade may be combined with cleave from Battle Fury or Empower to devastate closely grouped enemies.<br/>Tricks of the Trade turns Riki invulnerable and hidden for a maximum of 5 seconds. Do not be afraid to use the skill to avoid dying from spells such as Assassinate.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Fiend is a ranged carry who collects the soul of every unit he kills, growing stronger with each soul claimed. Because of this, he benefits from a high attack damage potential, but also suffer punishing setbacks if he dies. The Shadow Fiend can also unleash all the souls he has gathered, devastating enemies over a wide area with Requiem of Souls. While highly effective as an offensive hero, Shadow Fiend has no defensive abilities and needs help from teammates to position his abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Gains damage from kills.<br/>Fast farmer.<br/>Good balance of early game magic damage and late game physical damage.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Loses damage upon dying.<br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Requires good positioning.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Shadow Fiend is nearly always played in the mid lane.<br/>Unlike other carries, Shadow Fiend's heavy damage depends on his Necromastery count. This means that dying will make him significantly weaker, especially in the late game.<br/>Shadow Fiend has no movement or escape abilities, making him easily gankable. Make sure there are wards to spot any potential gankers moving to the mid lane.<br/> Survivability is essential for Shadow Fiend early in the game. 
<br/>A Shadow Fiend with few souls will have a hard time regaining footing in the mid game.<br/>Play conservatively and take few risks until he has a decent health pool and soul count.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shadowraze</h4>Shadowraze's low mana cost means it can be used during the laning phase to score last hits and harass the enemy.<br/>Shadowraze's nuke damage is considerable during the early game, and allows Shadow Fiend to gank.<br/>Use Shadowraze early if you're having trouble building souls. A level 1 Shadowraze deals 100 damage, which is much higher than the 35-41 base attack damage you start with.<br/>Multiple Shadowrazes allows Shadow Fiend to clear creep waves very quickly.<br/> Use Shadowraze in early game fights, when it deals more damage than your autoattacks.
<br/>During the late game, Shadow Fiend's autoattacks should deal higher DPS than using Shadowraze.<br/>To land all three Shadowrazes on distant but stationary targets, move forward a little after each Shadowraze. This is particularly effective when engaging targets who are already disabled, or fighting a teammate.<br/>Use Shadowraze to chase melee heroes when they are running in a straight line. Remember it also has a small area of effect.<br/>Use Shadowraze to finish off enemies juking in the trees.<br/> Shadowraze does hit  enemies, giving Shadow Fiend three chances to kill off a dying target. 
<br/>Use it immediately after the enemy goes invisible for increased accuracy.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Necromastery</h4>Necromastery is usually leveled first to help Shadow Fiend start accumulating souls early, which lets him last hit more easily.<br/>Necromastery receives souls from all kills, including denies. This, however, doesn't mean you should prioritize denies over last hits.<br/>Jungle creeps are a safe and easy way to farm up souls with Shadowraze. This is a good way to regain souls during a tough mid lane or after a death.<br/>A good way to deal with his low starting damage is to last hit Clockwerk's Power Cogs, provided he was on your team.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Presence of the Dark Lord</h4>Combined with Necromastery, Presence of the Dark Lord lets Shadow Fiend deal heavy damage with regular autoattacks.<br/>Stay near enemies to keep them under the effect of the armor debuff.<br/>Since armor reduction is negligible during the early game, Presence of the Dark Lord is best leveled during the late game, as Shadow Fiend has a very low basic attack damage without items or points in Necromastery.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Requiem of Souls</h4> Requiem of Souls is one of the most powerful abilities in the game, dealing up to 2160 damage after the standard 25% magic resistance deduction.
<br/>At very close range, Requiem of Souls will kill almost any hero.<br/> Requiem of Souls has a brief charge time, meaning that positioning is extremely important to its proper use.
<br/>Use the invisibility from Shadow Blade to sneak up next to an opponent before using Requiem of Souls.<br/>Wait for teammates to stun, root, or slow enemies before using Requiem of Souls.<br/>Begin charging Requiem of Souls next to a target that is cycloned or hidden by abilities like Astral Imprisonment, unleashing the full damage on them when the disable ends.<br/>Requiem of Souls can be stopped during its channel time with the Stop command (S by default). Use this to cancel a poorly positioned cast, or to bluff and intimidate nearby enemies.<br/>Requiem of Souls is often skipped at level six, as it does little damage without the extra souls gained from higher levels of Necromastery, and can be hard to land without additional items like Shadow Blade or Black King Bar.<br/>When retreating, use Requiem of Souls as a defensive cover for your allies and a deterrent against pursuing enemies.<br/> Teamwork is very helpful when trying to land a good Requiem of Souls. 
<br/>Let an ally such as Earthshaker initiate teamfights before jumping in with Requiem of Souls.<br/>Requiem of Souls doesn't need to be cast in the middle of the enemy team to deal damage, as it can be hard to cast because you might be focused in the middle of a teamfight. So try to use it where it can hit the enemies as the slow and damage reduction debuff is powerful enough to win you the teamfight.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Slark is an extremely slipperly melee carry. Jumping over obstacles, he Pounces on enemies and jumps away to safety, shrouding himself from damage with Shadow Dance. When unseen, Slark's natural regeneration replenishes his health, allowing him to return to the fight time and time again. Slark is susceptible to area disables and magical nukes, and his damage is mostly effective against single targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Numerous escape mechanisms.<br/>Steals enemy attributes.<br/>Large night vision.<br/>Strong pick-off and snowball potential.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Fragile in the early game.<br/>Low attribute growth.<br/>Primarily single target focused.<br/>Has no stuns.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Slark is usually played in the safe lane, with a support. He can also be played in the offlane.<br/>Slark is sometimes played in the mid lane, but may struggle against ranged heroes like Queen of Pain.<br/>Slark's base attributes are average at best, although with enough stolen Agility and damage items he can keep up with hard carries such as Phantom Assassin and Sniper.<br/>Slark is potent ganker in the mid game, and should always be looking for opportunities to pick off an enemy. The enemy jungle is an excellent hunting ground for Slark.<br/>Slark's unusually large night vision radius (1800) means he can see further than most heroes at night. Use this advantage when timing ganks.<br/>Because Slark lacks a stun, enemies will often blink or teleport away when ganked.<br/>Slark differs from most carries in that he takes more of a hit-and-run approach.<br/>Due to the high health regeneration from Shadow Dance, Slark can often return to teamfights after moving out of enemy vision to regain health.<br/>Slark's mana is fairly low in the early game, when his abilities should be used sparingly.<br/>Slark should try to play aggressively once he reaches level six, so he can take full advantage of the agility transfer from Essence Shift.<br/>Use Slark's high mobility and pick off supports before fights break out, allowing his team to start with an advantage.<br/>Slark can stack 2 or even up to 3 camps at a time using his high mobility and pounce.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Dark Pact</h4>Activate Dark Pact before using Pounce or initiating on the enemy. This gives the effect of higher burst damage, and triggers the cooldown earlier.<br/> Dark Pact purges debuffs and disables from Slark, including . This is especially useful for escaping.
<br/>Activate it just before you are about to be disabled by abilities like Storm Hammer or Unstable Concoction. After the projectile hits, Dark Pact will automatically remove the disable.<br/>The multiple hits from Dark Pact is useful against protection abilities with a limited number of charges, such as Refraction, Gravekeeper's Cloak, or Living Armor.<br/>Dark Pact is a great way to finish off an invisible unit that has been leashed, as the AoE damage affects invisible targets.<br/>Dark Pact is a great way to accelerate farm between gank attempts. When combined with Power Treads' ability to toggle stats, the cost of the ability can be minimized.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Pounce</h4>One point of Pounce is usually leveled first in case Slark needs to escape a bad situation.<br/>When determining the direction to Pounce in, make sure Slark has fully turned towards that direction before using Pounce.<br/>Use Pounce over elevations and barriers to escape pursuers.<br/>Pounce will hit invisible heroes. Use it immediately after an adjacent enemy goes invisible to ensure a hit. If a leash is established, follow up with Dark pact.<br/>Heroes with blinking abilities will be able to break out of Pounce's leash.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Essence Shift</h4>Maximize Essence Shift's duration by continually harassing and retreating. Go for the kill once you think you have enough damage and attack speed to take down enemy heroes.<br/>Maximize Essence Shift's efficiency by taking objectives using his stolen attributes. After a large teamfight, it is not uncommon to find that Slark has stolen upwards of 50 agility, making quick work of untended towers or Roshan.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Shadow Dance</h4> In general, Shadow Dance should be activated when Slark is at low health, not at the beginning of fights.
<br/>However, in some cases, Shadow Dance is best used even at high or full health to prevent targetable skills such as Tinker's Laser which could make your attacks miss, Doom's Doom, Phantom Assassin spells and many more, because once Shadow Dance is activated Slark is untargetable.<br/>During the laning phase, regain your health by simply retreating out of enemy vision once Slark is level six.<br/>When being chased, try to get out of sight from the enemy, be it around trees, up high ground, or behind barriers. The passive from Shadow Dance will activate when out of enemy sight and give you a boost to move speed and HP regen for a short moment before sight is regained. This can be the difference between life and death.<br/> Shadow Dance's passive can be used as an indirect way of detection. If you find that Slark has suddenly lose his movement speed and regeneration, it means the enemy has vision over you.
<br/>This indicates that there is a source of enemy vision nearby, such as an Observer Ward, a Hawk, or an invisible enemy.<br/>Keep an eye on Shadow Dance's buff icon to know whether or not the enemy has vision nearby.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sniper is a very long ranged carry, designed to decimate enemies from the backline. He is able to scout ahead with his Shrapnel, and pick off targets from extreme distances with Assassinate. In the late game, a well-farmed Sniper can destroy almost any enemy before they have a chance to get close or do much in a teamfight. However, Sniper is also one of the most defenseless heroes in the game, and can be easily killed if caught alone.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high attack range.<br/>High single target damage.<br/>Excellent harassment abilities.<br/>Easy for beginners.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No escape mechanism.<br/>Low mobility.<br/>Fragile and easily ganked.<br/>Requires a good early game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Stutter stepping between attack animations allows Sniper to land more hits on a moving target.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shrapnel</h4>Shrapnel is mostly a utility ability, but one should not underestimate the damage it can do in a teamfight.<br/>Shrapnel gives . Use it as a scouting ability, such as over high ground or the .
<br/>Shrapnel over trees is useful for finding juking enemies.<br/>Shrapnel over choke points is useful for revealing enemies before they get too close.<br/>Shrapnel can reveal a distant fleeing enemy and allow Sniper to lock onto him with Assassinate.<br/>Use Shrapnel in front of Sniper when running away in order to slow the pursuing enemy.<br/>Use Shrapnel in front of the enemy to slow them down while chasing.<br/>Use Shrapnel on top of Sniper when fighting a melee ganker in order to deal as much damage as possible.<br/>Use Shrapnel in combination with a teammate's AoE ability, such as Enigma's Black Hole.<br/>Use Shrapnel over friendly buildings to deter enemies from attacking them.<br/>Use Shrapnel over a group of fighting creeps before retreating to gain a bit of extra gold.<h4>Headshot</h4>Headshot is good for harassing enemies in lane, especially against melee heroes.<br/>Use the slow from Headshot to stutter step closer to the enemy.<br/>When chasing an enemy with your team, landing a single Headshot may be enough to slow the target down sufficiently. 
<br/>This means that Sniper can stop and take a chance on a single attack if it appears that he will not be able to catch up over a long distance.<h4>Take Aim</h4>One level of Take Aim is typically enough for the laning phase since it allows Sniper to outrange almost all enemies.<br/>If Sniper is taking heavy harassment, or playing in the dangerous solo lane, invest more points in Take Aim in order to score last hits.<br/>Take Aim will also allow Sniper to harass enemy laners, but his focus should be primarily on farming.<br/>With level 2 or higher, Sniper will outrange towers, allowing him to attack them without being hit.<br/>With his long range, it can be tempting to instantly attack the enemy initiator in teamfights, but it is nearly always better to retrain Sniper's attacks on a carry or backline support.<br/>Take Aim gives Sniper the luxury of easily switching targets in teamfights. Analyze situations with a cool head and use this to your advantage.<h4>Assassinate</h4>Shrapnel gives vision through the fog of war, allowing Sniper to lock onto distant enemies with Assassinate.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Spectre is a hard carry who can dominate the late game if she gets the necessary farm. Her Desolate ability lets her take on solo opponents with the upper hand, and Dispersion makes her a tanky foe who deals damage by reflecting incoming attacks. However, her early game is one of the worst in the game, being squishy and her only escape using up a lot of her mana pool. Get past this, however, and Spectre will be a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global map presence.<br/>Extremely strong late game.<br/>Can gank well early game.<br/>Fairly tanky carry.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low early game health and mana.<br/>Farms really slow without Radiance.<br/>Item dependent.<br/>Low agility gain for an agility hero.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Spectre has a terrible early game, and it's likely that enemies will try to take advantage of this. Make sure you always have enough mana for Spectral Dagger while laning so you can escape from enemies who are trying to kill you.<br/>Spectre has a weak lane presence. Picking her requires a team that will largely be able to support her in the laning phase.<br/>One of Spectre's biggest strengths as a carry is her ability to participate in teamfights and ganks instantly through Haunt without wasting valuable farming time.<br/>Spectre's main focus should be getting Radiance, which makes her significantly more powerful, both at fighting at farming.<br/>Using Manta Style to farm is a common tactic, allowing Spectre to farm areas of the map in which she would be in risk of a gank. Combined with Radiance, Spectre can be a rather effective split pusher.<br/>In late game teamfights, Haunt and Desolate will allow your illusions to wither down support heroes at the back at significant speeds. In addition, you should always be in the middle of team fights to maximize the damage reflection of Dispersion.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Spectral Dagger</h4>It is generally a good idea to level up Spectral Dagger first to provide Spectre with extra mobility so that she is harder to pin down during ganks. However, be wary of its mana cost, as a single Spectral Dagger will typically consume half your mana pool per cast (in the early game).<br/>Early on, always make sure you have enough mana for Spectral Dagger in case you need to make a quick escape.<br/> During fights, instead of aiming at an enemy, aim it at the ground in a way that it'll hit as much enemies as possible. It'll increase the overall DPS it deals.
<br/>However, aim it at fleeing enemies when the fight is ending to make sure they don't escape.<br/>There is a grace period after getting off the dagger where you still have free pathing. Use this to your advantage.<br/>The shadow path left by Spectral Dagger lets her keep track on her prey even if the are invisible or have blinked/teleported. It also slows her target and enemies who came in to the path.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Desolate</h4>Desolate works on creeps, so it makes farming in jungle slightly faster when you can kill that last creep faster. Try to kill the weaker creeps first to maximize the damage bonus.<br/>Similarly, the bonus from Desolate still works if the enemy is near neutral creeps, so engagements in the jungle won't lower your overall damage.<br/>It can be used to check for invisible enemies if you melee a creep who's alone but you don't get the bonus damage. This isn't as reliable as using a Sentry Ward however.<br/>Do not forget that Desolate only works on solitary enemies. Try to chase targets away from allies, causing them to take more damage.<br/>Desolate damage is done before the attack, and cannot miss. While it does not serve as an alternative to Monkey King Bar, do not hesitate to engage evasive enemy heroes who are alone.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Dispersion</h4>Dispersion effectively reduces all damage you take by 22% at max level, meaning it scales really well into the late game.<br/>Dispersion is classed as HP Removal, which means that it won't proc things such as Bristleback, but it also won't cancel items such as Healing Salve<br/>Because the effect lessens with range, heroes with long ranges such as Drow Ranger with a Dragon Lance will take less damage from you than a melee hero would. The amount of damage you take is still fully reduced, however.<br/>Synergies well with both raw HP as well as damage reduction like armor and damage block.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Haunt</h4>The illusions from Haunt carry the same things regular illusions would, which makes Radiance and Diffusal Blade even more effective on Spectre.<br/>Always keep an eye on the minimap to Haunt to teamfights when needed.<br/>Use Haunt to finish off fleeing enemies with low health.<br/>Use Haunt to immediately return to a fight after buying back.<br/>Use Haunt to assist in fights across the map while you farm in the jungle, and to even drop in if you're needed in the fight.<br/>Use Haunt to quickly return to defend your base when the enemy is pushing a lane.<br/>It is sometimes beneficial to leave Haunt at level 1 in the early and mid-game. Your illusions will not be strong enough to significantly benefit from an extra one or two seconds during skirmishes or team fights, and the extra points may be better spent in your other abilities.<br/>Haunt can be used to escape from a bad situation if you're being ganked by 3 or 4 opponents.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Templar Assassin is a highly elusive and devastating hero in the right hands. Her Refraction simultaneously protects her from any damage instance, no matter how low or high, and increases her attack damage output for a few attacks. Combined with the armor reduction of Meld, any enemy hero with small health pools should be wary of her, as if they are not vigilant, they will be crippled by her Psionic Traps, letting her catch up, or materialize herself beside them with the help of a Blink Dagger, then finish them off in only a few swings of her Psi Blades. With proper timing and the right tools, Lanaya can protect herself from powerful nukes, evade the enemy team, and even have the potential to wipe out an entire team with perfect positioning and quick actions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Capable of shredding armor and dealing massive amounts of physical damage.<br/>Can be very elusive.<br/>Provides some free vision for team.<br/>Can efficiently farm Ancient stacks.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very vulnerable to damage over time abilities.<br/>Meld by itself is not a reliable escape mechanism.<br/>Rather dependent on good positioning to make most use of Psi Blades' spill AoE.<h2>Tips</h2><h3>General</h3>Templar Assassin is almost always played in the mid lane.<br/>While Templar Assassin is a situational pick, when drafted properly she can spiral out of control and enter a state of near invulnerability. This allows an experienced player halt the opposing side at the start of the midgame, preventing the match from ever reaching the late game.<br/>Templar Assassin requires an aggressive play style in order to be effective.<br/>Templar Assassin reaches her damage peak at around level 11, earlier than most carries, through the use of Refraction and Meld.<br/>Due to her early damage peak, snowballing is crucial to TA being successful. You'll want to have both your Blink Dagger and Desolator as early as possible, ideally no later than 20 minutes.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Refraction</h4>Refraction places two separate buffs onto Templar Assassin to keep track of the bonus damage and protection portion. Therefore, each buff is tracked independently and depleting one of the buffs does not affect the other.<br/>Attacking allied units does not use up a Refraction charge. Use this to preserve your Refraction charges in lane for more damage.<br/>Just like Meld, Refraction has an instant cast with no animation nor backswing.<br/>Refraction and Meld deal physical damage and are effective against siege creeps and ancient creeps. Refraction's bonus damage also works on towers.<br/>Refraction's cooldown is the same as its duration. Try to plan on entering a fight when its duration is almost finished, so you can re-cast Refraction shortly after it expires for two sets of damage block and bonus damage.<br/>Refraction has a minimum damage threshold of 5, meaning that damage less than 5 is fully ignored by Refraction and is not absorbed. Because of this, enemies can still disable Blink Dagger through Refraction with the help of a damage source that deals very little damage such as Orb of Venom.<br/>You can bait out powerful abilities (mostly ultimates) by casting Refraction just before the ability is cast. This does require quick reflexes, but if done right, abilities such as Finger of Death or Reaper's Scythe can be wasted and give your team a bit of breathing room.<h4>Meld</h4>Meld is instant invisibility with no fade time and can be used to disjoint projectiles.<br/>An early point in meld can help significantly reduce harassment from other mid heroes, such as Queen of Pain and her Shadow Strike or Tinker and his Rockets, or to disjoint the attacks from a tower that may follow you after a gank.<br/> Enemies cannot remove Meld without altering Lanaya's position in some way.
<br/>However, Meld is not removed by spells and abilities that forces movement in a vertical manner, such as Nyx Assassin's Impale, Sand King's Burrowstrike, Kunkka's Torrent, Lion's Earth Spike, Tidehunter's Ravage and from Cyclone-based abilities such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity and Tornado.<br/>Additionally, despite X Marks the Spot shifting Layana's location, Meld is not removed by that ability.<br/>Telekinesis will only remove Meld if the sub-ability is used. It will not remove Meld by itself.<br/>Toss will only remove Meld if Layana is tossed towards another unit. If Layana is both the Toss object and the Toss target, it will not remove Meld since she is only being moved vertically.<br/>It can be difficult to hit an enemy from within Meld without a high level in Psi Blades. Use Psionic Trap, Blink Dagger, or disables from teammates to get close to enemies.<br/>Meld is very useful for evading enemies when you can use it just out of sight. For example, say you are being chased towards some stairs while you are on the lower ground. Using Meld once you reach the high ground will often leave assailants confused and can sometimes lead to them continuing on in the direction you were originally headed if they assume you just blinked in that direction.<br/>Maxing meld is incredibly powerful against a team with two or more heroes that can tear down refraction very fast. Such heroes (Pudge and Venomancer are common picks) have low armor and will be quickly taken care of.<h4>Psi Blades</h4>Against an enemy lineup that consists of entirely ranged Heroes, you may need to max Psi Blades early in order to have any chance of last hitting and harassing efficiently while laning.<br/>Psi Blades deal pure damage, not physical, meaning whatever is behind her initial target will take the same damage as the primary target. As such, try to position yourself so that you either deny and last hit at the same time or harass your foe out of the lane.<br/>If you are having trouble with attacking with Meld, putting more points on Psi Blades instead of Meld early game may be a better choice. At most, a level 2 Psi Blades gives Lanaya decent enough range for her early-mid game, spending the rest of her ability points on Refraction and Meld for higher damage output.<br/>The spill area of Psi Blades is positioned based on where you are when the projectile lands, not the direction the projectile came from. This can be used to score some very strange kills with a blink dagger.<h4>Psionic Trap</h4>Psionic Traps can be used for vision. Place traps in narrow walkways to monitor enemy movement. Traps can also be used to maintain vision of runes and the Roshan pit.<br/>Psionic Trap gains 5% more slow for every second after placement. Try to place your traps slightly ahead of enemies and let them charge past the base 30%.<br/>The movement speed from Drum of Endurance, Yasha, and Phase Boots helps Lanaya chase enemies caught in her Psionic Trap.<br/>You are allowed eleven Traps at max level. This allows you to permanently place traps in key spots such as rune locations and Roshan's pit for vision while having a respectable amount left over for fights.<br/>Other useful places for Traps include the top of stairs, secret shops and other common chokepoints.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Terrorblade is a potent carry who demolishes buildings and heroes alike with his illusions. With Metamorphosis, he transforms into an imposing demon avatar, gaining the ability to deal high damage at range. However, Terrorblade's low natural health makes him quite fragile in the early game, and his reach is rather limited without Metamorphosis.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high damage during Metamorphosis.<br/>Good pusher.<br/>High base armor<br/>Fast farmer<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very low starting health.<br/>Highly cooldown dependent<br/>Low mobility.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Terrorblade is fairly item dependent, and needs to be able to farm well.<br/> Terrorblade's item builds are versatile, and can range from an early/mid-game oriented build such as , , and , to a more conservative late game build such as a / rush into  (similar to how you can itemize  or ).
<br/>Build items this way to make his illusions stronger and to tank more magical damage since he has natural high armor to soak physical damage.<br/>Even though he is usually built in a more or less stable item progression, newly added items can benefit him greatly through early/mid game.<br/>Dragon Lance is the best gold-to-stat ratio item currently in-game and increases his range in Metamorphosis by a considerable amount, making sieges much safer and positional options more open, as well as the items natural progression into a Hurricane Pike which increases Terrorblades mobility and adds a higher damage output or a means of escape.<br/>Second best stat-to-gold ratio item is Diffusal Blade, and Terrorblade along with his illusions can really abuse the item. All of his illusions will apply the Mana Burn and the active ability Purge is his best friend against his own bane, SILENCE, whilst the slow can be pretty useful to maintain the enemy position in a place where you can bombard them from afar.<br/>Echo Sabre is not to be overlooked either. Terrorblade has a relatively low mana pool and a low intelligence gain, but his naturally high agility makes him a hard hitter that likes to "man up" on heroes that rely on basic attack damage. Echo Sabre double strike ability and its applied slow significantly increase damage output, while the stats boost illusion max HP pool and offer Terrorblade a way to recover mana when out of base.<br/>Armlet of Mordiggian doesn't appear as a fitting item for Terrorblade on first glance, but its insane armor increase (and Terrorblades naturally high armor), together with its active makes it a strategically useful item for a split pushing/ganking type of play. Activating Unholy Strength before summoning illusions (be it from his own ability or a Manta Style) and immediately turning it off, gives your illusions a big increase in max HP, making them viable for pushing without the creep wave. The health drain of Armlet can be abused when coupled with a " Shadow Blade/ Blink Dagger/Really good sense of positioning" to purposely drain HP and execute a Sunder gank (very effective with a Legion Commander, for example).<br/>Terrorblade excels at split pushing in the mid and late game, where he can summon up to four Metamorphosed illusions with a Manta Style.<br/>Sunder allows Terrorblade to dominate any one-versus-one fights with heroes that can't disable or prevent you from casting it.<br/> While laning, use your illusions to stack the jungle for yourself. Then once the laning stage breaks down, you can use Metamorphosis to clear jungle stacks, thereby increasing your GPM.
<br/>When appropriate, farm the jungle with the main Terrorblade while micro-ing Terrorblade illusions to farm in lane to boost your GPM.<br/>To master the laning phase, make sure to use illusions as a means to draw creep aggro (keeping yourself safely behind) when your tower is under siege, effectively dragging them to a safer place to farm, while considerably lessening damage done to the tower.<br/>His illusions offer a great deal of scouting potential, as they're long lasting. If summoned at appropriate locations (usually runespots, either in river or safely on your own highground), his illusions can easily creep-cut and bring the creepwave into the jungle, making split-pushing much easier and effective.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Reflection</h4>Use Reflection to slow down a fleeing or pursuing enemy.<br/>One level on Reflection is usually enough in the early game.<br/>Reflections of enemy illusions can also use their passives. Casting it on heroes like Anti-Mage or Spectre can greatly cripple them.<br/>Be vary of using Reflection during Metamorphosis, as its cast time is increased during the effect. Using the ability just before going into Metamorphosis creates enough confusion for you to reposition.<br/>Use reflection to cancel salves and clarity. This can win the lane by denying mana or hp regen.<br/>Reflection is good to harass under the enemy tower for a squishy carry trying to last hit.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Conjure Image</h4>With enough points in Conjure Image, Terrorblade can become an efficient jungler who can clear multiple camps with reasonable speed.<br/>At higher levels, it is important to stack whenever your illusions aren't helping you in effective farming/zoning. This will increase your GPM by a significant amount.<br/>Illusions draw creep aggro, which can be abused to draw creeps away from your tower or into jungle camps, further increasing your GPM.<br/>Long lasting, the illusions can offer a means to scout out for any incoming ganks or enemy junglers, as well as a safe way to break highground.<br/>They are visually distinguishable from the original, but can still look quite convincing if you micromanage them into a behavior that would appear to be the real Terrorblade (i.e. running when an enemy approaches).<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Metamorphosis</h4>Metamorphosis is what makes Terrorblade do high damage.<br/>Always keep Metamorphosis off cooldown if you suspect a teamfight is about to breakout.<br/>Metamorphosis has a high cooldown meaning you have to make good use of it should you choose to activate it. Avoid using it to farm camps, unless it is a stacked Ancient camp.<br/> One way to be more effective is to level Metamorphosis along with Attributes Bonus. By doing this, you make Terrorblade more suitable for staying in lanes with more damage, health and mana. By the time Metamorphosis is maxed, you will have enought stats to make better illusions. 
<br/>You can continue on getting Bonus Attributes even in the midgame for better stats if you think that you do not need much skill points on Sunder.<br/>Unless you're pushing the enemy towers, try not to activate Metamorphosis in teamfights until you have reached your attack range on the chosen target. If you ensure to only activate it when youre within range of basic attacks, you will maximize the effective damage you deal and coupled with Reflections slow you can keep the enemy within attack range long enough to eliminate them completely. This is very important in the first few usages of Metamorphosis as Terrorblade is VERY slow during it before obtaining a Yasha-based item.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Sunder</h4>It is always better to use Sunder too early than too late.<br/>While Sunder is most often used to save yourself from death or nuke an enemy carry, it can also be used to save allies. However, since Terrorblade often serves as the team's main carry, leaving yourself with very little health can be a game-risking mistake.<br/>If you are below 25% HP and have no one to sunder, you can spawn an illusion and sunder it. This is mostly useful later into the game where 25% of your HP is boosted by the stats you get from items.<br/>Upon filling all of your six item slots, a viable item to purchase as a "seventh slot" (usually in stash or courier) is a Refresher Orb. With a good usage it can completely turn teamfights, since Sunder and Metamorphosis are strong, but high-cooldown abilities.<br/>Example: Initiators tend to start the fight and usually take the bulk of the punishment (especially late-game). If you have quick fingers, you can Sunder your HP to the initiator, which will fill him up to 100%, use Refresher Orb, and immediately Sunder an enemy of choice, leaving them vulnerable if not dead. This is especially useful once your Sunder is level 3, as it drains no mana, allowing you to use Refresher Orb without being rendered useless due to a relatively small mana pool.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Troll Warlord is one of the strongest hard carries in the whole game. His signature ability, Berserker's Rage, allows him to switch between melee and ranged autoattacks, both with their pros and cons. He is most devastating in a one vs. one situation because of his ability Fervor but he also can put out major damage in teamfights with Whirling Axes either slowing the enemy or making them miss. Finally, his ultimate Battle Trance gives the hero and his team increased attack speed, useful for taking objectives such as Roshan or enemy buildings.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very fast attack speed<br/>One of the best 1v1 heroes in the game<br/>Melee and ranged forms<br/>Global, multipurposed ultimate<br/>Can chainstun the enemy by bashing<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item dependent<br/>No escape mechanism<br/>Extremely vulnerable to disables<br/>Depends on lifesteal and bashes for survivability<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>At level 25 without items and with 7 stacks of fervor and his ultimate Troll Warlord reaches 597/600 attack speed.<br/>Troll Warlord is faster in melee mode, making it easier to chase or escape from enemies. It also increases your armor, so switching to melee form whenever damage is received reduces the overall damage you take.<br/>You can opt for the strategy to kill Roshan early. Troll Warlord with HotD and Phase boots can easily kill Roshan thanks to his bash and high attack speed against single targets. In addition the use of a smoke may allow a sneaky Rosh.<br/>When your target enemy is starting to become harder to chase in melee form, keep in mind that you still have a Ranged form. Ranged Whirling Axes can aid in crippling them, so that you can revert back to melee form to finish them off.<br/> Augment Troll Warlord's power with damage-boosting items, since his power lies in his excellent attack speed.
<br/>Ally buffs such as Magnus's Empower can also be a good source of boosting damage.<br/>Because of its scaling boost to attack speed Fervor is usually leveled up last with 1 point at level 4 for tower pushing/Roshan/beating on a single hero. Having your move speed and bash duration higher will greatly benefit your survivability and chase, since Fervor is extremely good with even only 1 skill point. But keep in mind that since a recent update the first stack is always active.<br/>It's better to focus on one target rather than switching from one to another, since Fervor makes him more dangerous the more he attacks the same target with each blow.<br/> Attack speed items such as  and  allow you to build up Fervor more quickly, but do not scale well if you opt to max it early on.
<br/>If you're 6-slotted, sell any attack speed items for higher damage items. With all skills levelled, Troll Warlord easily achieves his maximum attack speed, so items like Mjollnir are much less useful.<br/>Drum of Endurance and Sange and Yasha are strong items coupled with the bonuses from Berserker's Rage, giving you even greater mobility to prevent kiting.<br/> , ,  and  are the only few Unique Attack Modifiers that stack with the commonly opted .
<br/>Maelstrom is an excellent source of early-game and mid-game damage, but upgrading to a Mjollnir is discouraged as Troll Warlord hardly benefits from the 80 attack speed it provides. Instead of upgrading your Maelstrom, sell it for higher damage items such as Daedalus, or Monkey King Bar, or utility items such as Eye of Skadi, Black King Bar or Heaven's Halberd.<br/> Heroes who mainly auto-attack benefit greatly from . Try to draft at least one more hard hitting carry for your team to get the most out of it. If your team insists on picking four carries, Battle Trance can often be the saving grace for a horribly gold starved team as it equates to more than a free five second Hyperstone for everyone at its first level. Contently look at the map and use Battle Trance at any engagement of allies to give them an advantage. Check at the map at use your ultimate every time someone is fighting or pushing. Communicate with your team to know when exactly you need to activate your ultimate. Be sure to always have enough mana, buy a  or an  to get more mana regen.
<br/>Battle Trance can be used to help allies in many ways even if you are not there, as the effects are global, that is why Troll is often played mid to reach level 6 quickly (and do a fast Roshan at the same time). Whether you have someone pushing a tower such as Nature's Prophet or Lycan, if Faceless Void has used Chronosphere, Legion Commander her Duel or if Ursa is Roshing, heroes with high base damage but low attack speed like Tiny, be sure to help your friends by using your Ultimate!<br/>Battle Trance does not buff Illusions, but it does work on Meepo and his clones allowing to reach the highest DPS of the game. Because Meepo is excellent at pouncing on enemies, he can generally obliterate anyone instantly once he blink/poofs in under the effects of Battle Trance. He can use Troll's ultimate to destroy buildings in backdoor.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Berserker's Rage</h4>You should always be in melee form while moving, fighting and farming to gain bonus movement speed and the chance to bash, as well as a lower BAT. The bonus movement speed will also help you flee from an enemy, as will the +6 armor.<br/>Try to finish off running heroes, zone enemy melee heroes or last-hitting creeps by changing to ranged form.<br/>When toggled on, exchanges Whirling Axes (Ranged) with Whirling Axes (Melee).<br/>The Bash chance is a measly 10% while in melee form. However, a bonus  20/30/40/50 Damage is done per bash, in addition to a 0.8/1.2/1.6/2 second stun.<h4>Whirling Axes (Ranged)</h4>Only real purpose of this spell is to slow the opponent.<br/>The melee and ranged versions of Whirling Axes have separate cooldowns. Keep this in mind when in battle, so that you can output more damage with them.<br/>You should go in melee form after casting this spell to gain bonus movement speed, making chasing more efficient.<br/>Slows 30% across all levels, but the duration of the slow goes up to 3/3.75/4.5/5.25 seconds. This is a deceptively powerful slow as the cooldown of the ability is 10 seconds at level 4, providing a 52.5% uptime on said slow. For comparison, Eye of Skadi provides a comparable slow, at 35%.<br/>This spell only deals 75 damage across all levels.<h4>Whirling Axes (Melee).</h4>This spell is your main damaging nuke, as the damage scales with level (75/125/175/225) unlike the ranged version.<br/>Axes whirl in a circle around your hero, extending to a radius of 350 units before coming back, each axe having a radius of 100 units.<br/>Inflicts a blind effect on enemy heroes and creeps, lasting 4/5/6/7 seconds and debuffing the afflicted with 60% miss chance.<br/>You should use this spell for farming, pushing, teamfights freely. However, it does NOT affect Roshan.<h4>Fervor</h4>This ability provides most of your DPS potential.<br/>Try not to constantly switch targets to prevent your Fervor stacks from resetting.<br/>Most effective for 1v1s, destroying buildings and Roshan.<br/>Synergizes with Berserker's Rage to facilitate bashing consecutively.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ursa is a simple carry/anti-tank hero who specialises in quickly taking out enemies one at a time. He is powerful from start to finish, tearing apart enemies and getting early Roshan kills for his team with the help of his passive Fury Swipes. Combined with Overpower and Enrage, Ursa can quickly take down even the toughest heroes. However, his damage output is strictly limited to melee range and he has no mobility options, making him a prime target for enemy disables and thus heavily reliant on items such as Black King Bar and Blink Dagger.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Best solo Roshan killer in the game.<br/>Very high single target damage.<br/>Efficient early/mid game jungler.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<br/>Low mobility.<br/>No disables.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Ursa's lack of ranged abilities and mobility options make him very easy to kite. Pair up with a disabler such as Lion or Shadow Shaman.<br/>Ursa's Fury Swipes ability allows him to solo-kill Roshan at very low levels with any source of lifesteal (as low as level 1 if paired with Wraith King). However, doing so makes him vulnerable to ganks by a savvy enemy team. Consider informing your team to de-ward the area around the Roshan pit regularly and using Smoke of Deceit to sneak in.<br/>Ursa can be easily shut down by disables.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Earthshock</h4>Earthshock is a low cooldown, decent damage AoE slow that is useful for crippling enemies while you lay waste to them with your right click attacks. Consider at least one value point in this skill early game as it gives you the full slow duration as well as a magic nuke which will more easily allow you to acquire kills.<br/>Though the mana cast is not high, the low cooldown combined with Ursa's small mana pool means you will fast run out of mana if you are not careful. Consider stat items/mana regeneration items to ensure you have enough mana for this and Overpower.<br/>Do not rely too much on the slow to pin down enemies; though it is very strong and lasts a good while, savvy opponents will build force staffs/glimmer capes/debuff removal items for themselves or each other, kiting you and denying you easy kills. Often it is essential to build items that give better lockdown such as Scythe of Vyse or Abyssal Blade.<h4>Overpower</h4>Overpower's cooldown is shorter than its duration. This means that Ursa can cast the ability early, use up the Overpower attacks, and then cast it again immediately after for up to 12 attacks in quick succession. Use this to maximize his burst damage and jungling efficiency.<br/>The combination of Overpower and Fury Swipes is the source of Ursa's tremendous damage output, as the greatly increased attack speed allows Ursa to build Fury Swipes stacks very quickly.<br/>The long duration of Overpower means it should be cast before a fight to let Ursa start dealing heavy damage right away.<h4>Fury Swipes</h4>Fury swipes works like troll warlords [/dota2.gamepedia.com/Troll%20Warlord Fervor]​,except that it provides damage and not attack speed.With max level for both Overpower and Fury swipes,Ursa can deal 6x plus 450 damage (x beings his base attack damage,this number can increase with enrage).<br/>Works best when you already have a stack of overpower nearing its expiry time, use Earth Shock to slow down the enemy and attack.It is usually a definite kill if you do this and after that pop in another overpower stack and use enrage.<h4>Enrage</h4>Because Fury Swipes' damage increases with the number of stacks, holding on to Enrage until Ursa has made several attacks on the target will result in a large increase in damage. This is especially useful for quickly wearing down Roshan's health.<br/>While mainly used to amplify Ursa's damage output, the dispel and damage resistance applied by Enrage mean that he can also use it to help escape enemies.<br/>Note that Enrage has a quite short duration. Enemies with long ranged or long lasting disables can therefore easily waste the Enrage buff by disabling Ursa after he has cast it. Examples of such disables are Astral Imprisonment, Nightmare, and Adaptive Strike, or even Paralyzing Cask and Malefice, which are short, but repeating stuns.<br/>Enrage does not disjoint any debuff and is not recommended to be used against undisjointable debuffs such as rupture as it only puts a strong dispel on ursa<br/>It is possible to put a dispel on Ursa during the duration of enrage,the dispel only activates at the starting of enrage and hence only removes existing debuffs.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Vengeful Spirit is a very strong and well-balanced support who specializes in roaming, ganking and disabling. Unlike most other casting supports, her skill set emphasizes physical damage over magical, allowing her abilities to be useful in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not Item dependent<br/>Abilities useful at all stages of the game<br/>Has Nukes and Disables<br/>High combat stat gains<br/>Has very good debuffs<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can be ganked very easily<br/>Limited mana pool<br/>Low attack range<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of her combination of disables and debuffs, Vengeful Spirit is an excellent roaming partner, as she can reliably stun an enemy and reduce their armor, setting them up for being finished off by teammates. Her lack of meaningful damage output and more than one disable means that she must rely on her teammates to land follow-up stuns and kill the target, however.<br/>Unlike most casting-focused supports, Vengeful Spirit benefits from an innately high strength and agility growth, giving her plenty of HP and armor. This means that, despite her sacrificial nature, she is very resilient against all types of damage, and under unusual circumstances can transition into playing as a semi-carry.<br/>Vengeful Spirit is a very item-independent hero, and can greatly contribute to fights and ganks even with only a few basic items. Combined with her strong ganking prowess, she should focus on constantly roaming and engaging the enemy, singling out key targets for elimination to buy time and space for her team.<br/>Due to her skill set, Vengeful Spirit benefits from building support utility items that grant her team an advantage in fights. Her ability to displace heroes with Nether Swap means that she benefits greatly from building mobility items that help her initiate, and her low base intelligence ensures that she must purchase mana items to allow her to cast her spells more regularly.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Magic Missile</h4>Magic Missile is a basic unit-targeted nuke that stuns and deals damage to the target.<br/>Because it is Vengeful Spirit's only damage nuke, Magic Missile is a good spell to max out first, as magic damage is more powerful in the early game when heroes have small HP pools.<br/>Beware that Magic Missile has a very high mana cost relative to Shendelzare's mana pool, and will deplete more than half of it at level 1. The target for Magic Missile must be chosen with care, as wasting the spell on a failed gank will set her back greatly.<br/> Magic Missile is a reliable stun since it will home in on its target, however it also has a very short disable duration that allows its target to act earlier. This makes Magic Missile a strong initiating stun, but also means that it requires follow-up disables from allies in order to ensure a successful kill.
<br/>Magic Missile is capable of piercing spell immunity if the Talent is chosen, giving it even greater utility by allowing Vengeful Spirit to truly interrupt any Heroes that happen to have both a Black King Bar and Linken's Sphere in their inventory.<h4>Wave of Terror</h4>Wave of Terror is a long-ranged spell that debuffs enemy armor while dealing minor nuke damage.<br/>Wave of Terror is a good candidate for maxing out early in a game, since its armor reduction can soften up enemies to weaken them against physical damage. It is a strong spell at all points in the game, since physical damage becomes a stronger factor in teamfights in the late game.<br/>Combined with Magic Missile, Wave of Terror is a strong set-up ability that damages and debuffs a gank target after they are stunned. The combination of stun, damage and armor reduction from both abilities will greatly weaken an enemy, making them much easier to kill by Vengeful Spirit's roaming ganking partner(s).<br/>Despite its narrow width, Wave of Terror has an extremely long cast range, capable of inflicting its debuff on targets from far away. This allows Vengeful Spirit to get off the debuff very reliably, inflicting multiple enemies with armor reduction before the start of a teamfight.<br/>While it deals a very small amount of damage, Wave of Terror's long cast range allows it to be used to deal player-based damage at long range. This allows the spell to be used to put an enemy Blink Dagger on cooldown, burn their Healing Salve or Clarity, and numerous other effects.<br/>Wave of Terror provides vision over its travel path, allowing the spell to be used to scout enemies in the fog of war. Combined with its ability to put Blink Dagger on cooldown, Vengeful Spirit can use it to scout out hidden initiators and foul their attempts to initiate on her team. As well, the vision and damage can be used to reveal enemies inside of treelines, particularly useful for hunting down split-pushers like Tinker, Nature's Prophet and Broodmother<h4>Vengeance Aura</h4>Vengeance Aura is a strong attack damage aura that boosts all nearby allies' physical damage, and inflicts a negative aura upon enemies when Vengeful Spirit is killed.<br/>Because physical damage is very low in the early game, Vengeance Aura is best reserved to skill only after both Magic Missile and Wave of Terror are maxed out. The ability is not very strong in the early game, and is only truly effective once maxed out and teammates have enough attack speed to make use of the bonus damage.<br/>Combined with Wave of Terror, Vengeance Aura can greatly amplify the amount of damage that allies deal with their right-clicks in ganks and teamfights.<br/>Remember that when Vengeful Spirit is killed, the negative Vengeance Aura is transferred to the enemy hero who made the kill and centered on them. While it isn't possible to control who kills Vengeful Spirit, placing the debuff on their strongest physical damage carry can severely hinder their entire team.<br/>Beware that the negative Vengeance Aura is only transferred upon a hero landing the killing blow. Try to avoid situations where it is possible to be killed by summons, creeps or towers, as that will prevent the aura from transferring.<h4>Nether Swap</h4>Nether Swap, Vengeful Spirit's signature ability, allows her to immediately re-position herself and a target hero, enemy or ally.<br/>Despite its simple mechanic, Nether Swap is an extremely flexible spell, allowing Shendel to use it for a variety of purposes. Good use of Nether Swap requires impeccable positioning on Vengeful Spirit's part, but can make or break crucial teamfights and engagements, and in the right circumstances can outright win a match.<br/>The most basic use of Nether Swap is to displace an important enemy hero, immediately placing them in the middle of Vengeful Spirit's allies and effectively securing a guaranteed kill in the right circumstances. Similarly, it can be cast on an ally who has been caught by the enemy team, bringing them to immediate safety at the cost of her own life (albeit also inflicting the enemy with the negative Vengeance Aura).<br/>In the early game, try to utilize the environment and architecture to your advantage, when allies alone cannot guarantee a kill. For instance, positioning Vengeful Spirit within attack range of an allied tower before swapping with an enemy will bring them inside of the tower's range, which can be followed up with by Magic Missile to increase the number of tower attacks they are forced to take.<br/>Nether Swap pierces spell immunity and interrupts channeling abilities, making it a strong spell even if it is not used to explicitly gank an enemy or save a teammate. For instance, an Enigma who is channeling Black Hole can be immediately interrupted from a distance even if he has an active BKB. The same applies to Freezing Field, Death Ward, and so on. Additionally, Nether Swap can be cast to immediately break Flaming Lasso if cast from a great enough distance.<br/>Beware that while Nether Swap has a very long cast range, it does not deal any damage to enemy targets, which can allow players with a Blink Dagger to simply jump away after the swap. If ganking an enemy with a Blink Dagger, try to disable it with Wave of Terror first, then target them with Magic Missile after the swap.<br/>Keep in mind that Nether Swap can be combined with other forced movement items and abilities. For instance, Force Staff can be used to push Shendel back to safety after swapping out an enemy, and similar results can be obtained with an allied X Marks the Spot and Test of Faith (Teleport).<br/>Nether Swap can also make unreliable disables and nukes easier to land by allies, with good communication and timing. For instance, standing on top of a large Techies trap or in the path of an allied Sacred Arrow or Meat Hook can allow allies to instantly secure kills using Nether Swap.<br/>Be extremely careful about Vengeful Spirit's positioning prior to casting Nether Swap, and which heroes to cast it on. Placing an enemy initiator or disabler in the middle of Vengeful Spirit's team can allow them to initiate on them with abilities like Ravage or Echo Slam. Pick your target with care, and always be sure that Shendel herself is in a position that allies are capable of exploiting prior to swapping an enemy in.<br/>If being pursued by multiple heroes, Nether Swap can be used as a juking spell. By targeting it on the furthest enemy hero, Vengeful Spirit can cause the nearest pursuers to overshoot due to a sudden change in direction, giving her extra time to escape in a different direction.<br/> With , the cooldown on Nether Swap decreases drastically, and a Vengeance Illusion spawns upon her death.
<br/>Because Vengeance Aura is possessed by the Vengeance Illusion, both the negative and positive auras can be simultaneously active, the negative centered on Shendel's killer and the positive centered on her illusion. This can provide a strong teamfight advantage for as long as the illusion is alive.<br/>The Vengeance Illusion spawns with all of its abilities off cooldown, meaning that it is immediately able to cast spells. Use this to get off an immediate round of spells if possible, as the enemy may attempt to focus down and destroy the illusion before it causes too much damage.<br/>Be mindful that as it possesses the properties of an illusion, the Vengeance Illusion can still be instantly destroyed by the right abilities. Mana Drain, Glimpse, Hex type abilities, and so on, can immediately remove the illusion from the field, so beware of the enemy's lineup and what items they possess.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Venomancer is a support hero who can deal tremendous damage over time with his spells. He also possesses strong push and counter-push potential in his Plague Wards, allowing him to defend towers and high-ground as well as take enemy towers by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can deal tremendous amounts of damage when his spells are combined.<br/>Strong slows and DOTs make him great for early ganks<br/>Wards provide lots of utility like free vision, push/counterpush, and a basic ability to jungle<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No hard disables<br/>Generally poor survivability<br/>Has mana problems early and mid game<br/>Large portions of his damage can be removed with items like Pipe of Insight or Black King Bar<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While his spells possess a large amount of raw nuking power, Venomancer lacks immediate killing power, and does not have any hard disables. Always attempt to kill enemies with the aid of teammates, as they can stun the enemy and finish them off in situations where the foe may otherwise easily escape.<br/>In general, Venomancer should be played as a pushing support who provides utility to his team, rather than as a fighter, due to his general frailty and low movement speed. As such, many of the more expensive recommended luxury items that focus on physical damage output should not be built at all, as they provide little comparative benefit and do not synergize well with Venomancer's skills. Instead, focus on building mobility and utility items that help your team without requiring you to jump into the fray outside of casting your spells.<br/>As an agility caster, Venomancer suffers from severe mana problems. It is recommended to focus on increasing the size of your mana pool and purchasing mana regen items when possible. Due to the high mana cost of Poison Nova, you need to carefully manage your mana so that you can cast it in a teamfight.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Venomous Gale</h4>Venomous Gale applies a strong slow on any enemies it hits, significantly reducing their movement speed.<br/>Venomous Gale is one of the best ranged slows at level 1, cutting enemy movement speed in half if it successfully lands. This makes it extremely powerful with just one value point in the laning stage. If you have a tri-lane that has reliable damage output, putting Venomous Gale on a target can ensure a First Blood on the enemy's off-laner.<br/>Beware that Venomous Gale costs 125 mana, and your mana pool is only 195 at level 1. As such, missing your Venomous Gale during the laning stage renders you unable to cast any other spells for some time unless you have a Clarity or other form of mana regen.<br/>Be mindful that an enemy hero afflicted by Venomous Gale can be denied by their allies, preventing Venomancer and his team from profiting from their death. Try to prevent enemies from escaping if they are affected by the spell, or try to ensure that their teammates cannot arrive in time to help them.<h4>Poison Sting</h4>Poison Sting applies a movement speed slow and damage over time to Venomancer's attacks. Half of the damage from this ability, as well as the full slow, is also applied to Plague Ward attacks.<br/>Because it applies a slow and deals magical damage over time with each attack, Poison Sting is a good spell to max out early on. Venomancer can use his attacks to harass enemies and deal large amounts of damage without having to expend mana, and the slow stacks alongside Venomous Gale, meaning that even a single value point can greatly increase Venomancer's disable potential.<br/>As both the damage and duration of the spell increase in tandem with levels, Poison Sting deals exponentially more damage as it is leveled up. Combined with Plague Wards, it is possible to place a "permanent" movement speed penalty and consistent damage over time on enemy heroes in the area.<br/>Remember that the damage from Poison Sting itself is not recognized by the game as player damage, and thus enemies can still use their Blink Daggers or regen items even while under the effects of its damage. Make sure to regularly attack enemy players with your right-clicks in order to inflict player damage on them.<br/>Be careful when trying to apply Poison Sting to enemy heroes with your attacks. Venomancer's attack range is quite short, so it is easy to accidentally put yourself out of position.<br/>When killing creep waves or neutral camps, attack each creep once at the beginning to apply the Poison Sting debuff to all of them. This drastically increases the amount of damage you can do to them, as they all are taking damage over time right from the beginning, increasing the net amount of damage you do.<br/>The idea behind leveling this ability to boost the effectiveness of your Plague Wards is that it allows them to deal the damage over time after you have left them in place and moved on. When using them in active pushes or defense, Venomancer can apply his own Poison Sting to enemy creeps, overriding that of the Plague Wards. But if he needs to go elsewhere after deploying a cluster of wards, or cannot get close to creep waves due to the risk of being initiated on by enemies, then they can benefit from Poison Sting and whittle down creep waves more effectively.<h4>Plague Ward</h4>Plague Ward is Venomancer's signature ability, allowing him to place a large number of wards in a short duration that augment his firepower and provide vision.<br/>Plague Wards deal weak damage in sparse numbers and at early levels, but their power becomes significant once 3 or more skill points are placed in them and they are massed in one location. If you are employing an early push strategy, it is wise to max Plague Wards first in order to put as much cheap Physical damage on the field as possible.<br/>Venomancer's attack range can effectively be increased by 1000 by casting Plague Wards at their maximum range. While Venomancer's attack range is only 450, he can place Plague Wards up to 850 range away, which can attack targets up to 600 range away, boosting his striking range to 1450.<br/> Plague Wards deal Piercing damage, which means that they deal increased damage against lane creeps but are less effective against towers and siege creeps. They are best used to quickly remove lane creeps from the field so that friendly creep waves can more easily reach the enemy tower.
<br/>When pushing a lane, try to place your initial wave of Plague Wards just outside of the enemy tower's attack range. This way, you can safely mass them in order to make short work of the enemy's creep wave as they approach, as well as delay the creep wave at that location and give your creeps time to move forward.<br/>Once your creep wave moves forward to attack the enemy's tower, only then should you place your second wave of Plague Wards within range to attack the tower. Without cover, the tower can make short work of your Plague Wards, preventing you from massing them. Try to place your ward cluster on the opposite side of the enemy tower, in the direction of the enemy's base, so that they attract the enemy creep wave's aggro and hold them in position, preventing them from attacking your creeps and defending the tower.<br/>Due to how frail they are and how little damage they do at level 1 and 2, it is not recommended that you cast Plague Wards too frequently during the laning stage, as they will only provide gold and experience for the enemy. As well, while they are spammable and cost small amounts of mana, placing enough to cause any meaningful amount of damage costs significantly more mana.<br/>If farming jungle camps with Plague Wards, avoid placing them as the ability comes off cooldown inside the camp itself. This reduces the amount of damage that the wards can do, and can block the camp from spawning if the wards persist at the minute mark. Instead, place a cluster of wards outside of the camp and then aggro the creeps into your wards. This concentrates their firepower and reduces the amount of damage you take, and allows you to use the same ward cluster to work down two or even three neighboring camps simultaneously by pulling them into one location where the wards can attack them and automatically aggro them back with the poison damage.<br/>Use Plague Wards constantly in order to provide vision of your surrounding area, especially when across the river and inside enemy territory. You can use them to scout out areas behind trees and up cliffs to ensure that enemies cannot initiate on you easily.<br/>When chasing an enemy that is attempting to run away, constantly put Plague Wards ahead of them to maintain sight. This also helps in applying constant Poison Sting damage, slowing their movement speed, and potentially blocking their pathing.<br/>You can place Plague Wards within juke paths to block the enemy team's movements if you are fighting in the jungle. This can be used to either stop the enemy from juking by closing off the path that they want to take, or to prevent them from pursuing you after passing through a narrow path by blocking it.<br/>Remember that you can control your Plague Wards as immovable units. This can be useful if you want to change attack targets, stop a Plague Ward's auto attack or deny friendly creeps and runes, and even destroy the Aegis of the Immortal.<h4>Poison Nova</h4>Poison Nova is a tremendously powerful debuff that can deal large amounts of magical damage to the enemy over time.<br/>While it lacks immediate punch and does not contribute much to a fight at the start, Poison Nova can put its victims at extremely low health after a few seconds, securing kills and allowing your team mop up and take map objectives afterward.<br/>Beware that Poison Nova is easily Venomancer's most expensive spell, and casting it can be very costly. Try to manage the mana that you expend from your other spells carefully, as spending too much mana may result in being unable to use your ultimate in a teamfight.<br/>Even if the enemy activates spell immunity before you can cast your ultimate, keep in mind that the debuff is still applied to them, and they start taking damage immediately once their spell immunity expires. While spell immunity effectively wastes a few seconds of your ultimate, it can still deal a lot of damage to them.<br/>Unless you have teammates who can follow up, do not use Poison Nova out of spite if you are about to be killed, as the cooldown is very long and it does not result in any kills unless the enemy is affected by other damage-over-time debuffs. The only exception to this is if you have Aghanim's Scepter and are level 16 or higher, as the cooldown is then reduced to below your respawn duration.<br/>Remember that Poison Nova can never bring an enemy below 1 HP by itself. Therefore, you should try to apply Venomous Gale or Poison Sting to your opponents immediately before or after casting Poison Nova, as both debuffs last as long as Poison Nova itself and can help guarantee that they do not survive the Poison Nova.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Viper is medium carry whose potent Nethertoxin grow more potent as his target's health diminishes. His Corrosive Skin poisons any who dares attack him, while his Poison Attack and Viper Strike slows any enemy to a crawl. Because of this, Viper is an exceedingly deadly ganker during the early game, but is less potent during the late game. Viper also lacks any disables, and struggles against enemies with spell immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful slow makes him a great ganker in the early stage.<br/>Fairly durable.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has mana issues during the early and mid game.<br/>No real disable.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Poison Attack and Viper Strike slow attack speed as well, apply them to the enemy carry to cripple their damage output.<br/>Viper is great at kiting melee carries with his large variety of slows and with an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Poison Attack</h4>Primarily leveling Poison Attack is the best way to slow and damage a target of your choice and doesn't require your opponents to attack you for the ability to be applied. If you're in a lane with supports, this is probably the strongest choice.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Nethertoxin</h4>Nethertoxin is generally the last ability to level, but if the rest of your team is capable of getting your opponents to low HP quickly, this will allow you to easily clean up fights. It's a good choice to pick up early if you want to last-hit easier.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Corrosive Skin</h4>Corrosive Skin is the best choice to max first if you'll be in situations where you and your opponent(s) will be trading blows, rather than you just attacking. The damage per level of this ability is roughly the same as Poison Attack, but greatly increases how tanky you are.<br/>Corrosive Skin is especially potent against DoT spells. Between the magic resistance and continuous reapplication of Corrosive Skin to the caster of the DoT, Viper will usually take less damage than Corrosive Skin returns.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Viper Strike</h4>Viper Strike is one of the best ganking abilities in the early game. Remember to take advantage of this.<br/>With an early aghanims scepter viper strike could be the best ability to start teamfights as its cooldown would be low<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Weaver is a slippery carry who shifts in and out of space, and turns back time to recover from his injuries. Summoning The Swarm to latch onto his enemies, Weaver can drastically reduce enemy in teamfights. Weaver is extremely item dependent, and must farm well throughout the game to be effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Elusive and hard to pin down.<br/>Reduces enemy armor.<br/>Good lane pusher.<br/>Highest base damage for ranged heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Countered by true sight.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/>Low attribute growth coupled with the lowest base stats.<br/>Very item dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Weaver is very item dependent, but is very hard to stop once he gets a Linken's Sphere.<br/>Weaver is one of the most difficult heroes to lock down, but this elusiveness can be countered by disables, true sight, and silence.<br/>Weaver is great at kiting and killing melee carries (such as Ursa) with the low cooldown of Shukuchi and the armor reduction effects of The Swarm.<br/>Though treated as hard carry, Weaver is one of the most difficult heroes to lane against because of Geminate Attack granting him the ability to hit an enemy twice in a single attack instance, effectively multiplying his damage output by two every few seconds.<br/> Weaver usually goes for . The active on  (the phase and the bonus ms) is kind of lost on Weaver since Shukuchi gives both of them already, but you can use it while Shukuchi is on cooldown. The +24 damage however is very nice, especially combined with Geminate Attack which makes it +48, a  for half the price. Also there are plenty of times where you won't be attacking that often in a fight, making the attack speed from treads somewhat irrelevant.
<br/>Alternatively, consider relying solely on Shukuchi for movement speed and skip boots entirely, focusing on more important items like Linken's Sphere and Dragon Lance for carry Weaver or Aghanim's Scepter for support Weaver.<br/>Weaver starts off with 15 strength for a total of 500 HP and poor armor. Don't hestitate to leave your fountain with a couple of Iron Branches or Circlets that you can upgrade into a Magic Wand or a Wraith Band. The only upside to having such a poor health pool is that flat HP regen is proportionally better on Weaver than on anyone else. An Enchanted Mango or a Ring of Regen (that will later upgrade into Drum of Endurance for example) will go a long way to keeping Weaver healthy.<br/>Bottle is a very interesting choice on Weaver. Its flat HP regen does wonders on Weaver's poor health pool and the mana will help you to spam Shukuchi. You may not want to contest for runes considering how fragile you are (though you could try to swipe one under the enemy's nose with Shukuchi). Once you reach level 6, you can always use a Town Portal Scroll to regenerate in your fountain, fill your bottle, and go right back to lane with your Time Lapse.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>The Swarm</h4>Use The Swarm to soften up enemies before a teamfight.<br/>Use The Swarm to latch onto enemies, keeping vision over them if they try to juke into the trees.<br/>Use The Swarm before diving, so towers will target the beetles instead of you.<br/>Use The Swarm to farm Ancient camps early on.<br/>When attacking towers, use The Swarm on an incoming enemy creep wave. This will cause the creeps to stop and attack the beetles, giving you and your creeps more time to attack the tower.<br/>The Swarm fully works on Roshan (armor reduction) and the beetle will also tank a couple of attacks for you. Weaver is actually a decent hero for level 1 Roshan attempts if your team wishes to try it (it will not be enough by itself however).<h4>Shukuchi</h4>Shukuchi is your main spell and you will be using it all the time provided you have enough mana regen. It provides you, by itself, with no less than 3 means to escape or chase: it turns you invisible (potentially dodging slow projectiles such as Wraithfire Blast), it gives you 522 movement speed and you cannot be slowed, it gives you a phase movement allowing you to go through units. It also deals a bit of damage. In 95% of your games, you will want to max it first.<br/>Use Shukuchi to dive and harass enemies by touching them.<br/>Shukuchi allows Weaver to return to fights and deal a little extra damage, even when his health is low.<br/> Since using Shukuchi doesn't interrupt channeled spells, you can use a  and then cast Shukuchi to hide while you finish the channel.
<br/>This can be used when teleporting to escape or when teleporting to defend something. For example, if you cast teleport on a tower you want to defend, then Shukuchi right before the teleport channel completes, when you arrive at the tower, you will be invisible. This can cause confusion for the enemy, since they will not see you appear when the teleport completes, and may think that you cancelled the teleport.<br/>Attacking, using another spell or using any items will finish Shukuchi. When chasing an enemy, be sure to catch up with him as much as possible while you have 522ms before attacking him. Similarly, when you're running away, be sure to use your Magic Wand or to tread-switch when Shukuchi is over. Weaver is fragile enough with Shukuchi having a downtime of 2 seconds, don't make that downtime even longer.<h4>Geminate Attack</h4>Geminate Attack is excellent for harassing a laning opponent. You can even try to push hard for a kill with it under tower if the enemy is low enough, though it should only be done if the enemy laner has no way to stun you.<br/>It will not activate while denying your own creeps.<br/>The second attack gets all the properties from your own right click. That means that it will lifesteal, it will crit if you have a Crystalys or similar, it has 35% chance to mini-stun and deal 160 magic damage if you have a Monkey King Bar, it can even stun if you have a Skull Basher or an Abyssal Blade (not the most recommended item on Weaver, but better on him than on most ranged heroes thanks to Geminate Attack).<h4>Time Lapse</h4>Use Time Lapse after buying back to immediately return to the fight. This is a risky maneuver, however, as you most likely won't be at full HP when you arrive. Consider using this trick when you got nuked by a strong ultimate like ( Finger of Death or Laguna Blade). Using Shukuchi immediately after Time Lapse will also improve your survivability.<br/>Time Lapse removes most debuffs from Weaver, which is useful for removing Dust of Appearance and many other hazardous debuffs.<br/>When retreating, a confusing tactic is to run towards the enemy, then use Time Lapse to return to the original spot and escape in the opposite direction.<br/>If you use Time Lapse after respawning, you should arrive next to where you died. This can serve as a poor man's tp if you died next to your tower, but it can also allow some sneaky structure damage: if you died next to an enemy tier 3 tower, and there are (allied) creeps about to push another t3 when you respawn, you can be suddenly pushing two t3s at once, and the opponent might not be expecting you to come out of the blue hitting buildings. Don't do this if there are no allied creeps as backdoor protection will kick in.<br/>If you've farmed an Aghanim's Scepter, you can use Time Lapse every 12 seconds on your allies at a considerable 1000 range. If you have a hard hitting ally that wants to land a couple of auto attacks on an enemy tower, he should be able to do with ease if he knows you're ready to save him.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ancient Apparition is a spellcaster hero whose abilities can empower, disable and destroys with the power of ice. His ultimate, Ice Blast allows him to damage & froze his foes HP regeneration, placing them on disadvantages during every teamfight thus making him scales very well into late game. However, Kaldr is not a beginner friendly support as his skillset require precise timing and judgement to execute. He also quite fragile as he does not really possesses any reliable/instant escape and disables mechanisms.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong team fight ultimate.<br/>Long range scouting spells.<br/>(The only) hard counter to healing heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very squishy and sluggish.<br/>Require good precision & judgement to make use of his skills (especially his ultimate).<br/>Harassment and zoning ability is rather poor.<br/>Very level dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Ancient Apparition's spells, although spammable, are very mana-expensive. Be mindful of your mana consumption.<br/>Any heroes that possess reliable stun/slows such as Wraith King/Lion/Shadow Demon etc. synergize very well with Kaldr's Cold Feet and Ice Vortex; results in extensive magical damage & disables duration.<br/>Compare to other supports alike, Ancient Apparition was very level dependent in order to scale; thus making him a legit Hand of Midas holder.<br/>Kaldr's abilities require a certain amount of skill and teamwork to make the best out of him; although primarily played as a lane support hero, a good early game allows AA to snowball and possessing a Aghanim's Scepter allows him to scale extremely well into late game.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Cold Feet</h4>At level 4, Cold Feet's cooldown is only 7 seconds while the stun lasts for 3.5 seconds and it takes 4 seconds to trigger it. It is possible to keep an enemy always under the effect of Cold Feet, either the stun or the damage.<br/>The damage part is dispellable by any dispel, don't waste your mana against a hero that will shrug it off with a low-cd spell.<br/>Tiny's Toss counts as distance travelled, and will therefore remove Cold Feet's debuff, even when the target is tossed straight up.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Ice Vortex</h4>Ice Vortex's cast range is huge. Use it to scout Roshan, to give vision of the high ground, to reveal common juking spots etc.<br/>Ice Vortex's cooldown is only 4 seconds. In the later stages of a game, once you have enough mana, spam it.<br/>If you already used Chilling Touch and you're too fragile to get near a team fight to use Cold Feet, you should at least stay behind and spam it.<h4>Chilling Touch</h4> Extremely strong ability for early game team fights: can deal up to 150/240/350/480 damage per buffed ally, and up to 750/1200/1750/2400 damage with 5 buffed heroes (before reductions).
<br/>It's especially strong at level 1 since the enemies will lack mobility (including Boots of Speed) to escape before it's too late.<br/>It doesn't work against towers, but you can remove the buff by clicking on the icon (which you can want since it does reduce your attack speed by 20).<br/>Synergizes well with heroes that have built-in attack speed: Ursa, Troll Warlord, Echo Sabre to name a few.<h4>Ice Blast</h4>The only ability in the game that prevents healing, making it a direct counter to a plethora of heroes.<br/>There are only four abilities that can help you regain life while frostbitten: Terrorblade's Sunder, Weaver's Time Lapse, Undying's Decay and Phoenix's Supernova.<br/>Heroes who rely on regenerating rapidly during teamfight such as Alchemist/Bloodseeker/Abaddon will be rendered useless under the effect of Ice Blast, thus placing them on disadvantages during the encounters. Although becoming spell immune prior getting hit by the blast can negate the impact damage however the freezing debuff pierce through immunity and cannot be dispelled.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bane is a very powerful single-target disabler who possesses reasonable nuking power. His strongest suit is setting up kills for teammates with high damage output or unreliable stuns, making him a powerful roamer and ganker who can assist teammates in getting kills throughout a match. This can allow him to regularly obtain reliable gold through kills and assists, which in turn allows him to build items to suit his needs.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful single-target disabler.<br/>Excellent starting stats, good at trading hits in the laning stage.<br/>Excellent damage.<br/>Great laning phase and ganking abilities, seeing that Nightmare can be used is many ways, be it to save or to set up combos and ganks.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Zero AoE capabilities, poor against early pushing line ups.<br/>Suffers with mana problems early game.<br/>Zero Mobility.<br/>Ultimate requires channeling.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While he possesses strong disables, Bane suffers from a poor mana pool and no escape spells, meaning that he can run out of mana quite often while casting his high-cost low-cooldown spells, and can be easily killed if caught out of position. As such, Bane should focus on building items to increase the size of his mana pool and give himself mana regen, as well as mobility items to give him initiation and escape ability.<br/>Keep in mind, all of Bane's spells are single-target, which makes him quite easy to be countered by items such as Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb. As well, his single-target nature means that he is unable to disable more than two enemies in an engagement unless additional disables can be obtained through farming items. Be sure to factor this into each game, as the enemy team's lineup as well as that of your own can vary, and as a result drastically affect Bane's effectiveness in that match.<br/>Bane can be played effectively as a side lane support due to his combination of disabling and nuking power. Nightmare can be used to set up kills against lane opponents or hinder them from pursuing in the event of rotations and ganks from either side, while Enfeeble provides a safe way to harass the enemy and prevent them from getting last-hits. As well, Brain Sap can be a strong damage nuke to cast in the event of ganking targets as it deals Pure damage to the enemy while also healing Bane.<br/>Bane's high base movement speed and disabling potential also allows him to be played as a roamer, especially if combined with a teammate with an unreliable but strong disable. His movement speed allows him to quickly get within range to cast Nightmare on a gank target, holding them in position for up to four seconds and making them easy targets for a follow-up disable.<br/>Beware that while Bane is a strong disabler, he is also quite frail and easy to kill if focused by the enemy; as such, he is not a very strong first initiator in teamfights, but can be a strong second-wave disabler who casts his disables once the enemy's attention is not focused on him. As well, he has a very long cast animation on his spells (0.5 seconds on most spells, compared to the standard 0.3 seconds on most heroes), so it is necessary to plan ahead when casting spells.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Enfeeble</h4>Enfeeble can reduce its target's attack damage by a tremendous amount, making their physical attacks much less effective. Its extremely long cast range also allows the debuff to be placed on targets from long range and complete safety.<br/>Enfeeble has a very long cast range, and its cooldown allows it to be simultaneously active on two enemies at a time, making it a powerful laning spell for preventing the enemy from farming or trading attacks. However, keep in mind Bane's small base mana pool, and be conservative with its casting as spamming the spell can render Bane unable to use his other spells if they are needed.<br/> Enfeeble generally has two uses in the laning stage: preventing the enemy carry from getting last-hits and shutting down their farming, or hindering their ability to output physical damage when harassing or attempting to gank. In both cases, only one or two points in the ability are needed, as Bane should expend skill points on other important spells.
<br/>Although it is generally not recommended, it's part of what makes Bane such a fearsome mid-laner. You can trade hits and deny farm very effectively with Enfeeble and spam Brain Sap to heal you back up; and you can set-up any support rotation easily with Nightmare (or while you gank the side-lanes).<br/>However, Bane's damage scales pretty poorly and good opponents will quickly nullify your contribution by cancelling Nightmare and Fiend's Grip, therefore wasting most of the farm your team granted you in the middle lane.<br/>One very powerful aspect of Enfeeble is that it cannot be dispelled, neither by regular dispels nor strong dispels. While it can be blocked from being cast on spell immune targets, it cannot be removed once placed, which means that heroes with spell immunity will still suffer from greatly reduced attack damage. This means that placing the debuff on the enemy's strongest physical damage carry at the start of a fight will greatly hinder their damage output. As well, the debuff will remain visible on the enemy through Mirror Image-type abilities such as Manta Style and Doppelganger, making the real hero easy to identify among the illusions.<h4>Brain Sap</h4>Brain Sap acts as both a heal and a nuke, allowing Bane to deal Pure damage to enemies and heal himself simultaneously.<br/>Due to its high damage output, Brain Sap is the first ability that Bane should max out, as its nuking power gives Bane strong team-fight contribution. Its low cooldown also allows it to be used to maintain Bane's health pool once he has secured a source of mana regeneration.<br/>While its high mana cost relative to Bane's mana pool does not allow him to spam this spell in-lane, trading HP with the enemy can allow Bane to be surprisingly resilient, which can catch the enemy off-guard. Given a source of mana regen, Bane can use the spell to harass and replenish HP, rendering the enemy's lane untenable.<br/>Remember that unlike most damage nukes in the game, Brain Sap deals Pure damage rather than Magical. This can be used to your advantage to damage or even finish off enemies that have strong magic resistance, as it can cut through abilities like Berserker's Blood and Flame Guard.<br/>If Bane is the target of a gank, it can be wise to reserve Brain Sap until the very end, when Bane is at very low HP, in order to lure the enemy into a false sense of security and bait them into committing to a gank. As Brain Sap creates an HP shift double what is listed (Bane is healed at the same time that the enemy is damaged), this can be used to turn the tables on enemy ganks if allies are already rushing to your aid.<h4>Nightmare</h4>Nightmare is one of Bane's signature abilities, and what makes him one of the most powerful level 1 disablers in the game. With just one point in the ability, it can lock down an enemy for up to 4 seconds, rendering them helpless and giving teammates plenty of time to re-position and set up for the kill.<br/>The best use of Nightmare is to hold an enemy in position and allow allies to land their unreliable stuns with ease. This is best done when combined with abilities such as Sacred Arrow, Split Earth, Torrent, and so on.<br/>Remember that Nightmare does not always have to be cast on the primary target. If attempting to get kills on two enemies, casting Nightmare on a secondary target can prevent them from acting, allowing your team to focus fully on the first target without interruption.<br/>Nightmare can also be used in a defensive situation. If multiple enemies are attempting to gank Bane or an ally, casting Nightmare on one of them will remove them from the fight, reducing the numbers that the enemy are able to bring to bear.<br/>One of Nightmare's greatest weaknesses when used offensively is that it can be transferred via physical attacks, even by other enemies. This means that enemy players can save their team-mates by ordering an attack on an ally afflicted with Nightmare to remove the debuff from them and allow them to act; this can be repeated over time and even done at range with ranged heroes. As such, it is best to use Nightmare in situations where there are no other enemies who can interrupt it, such as when ganking the enemy's mid, or to use an additional disable on other nearby enemies.<br/>In tandem to the above, make sure that when setting up for a kill, not to initiate it with a physical attack. This will not only wake up the target prematurely, but will also transfer the Nightmare to an ally, rendering them unable to act unless awoken.<br/>Keep in mind that Nightmare will render its target invulnerable for the first second of its duration. When cast on himself or an ally, it can allow Bane to effectively dodge projectiles and spells for one second, potentially wasting enemy spells.<br/>While active on an enemy, Nightmare will eliminate any vision that they might otherwise have. This can be used to mask allied movement while setting up on a lone enemy, as they and their team-mates will have no information about your team's positions prior to the Nightmare being removed.<br/>Nightmare End can allow Bane to immediately end all active instances of Nightmare. This can be useful for removing the debuff from an ally without ordering an attack on them, which requires Bane to get within attack range and take the Nightmare debuff.<h4>Fiend's Grip</h4>Fiend's Grip is one of the most powerful channeled disables in the game, allowing Bane to lock down an enemy for up to 5 seconds through spell immunity.<br/>Fiend's Grip is a very powerful ganking spell, as it can lock down an enemy and deal tremendous damage to them while Bane's allies also throw their damage nukes and attacks into the mix. Unlike Nightmare, the enemy can still be attacked and damaged during the disable, making it much more powerful.<br/>Because it is a channeled ability, Fiend's Grip can be interrupted by disables such as stuns and silences, more-so since Bane himself is immobile for the duration of the spell and can also simply be focused down and killed by physical attacks. Be sure to position yourself prior to casting this spell such that the enemy cannot reach you, or build countermeasures to prevent disables from affecting you.<br/>Remember that Fiend's Grip will drain its target's mana, not simply disable them while dealing damage. This can allow Bane to replenish a portion of his mana during the disable, enough to cast another spell at the end. As such, if you are low on mana then it can be beneficial to use Fiend's Grip first, as Bane can recover some mana during its duration, potentially enough to cast another spell that would otherwise not be possible with a different spell order.<br/>Using all of Bane's spells in combination can allow him to disable and nuke down single targets, making him a very powerful ganker. He can initiate on a lone enemy using Nightmare, then re-position to set up for the kill, interrupt Nightmare by casting Fiend's Grip, then finish off the target with a Brain Sap at the end. Used to set up kills with team-mates, it can provide a 7 second setup time, then 5 seconds of hard disable during which they can attack and cast damage nukes.<br/>As Fiend's Grip is a channeled spell, spells and item abilities can be cast immediately afterwards by shift-queueing them during the channel. This will allow Bane to immediately use those abilities once Fiend's Grip ends, preventing it from being ended prematurely.<br/>When upgraded by Aghanim's Scepter, Fiend's Grip greatly increases in lethality and disabling potential. The increased channel time gives allies more time to kill the enemy, while the drastically increased mana drain percentage allows Bane to almost completely drain away the target's mana, leaving them virtually impotent even if they survive the channel. Additionally, inflicting Nightmare on enemies that attempt to attack Bane during the channel will paralyse even more members of the enemy team, leaving them wide open for follow-up by Bane's allies.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Batrider is a Intelligence hero great at ganking, most focused on disrupting the enemy team's positioning and isolating enemies. His Flaming Lasso can be used to single out certain heroes, along with using his Sticky Napalm to increase the damage his enemies take. His Firefly allows him to move over terrain, opening numerous possibilities for him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the best slows in-game<br/>Good ganker<br/>Strong early game presence<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low Attack Range<br/>Low Movement Speed<br/>Item Dependency<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Batrider can effectively jungle early with a few points put into Firefly and Sticky Napalm. Make sure to stack the camps to maximize income!<br/>Make sure you have a Blink Dagger and a Smoke of Deceit when you gank with Flaming Lasso. Most enemies will not know what hit them.<br/>Remember that Batrider has only 1200 day vision while most other heroes have 1800, keep this in mind when ganking.<br/>During the mid-game, remember to go for ganks with smoke, often times only one other hero is needed to secure kills.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Sticky Napalm</h4>Batrider can dominate the middle lane thanks to Sticky Napalm, and even be able to go for kills with Firefly and a few stacks of napalm on the enemy midlaner.<br/>Always keep in mind that Sticky Napalm provides vision for 2 seconds on its location. Combined with the free-pathing from Firefly, it should be impossible to juke you.<br/> Firefly's damage is dealt twice per second, so the bonus damage from sticky napalm will also be counted twice. Therefore, one single stack of napalm will increase Firefly's DPS on heroes by 20/30/40/50.
<br/>Against heroes, an extra point in Napalm will be as valuable as an extra point in Firefly once you've reached two stacks of Napalm on that hero. If you're having troubles getting more than one or two on an opponent, you're better off with extra points in Firefly since it will also increase the damage of everything that's not covered in Napalm. However, if you can isolate a target, the DPS increase from Napalm will be better than the on from Firefly once you reach three stacks.<h4>Flamebreak</h4>It has an insane 1500 cast range. If you've managed to get away from a team fight with a sliver of HP, you can still probably turn around and throw your molotov from a safe distance before going back to your fountain.<br/>Be wary however that the knock-back from Flamebreak can push an opponent at a safe distance from your ally.... Just as easily as it can shove him back into your ally's grip...<br/>Flamebreak does not cancel any channeled abilities, so the previous point becomes especially important when someone is trying to cancel a Town Portal Scroll for example.<br/>Does 4/5/6/7 instances of damage. As a purely hypothetical scenario, with 10 stacks of level 4 Napalm, it could deal up to 4/5/6/7*(25/30/35/40 + 10*25) = 1,100/1,400/1,710/2,030 magic damage before any reduction or amplification.<h4>Firefly</h4>Use Firefly to approach enemies from angles they would not expect you, or to hide in the trees and wait for an opportunity to arise.<br/>Batrider can also be a viable solo offlaner thanks to flying movement Firefly gives, allowing for a somewhat reliable escape from bad situations.<br/>Does a total of 37 ticks of damage. As a purely hypothetical scenario, with 10 stacks of level 4 Napalm, it could deal up to 37*(35 + 10*25) = 10,545 magic damage before any reduction or amplification.<br/> When you're jungling, extra points in Sticky Napalm are more valuable than extra points in Firefly. Even with its damage reduced against creeps, Napalm scales better once you've reached 4-5 stacks.
<br/>As an example, let's assume you are level 3. You can either have 2 points in Firefly in which case you can deal 37*(15 + 10*2.5) = 1480 damage; or two points in Napalm in which case you can deal 37*(5 + 10*5) = 2035 damage. Overall, that extra point in Napalm is as valuable as the extra point in Firefly once you've reached 4 stacks (since 4*2.5 = 10 which equals Firelfy's DPS increase), and it becomes more valuable once you have 5 stacks. This is true at all levels of Firefly and Napalm since they both scale linearly.<h4>Flaming Lasso</h4>Batrider should center around movement speed and positioning items to get the most out of his ultimate.<br/>  can be bought as a way of initiating on 2 clumped up targets, this can be devastating late game as it means batrider can effectively pull two targets out of position.
<br/>This item also causes Flaming Lasso to deal 100 damage per second, adding more total damage due to its longer duration at higher ranks.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Chen is a support who is one of the strongest junglers in the game, and can use his persuaded creeps (thanks to Holy Persuasion) to gank and push very early in a game. Chen is able to weaken his adversaries with his Penitence, and can heal all allies and neutral creeps under his control with Hand of God. His reliance on micromanagement and map awareness makes him a difficult hero to master, but utilized properly Chen has the ability to gain a powerful early advantage for his team, which can allow them to decisively end matches quickly.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Natural jungler.<br/>Global Heal.<br/>Most effective pusher in early stage of the game.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very micro-intensive<br/>Very hard to play<br/>If not played properly will make enemies gain significant gold advantages.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While Chen is a force to be reckoned with in the early game, he loses much of his potency in the late game. Because Chen depends on the strength of his creeps to overpower enemy heroes and push down towers in the early game, his greatest weakness is to allow the enemy to get enough farm and levels to easily deal with his creeps, rendering them useless. As such, Chen must attempt to gain a powerful early lead for his team, and try to crush the enemy before they become strong enough to simply farm his creeps and turn them into a liability.<br/>Chen is usually played as a jungler, as Holy Persuasion allows him to convert a neutral creep to do his bidding. The creep can be used to farm other neutral camps, using its auto-attacks and abilities to kill other neutrals while tanking their attacks to keep Chen safe. As well, the neutral creep can use its active ability to assist Chen in ganking the enemy, on top of adding its attacks to deal more damage to the gank target.<br/>Using Holy Persuasion on an enemy creep in conjunction with the teleport part of Test of Faith it is possible to send an enemy hero teleporting to that creep into your fountain.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Penitence</h4>Penitence applies a debuff to the target enemy unit, slowing them while inflicting them with damage amplification.<br/>Depending on team composition, Penitence can be a strong debuff to cast on an enemy during a gank. It can stack alongside other slows, preventing the target from easily escaping, while also increasing the amount of damage the target takes from allied attacks and nukes.<br/>An early level of Penitence can help increase the odds of a successful kill when Chen rotates to gank enemies with the help of his creeps, as it as a very long cast range and the slow and damage amplification can make a big difference. However, keep in mind that since it is a percentage-based debuff, it is not as effective in the early game. Early skill points should be put into Test of Faith and Holy Persuasion in order to allow Chen to do more in the early game.<br/>In teamfights, try to cast Penitence on high-priority enemies, since the slow can hinder their positioning and the damage amplification can help make them easier to focus down by your teammates. At max level the spell has a 72% up time, allowing it to greatly hinder enemies at all times during prolonged engagements.<br/>While the slow is not very strong compared to those possessed by other heroes, Penitence can be cast as a slow debuff to aid escaping teammates. The spell's long cast range allows it to be used from relative safety, and can hinder enemies that are trying to pursue a weakened teammate.<h4>Test of Faith</h4>Test of Faith is a random-damage nuke that allows Chen to deal Pure damage to enemies.<br/>While it is generally not reliable, Test of Faith should be Chen's second-priority spell to max out after Holy Persuasion. Being able to contribute an additional damage nuke during a gank can make a big difference, and the spell's level also affects the effectiveness of the teleport sub-ability.<br/>Remember that Test of Faith is a Pure damage nuke, and thus interacts differently from most other damage nukes. While it cannot take advantage of magic resistance debuffs such as Ancient Seal or Natural Order, it also ignores enemy magic shields and any abilities that provide them with bonus magic resistance, making it strong against abilities like Spell Shield, Berserker's Blood and Flame Guard.<br/>Test of Faith is best used in conjunction alongside Penitence, as Penitence will amplify the power of all damage types, including Pure. As well, beware Test of Faith's long cooldown, which prevents it from being used more than once or twice in a gank or teamfight.<h4>Test of Faith</h4>Test of Faith (Teleport)} allows Chen to send an allied unit back to his team's fountain, with a delay when sending a hero back. It also allows Chen to summon all converted creeps to his side after the same delay.<br/>Test of Faith's teleport is mainly used to save teammates that are in danger of being killed by the enemy. If an ally's life is threatened, immediately casting Test of Faith on them can increase their chances of surviving, only requiring them to evade the enemy for a few more seconds.<br/>Using Test of Faith to send Chen's creeps back to his team's fountain has many uses. Saving a creep and sending it back to base can allow Chen to continue to use it, as certain creeps can be hard to find in the jungle. As well, returning a creep to base can be a useful way to re-position it, as it can then walk to its destination more safely and possibly faster than if it began its journey from Chen's location.<br/>Beware Test of Faith's heavy mana cost. Because Chen is so reliant on casting spells in order to be effective, it can be hard to ensure that Chen has enough mana to cast all of his abilities, particularly his ultimate.<br/>When cast on himself, Test of Faith allows Chen to summon his congregation to his current position after a short delay. This can be important for gathering his creeps to prepare for a gank or push, or to prevent the enemy from farming them for gold and experience.<h4>Holy Persuasion</h4>Holy Persuasion is Chen's signature ability, allowing him to convert non-friendly creeps, whether they are enemy or neutral, to fight by his side. It also increases the converted unit's maximum HP if it is below the spell's threshold.<br/>Taken at level 1, Holy Persuasion is what allows Chen to be one of the strongest junglers in the game. Given a source of mana replenishment, Chen can farm safely and reliably in order to get levels and gold to become effective. It is the best spell to max out first as Chen, as each additional level allows Chen to control more creeps simultaneously and increases the survivability of weaker creeps.<br/>The key to playing Chen effectively is to be active immediately from the start, using converted creeps to farm, stack neutral camps, harass the enemy in-lane, scout enemy movement, and disable enemies during ganks. In the laning phase, neutral creeps can be much stronger than heroes, and when massed together or using their abilities can be a force to be reckoned with.<br/>Assigning command groups to converted creeps allows them to be micromanaged and issued individual commands or moved as a group. Proper management of Chen's creeps is crucial for playing the hero effectively.<br/>Remember that creeps can not only provide attack power and abilities in fights, they can be used to body-block enemies to prevent them from chasing or running away as effectively. If the opportunity presents itself, try to use your creeps to hinder the enemy's movements.<br/>Like other controllable units, creeps can provide very strong benefits to Chen's team no matter their abilities or survivability. They can be moved around to scout enemy movement and provide vision, extremely useful at night, or can be used to safely check inside Roshan's pit. As with body-blocking enemy heroes' movements, they can also get in the way of enemy spells as well, such as Sacred Arrow, Fatal Bonds and Meat Hook.<br/>Conversely, beware of enemies that can take advantage of the creeps' numbers and turn them against him. An Echo Slam or Overwhelming Odds can deal heavy damage to allied heroes by using the creeps as additional multipliers, Astral Spirit can absorb additional attack damage and movement speed for Elder Titan, Sleight of Fist can deal large amounts of cleave damage if Ember Spirit has a Battle Fury, and so on. Beware of what abilities enemy heroes have that can counter your creeps, and plan accordingly.<br/> While creeps from small camps have low damage, they can be quite powerful if their abilities are used properly. However, the existence of only one small camp in each jungle makes obtaining a specific creep unlikely, on top of the small creep camp usually being used to pull lane creeps.
<br/>The Kobold Foreman from the Kobold Camp or Hill Troll and Kobold Camp can be a useful utility creep to provide increased movement speed to Chen and his creeps. The aura can help initiation creeps to close the distance faster, or allow them to traverse to their destination more efficiently.<br/>The Hill Troll Priest from the Hill Troll Camp is a useful utility creep for the early game. Its mana aura can help keep Chen and his creeps' mana topped up, as well as that of teammates, and the heal can be extremely helpful for keeping Chen's congregation alive and for healing Chen himself and his teammates, increasing their survivability in the laning stage.<br/>The Ghost from the Ghost Camp can inflict a slow on its target, reducing their movement speed and potentially allowing Chen and his team to catch up to fleeing enemies and hit them with harder disables.<br/>The Harpy Stormcrafter from the Harpy Camp possesses the Chain Lightning ability, which deals a surprising amount of damage at low mana cost and cooldown. It is an extremely powerful harasser and pusher, as it can apply a large amount of magic nuke damage to an enemy and force them out of the lane. The nuke can also be used to farm neutral camps or push lanes to take towers.<br/> Each jungle has two medium camps, which contain some useful creeps with strong abilities.
<br/>The Centaur Conqueror from the Centaur Camp is one of the most well-rounded creeps, as its high HP makes it a beefy fighter and War Stomp allows it to stun enemy heroes for 2 seconds each. Amassing multiple Centaur Conquerors allows Chen to push very strongly, or to chain-stun an enemy with consecutive stomps.<br/>The Alpha Wolf from the Wolf Camp can be a strong creep to obtain in the mid and late game. Its Packleader's Aura can greatly boost your carry's damage output based on their base damage, giving your team an advantage in fights.<br/>The Satyr Banisher from the Satyr Camp and Large Satyr Camp is a surprisingly strong creep that possesses a strong utility ability. Converting the Banisher will more than double its HP, negating its low natural health. Its Purge can be used either to remove debuffs from Chen's allies or Chen himself, or to greatly slow an enemy every five seconds while also removing buffs.<br/>The Satyr Mindstealer from the same neutral camps is a useful harassment creep. While its Mana Burn has a respectably long cooldown, it costs very little mana to cast, allowing to be used to whittle down an enemy's mana and HP repeatedly, forcing them to return to base.<br/>The Ogre Frostmage from the Ogre Camp is a very useful defensive creep that can be useful depending on both teams' lineups. Its Ice Armor ability (not to be confused with that of Lich) provides additional armor to allies and reduces the effectiveness of enemy melee attacks due to the attack speed slow. It can be a powerful creep to have if your team has several heroes that can benefit from additional armor such as Huskar and Phoenix, or if the enemy has melee carries that depend on their right-clicks to win fights. As well, the armor can make pushes more effective by providing lane creeps and Chen's flock with additional armor to tank creep attacks and tower hits.<br/>Mud Golems from the Golem Camp provide beefiness and a short-interval disable. Hurl Boulder inflicts a short-duration stun at long range, useful for cancelling channeled enemy abilities, hindering a foe long enough to hit them with a longer duration disable, or breaking Linken's Sphere. The Mud Golem can also split into two Shard Golems, which can further disable an enemy with the same disable.<br/> Large camps contain the most powerful creeps short of ancient creeps, many of which can be utilized to great purpose.
<br/>The Satyr Tormenter from the Large Satyr Camp is a useful nuking and harassing creep. While it is very slow, its Shockwave can be used to harass down enemies during the laning stage, and can also be used to nuke down creep waves and neutral camps. As well, its Unholy Aura can be a very strong pushing aura, as it provides HP regen to Chen (stacks with other HP regen auras including Helm of the Dominator) , his congregation, and any nearby lane creeps attempting to take a tower.<br/>The Hellbear Smasher from the Hellbear Camp is a beefy fighter that can be useful as a disabler and pusher. Its Thunder Clap can be used to slow gank targets, making them easier to chase and hit with unreliable disables, or as a damage nuke to farm or push. Its Swiftness Aura increases the attack speed of allied units, allowing lane creeps to deal more damage during a push.<br/>The Wildwing Ripper from the Wildwing Camp can be used as a nuker, harasser and pusher. By channeling a Tornado, Chen can either slowly whittle down a neutral camp that has been stacked multiple times, harass an enemy with an invulnerable tornado, or work down lane creeps during a push. The Wildwing Ripper's Toughness Aura also provides armor to all nearby creeps, increasing their physical toughness.<br/>The Dark Troll Summoner from the Troll Camp is a well-balanced disabler, farmer and pusher. Of all neutral creeps, it possesses one of the strongest disables, as Ensnare is a ranged single-target disable that can root through spell immunity, making it a powerful ganking spell. It can also summon minions with Raise Dead, allowing Chen to jungle more effectively or provide extra pushing power.<br/> Ancient creeps can only be converted if Chen possesses an Aghanim's Scepter, and even then only based on how many levels of Hand of God he has. However, they are significantly more powerful than other creeps.
<br/>Ancient creeps generally have high magic resistance, letting them shrug off most enemy nukes, and the Ancient classification allows them to ignore many abilities. As such, bringing ancient creeps to a fight can provide a powerful advantage since the enemy will be unable to kill them as easily, if at all.<br/>The Ancient Black Dragon from the Dragon Camp can be used as a powerful pusher. Its Splash Attack can make short work of creep waves, while its Dragonhide Aura can give nearby allies an armor bonus. Fireball is a powerful damage-over-time ability that can be used for pushing or zoning out enemies.<br/>The Ancient Granite Golem from the Large Golem Camp possesses one of the most powerful auras available to Chen, increasing the maximum health of all nearby units by 15% with its Granite Aura. Applying the aura to Chen's teammates can make them much harder to kill in teamfights.<br/>The Ancient Thunderhide from the Thunderhide Camp can be a formidable pusher. Its War Drums Aura increases the physical damage output of all nearby allies through bonus damage and attack speed, and it can cast Frenzy to further boost its own attack speed, allowing it to make short work of enemy creeps.<br/>The Ancient Prowler Shaman from the Prowler Camp has less health than most Ancients and lacks magic resistance, but is very powerful against enemy heroes. Desecrate applies an armor debuff in an area to bolster allies' physical damage output, and Petrify provides a Spell Immunity-piercing root that can be lethal in a teamfight or gank.<br/>The Ancient Prowler Acolyte, also from the Prowler Camp, has little offensive presence and is relatively fragile, but the bonus lifesteal and health regeneration from Prowler Aura can greatly enhance allies' survivability.<br/>Always remember that Chen's creeps do not always have to be at his side, and that they can still be controlled even if Chen himself is dead. Be sure to take advantage of this in order to accomplish as much with the creeps as possible.<br/>Remember that Holy Persuasion increases the maximum HP of smaller creeps, giving them more survivability in fights and ganks. It can be worthwhile to convert small creeps with special abilities, as they can accomplish more due to their increased HP.<br/>If possible, try to avoid allowing the enemy to kill Chen's creeps. Not only does this provide the enemy with gold and experience, but Chen will be forced to find another creep to convert, wasting time and mana. Each of Chen's creeps must ultimately serve a purpose for his team, so losing them to the enemy can set him back considerably depending on its role.<br/>Be especially wary of certain heroes that can make short work of Chen's creeps. Heroes that can instantly destroy them like Clinkz, Doom, Enigma Lifestealer can remove them from play virtually instantly, and benefit from killing the creeps as well. As well, Enchantress can simply take control of Chen's creeps and use them against him, and Lion can render them impotent by removing their mana pool.<br/>During the jungling phase, it can sometimes be worthwhile to convert weaker creeps to Chen's side rather than the largest one available. Keep in mind that a converted creep provides no gold or experience for Chen, and while it can be better utilized for farming, converting it also denies Chen the maximum possible gold and experience gain from that camp.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Crystal Maiden is an efficient support who specializes in slowing enemies. Her highly valued Arcane Aura increases mana regeneration for all her teammates, while she remains effective throughout the game with very little items. In large fights, she can channel a Freezing Field to obliterate enemies over a wide area, along with using Frostbite to target individuals. However, Crystal Maiden is quite fragile even compared to other supports, and is one of the slowest heroes in the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Gives team mana regeneration.<br/>Numerous slows.<br/>Not item dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low movement speed.<br/>Very fragile.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Crystal Maiden is a well-rounded support who possesses good early-game disabling and roaming capability. She is also an easy hero to learn, as her abilities are straightfoward and give her team strong disabling and nuking potential.<br/>Like most intelligence casters, Crystal Maiden is extremely squishy and easy to kill if focused down by the enemy. This is further exacerbated by her low base movement speed, tied with Invoker for the second-lowest base movement speed in the game. Due to her strong disable potential, she can most effectively mitigate this and by building mobility items that give her a measure of escape, since it doubles to give her initiation potential.<br/>Because her abilities are strongest in the laning stage of a match, Crystal Maiden can greatly aid her team by being extremely active on the map as early as possible.<br/>Crystal Maiden is most often played as her team's hard support, babysitting her safe lane carry and purchasing the support items for her team. Because she does not require farm in order to be effective, she can afford to spend most of a match with few items more than basic boots and a Town Portal Scroll.<br/>Rylai's strong disable repertoire makes her a very strong early roamer, as she can disable and nuke down enemies in order to secure kills in the laning stage.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Crystal Nova</h4>Crystal Nova is a large area of effect nuke that also slows enemies' movement and attack speed.<br/>Crystal Nova's long cast range and wide radius allows Rylai to hit enemies 1100 units away (700 casting range + 400 radius), making it a strong initiating slow that can hinder enemies' attempts to run away so that Crystal Maiden and her teammates can more easily pursue.<br/>In teamfights, cast Crystal Nova early on, as the movement speed slow can hinder enemies' movements and set up spells for teammates, while the attack speed slow can reduce their ability to fight. Its low cooldown allows Rylai to cast it multiple times over the course of an engagement, so casting it early in a teamfight will give it more time to come off cooldown to be used as a supplementary nuke and slow afterward.<br/>Crystal Nova provides ground vision in its casting radius for a short duration. This allows it to be used to scout high-ground areas, particularly for checking elevated cliffs for enemy wards or inside Roshan's pit.<h4>Frostbite</h4>Frostbite roots the target enemy while also disarming them and dealing damage over time.<br/>Frostbite can be a strong disable due to its ability to instantly immobilize an enemy. It also interrupts channeling abilities by applying a mini-stun upon cast. While it does not prevent enemies from casting spells, it can inhibit True Blink abilities, as well as Charge of Darkness and Phase Shift. Depending on the enemy lineup, maxing out Frostbite first can give Crystal Maiden's team an edge in fights.<br/>Frostbite lasts 10 seconds on creeps, no matter what level it is. This can be useful for jungling on the side as it will always deal 1,000 magic damage to neutrals, and can be useful for rooting enemy-controlled creeps during fights.<br/>Frostbite's up-time increases drastically as it is leveled, as the cooldown decreases in tandem with the disable duration's increase. At level 4, it is possible to keep an enemy rooted for 50% of the time, so staying alive in teamfights can allow Crystal Maiden to severely hinder right-clicking carries if they have no method with which to prevent her from casting it.<h4>Arcane Aura</h4>Arcane Aura provides a global aura that replenishes teammates' mana over time, with the bonus doubling for Crystal Maiden herself.<br/>Arcane Aura benefits the whole team greatly in the laning stage, as allies with strong nukes or disables can cast their spells profligately to gain a lane advantage. Even past the laning stage, at max level it restores more mana than using Arcane Boots on all teammates globally whenever it is off cooldown, which allows all allied heroes, especially those with small mana pools, to cast spells much more frequently.<br/>It is wise to get at least one level of Arcane Aura in the early game. As Rylai's low base intelligence greatly limits her ability to cast her disables during the laning stage, having some form of early mana replenishment goes a long way towards improving her ganking prowess.<br/>When choosing when to level up Arcane Aura, you should bear in mind your team's composition, as well as that of the enemy. If the enemy has numerous mana-destroying spells or your team can benefit from the mana regen in-lane, then taking at least a couple early levels can give your team the freedom to use their spells more frequently. However, bear in mind that this comes at the cost of having fewer skill points in your disables in the early game, weakening your ability to gank enemies.<h4>Freezing Field</h4>Freezing Field is a channeled spell that summons a blizzard around Crystal Maiden, greatly slowing all enemies while dealing heavy damage over time.<br/>Freezing Field is an incredibly strong area nuking spell that deals more damage the closer an enemy is. However, it can be unpredictable and can be easily interrupted by Crystal Maiden's enemies if cast at the wrong time. Freezing Field also consumes a lot of mana at higher levels, so use it sparingly.<br/>Freezing Field must be used at the right time to avoid interruption and being focused. Generally speaking, in an encounter it is best used after the initial nuking phase, when the enemy's stuns are on cooldown. If your team has an initiator with the capability to disable a group of enemies, such as Ravage or Black Hole, Freezing Field should be used in tandem with their mass disable. Using Freezing Field very often results in Rylai's death if cast out in the open, and she rarely is able to channel it for its full duration, but if she can maintain it even for a few seconds it will be useful for her team.<br/>When positioning yourself to cast your ultimate, try to utilize trees and high ground as cover if the option presents itself. By shielding yourself in the fog of war, the enemy loses the ability to use targeted stuns to interrupt you, increasing the odds of channeling the spell for a longer duration.<br/>Freezing Field can be used as a supplementary slow after Crystal Nova in a teamfight. Stacking the two slows together can reduce enemy movement speed by 50-80%, and boosted by Aghanim's Scepter can ramp up to 100% movement speed slow and -100 attack speed. Even if Freezing Field is quickly interrupted, the slows and damage can greatly inhibit the enemy and give Crystal Maiden's team an opportunity to catch the enemy with further area disables and nukes.<br/>In general, it is not recommended to level up Freezing Field every time it is available, as it is highly situational and increases drastically in mana cost as it's skilled more. However, its slow and gigantic (if unpredictable) damage can be very useful in early game, especially against enemies that lack the means to interrupt it, so taking one point in it early on and leaving it at level 1 until much later can give you access to the ultimate while preserving your mana pool and freeing up your skill points for other abilities. Overall, let your decision be informed by the enemy lineup as well as laning composition.<br/>When ganking, it is important to layer your disables, even among your own spells. While Crystal Nova's cooldown prevents it from being used too often in an engagement, Frostbite's 6 second cooldown at max level allows you to cast it twice in quick succession. The most effective way to disable a target is to Frostbite them first, and then apply Crystal Nova right before its duration ends. The slow from Crystal Nova can prevent an enemy from moving too far before Frostbite comes off of cooldown, which can be cast again before the slow debuff expires.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dark Seer is a semi-support hero, most focused on AOE Battles. He is able to farm safely due to Ion Shell which can also be used to damage his enemies. He can make himself and his allies reach incredible speeds with Surge, along with using Vacuum and Wall of Replica in conjuction with each other to initiate and deal damage using the enemies' own power.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong solo offlaner.<br/>Extremely annoying to lane against.<br/>Strong team fight presence.<br/>Excellent at escaping or disengaging.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Melee attack range.<br/>Initiation combo often requires a followup.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>If laning, be sure to harass enemies with Ion Shell by placing it on their melee creeps (for melee heroes) or ranged creeps (for ranged heroes). Additionally, placing Ion Shell on the second allied melee creep to arrive at the creep line is a good way to push the lane as well as create a moving damage-dealing creep that chases enemy heroes. This can make it hard for the enemy carry to last hit, as they have to do it under the tower and while taking damage from creep aggro and ion shell at the same time.<br/>Dark Seer can farm rapidly in lane and jungle thanks to Ion Shell. To jungle, stack the hard and medium camps several times, and then place an ion shell on one of the lesser creeps. The shell should clear out the whole camp(including the stacks). Do this repeatedly to accumulate a large sum of gold. However, be sure to stay within experience range.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Vacuum</h4>Due to Vacuum being able to clump up a large group of enemies fast, and Ion Shell's high damage output considering enemies are affected by it for a longer while, they permit Dark Seer to synergize extremely well with heroes such as Enigma and Jakiro. Make sure to cast these abilities with Black Hole and Ice Path/ Macropyre/ Liquid Fire to maximize AoE damage and maybe turn the tide in battle.<br/>AoE spells, especially those that require positioning, greatly benefit from Vacuum, as it can place all of them together to ensure a hit.<h4>Ion Shell</h4>When chasing, self-cast Ion Shell and run next to the enemy without attacking, using Surge if the enemy is faster. Even better, use surge to body-block enemy heroes (that is, get in front of them to hinder their movement) and deal damage with basic attacks without moving out of range of the Ion Shell.<h4>Surge</h4>Surge can be cast on the team's Animal Courier, allowing it to get out of danger, or finish its delivery to allies faster.<br/>While normally pushing the lane is a bad thing, Surge and his high Strength gain makes it hard for the enemies to lock down Dark Seer and kill him.<h4>Wall of Replica</h4>Using Vacuum on enemy heroes to send them through Wall of Replica disallows foes from preventing illusions, as well as causing guaranteed damage from passing through the Wall.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dazzle is a support hero most well known for his ability to save his teammates from death using Shallow Grave as well as his physical damage-focused spells. He can slow and later stun single targets with Poison Touch, heal and harm with Shadow Wave, and increase and decrease the armor of his allies and enemies respectively using Weave. His item-independent nature allows him to be played as a hard support and remain effective at all stages of the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Low cooldown ultimate.<br/>Capable of making clutch saves.<br/>Does not require items to perform role.<br/>Strong 5-man enabler.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Offensive spells deal physical damage.<br/>Requires attentiveness and good timing during big team fights.<br/>Not particularly durable himself.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Due to Dazzle's potent defensive abilities, teamfights tend to last longer than usual.<br/>Dazzles abilities require him to be close to his teammates at all times.<br/>Like most intelligence support casters, Dazzle suffers from poor strength and agility, rendering him very weak against all types of damage and making him an easy kill. However, his strength is that he has very high intelligence growth, meaning that he greatly benefits from building scaling mana regen items that maintain his mana pool and facilitate continued use of his low-cooldown spells.<br/>Like all other casting-focused heroes, be particularly mindful of silences that the enemy may attempt to cast on Dazzle during engagements. As a hard support, Dazzle will not always have the gold to purchase items to dispel debuffs from himself, so long-duration silences can easily prevent him from casting his spells to save his teammates in fights.<br/>Because of his ability to save teammates from certain death, Dazzle greatly benefits from building items that aid in his positioning or allow him to cast his spells more easily. As well, this ability to save teammates' lives also means that Dazzle himself may become a priority target for the enemy team to eliminate from the battlefield. Mobility items can kill two birds with one stone, allowing Dazzle to re-position to cast his spells on his teammates, or to quickly escape enemy attempts on his life.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Poison Touch</h4>Poison Touch deals an increasing slow on a target enemy, then deals physical damage over time.<br/>Poison Touch is a strong ganking spell, as its respectable cast range and slow duration can allow allies to quickly close in to land stronger disables on a gank target. At least one value point is recommended in all situations, as the slow can also be useful for fending off enemies trying to pursue teammates.<br/>At max level, Poison Touch inflicts a 1 second stun on its target 2 seconds after the projectile impacts. While this prevents Dazzle from easily interrupting enemy channels (particularly Town Portal Scroll), the spell's cooldown eventually reduces to less than half of the initial 15 seconds, allowing the debuff to be active on an enemy at all times.<br/>Due to its damage over time nature, Poison Touch can be useful for inhibiting enemy Blink Daggers. Even if they create enough distance to escape immediate incoming damage from Dazzle and his team, their Blink Dagger will be disabled for at least 13 seconds after the spell is cast. However, be mindful that Poison Touch itself deals no damage for the first two slow instances, so try to inflict the target with a source of player-based damage prior to casting Poison Touch.<h4>Shallow Grave</h4>Shallow Grave, Dazzle's signature spell, places an unpurgeable buff on an ally that prevents them from dying due to damage for the next 5 seconds.<br/>At least one value point in Shallow Grave is recommended no matter how Dazzle is skilled. The ability to prevent an ally's death for 5 seconds can completely change gank and teamfight outcomes, allowing a teammate to survive a situation in which they would otherwise die.<br/>In general, it is best to cast Shallow Grave on a target just before they receive a killing blow. Casting Shallow Grave too early can waste some of its duration on a teammate who still has some health left, as the spell is only truly useful if it prevents damage that would otherwise kill the target. However, be mindful that the spell has a longer cast animation than the rest of Dazzle's abilities, require 0.4 seconds to cast instead of 0.3. Keep in mind the enemy team's composition and their ability to deal sudden burst damage, and when in doubt casting earlier is better than later.<br/>Shallow Grave is Dazzle's most expensive ability, costing 150 mana at all levels. While leveling it up will not increase its mana cost, doing so also means that the rest of Dazzle's abilities will be weaker at each respective level. Know when to prioritize leveling Dazzle's other spells first, depending on the situation.<br/>When deciding when to level up Shallow Grave, keep in mind how active you expect both teams to be throughout a match. If the enemy has a gank-heavy lineup and intends to make numerous attempts to take early teamfights or kill your teammates in ganks, maxing out Shallow Grave early can frustrate their attempts to secure kills, buying your team time and space to farm up items to defeat them later. If your team expects to take the initiative and fight early on against a greedy farming lineup, Shallow Grave can be left at a single level and saved during calculated ganks and fights, allowing Dazzle to expend his skill points on other offensive spells.<br/>Keep in mind that Shallow Grave can be cast offensively as well as defensively. Holding Shallow Grave in reserve can allow teammates to dive enemy towers in the early game and extend farther than otherwise possible, in the knowledge that Shallow Grave can be cast to cover their retreat.<br/>Be mindful that allies affected by Shallow Grave are only prevented from dying during the spell; when the duration ends they are left with however much health they have and can be easily finished off by pursuing enemies. Try to use healing abilities and items on teammates just before the spell expires, but not too early so as not to waste the heal during the spell.<br/>Combined with a Town Portal Scroll, Shallow Grave can be used as an escape spell provided that the enemy has no interrupting disables. If Dazzle or an ally encounter a hopeless situation and the enemy has expended their disables, casting Shallow Grave and then teleporting back to base can be a life-saver; enemies will be unable to kill or interrupt the target during the teleport channel, and they can emerge back at base and heal back to full health. However, beware of damage-over-time spells like Dual Breath that could otherwise finish the job in the fountain, as well as global damage nukes that can finish off low-health targets before they can fully recover like Sun Strike and Thundergod's Wrath.<br/>Because it uses the pre-heal mechanic, Shallow Grave will always set a target's health to be exactly 1 point higher than any damage instance that would otherwise kill them. This means that while Blade Mail will still continue to reflect damage during the buff, it also means that damage from abilities like Fatal Bonds can still be spread to the target's allies.<br/>The cast range of Shallow Grave increases with each level; it starts out the same range as your normal attack, but at level 4 goes to almost twice that distance. Higher levels of Shallow Grave not only reduce the cooldown, but allow Dazzle to save his allies from farther away.<h4>Shadow Wave</h4>Shadow Wave instantly heals the target allied unit alongside a number of other allied units in an area, while dealing physical damage in a small radius around each heal target.<br/>Despite its small numbers, Shadow Wave is a very strong healing spell as its extremely low cooldown allows it to be spammed over short periods of time and heal multiple allies at once. Maxing it out early can give Dazzle's team a strong survivability advantage in early teamfights while simultaneously increasing his physical damage output.<br/>Each ally healed by Shadow Wave will deal an instance of damage in a small radius around themselves. This means that if multiple allies are clustered around an enemy unit at melee range, that enemy will be hit with multiple instances of physical damage. This makes Shadow Wave a very strong offensive spell when combined with teammates who can summon crowds of units to attack enemies at melee range, such as Broodmother, Phantom Lancer and Meepo.<br/>Because it heals and damages in larger numbers with crowded allies, Shadow Wave is particularly strong at defending and pushing lanes due to lane creeps being present in large numbers and fighting at melee range. A single cast of Shadow Wave can deal significant damage to enemy creep waves, allowing Dazzle to destroy a single wave in two casts of the spell.<br/>If not targeting himself, Dazzle is always added as a unit for healing and damaging for Shadow Wave. This can be useful for adding an extra instance of damage in fights and ganks, provided that Dazzle can position himself close to the enemy target, and can be useful for bouncing Shadow Wave's damage to enemy ranged and siege creeps when pushing lanes.<h4>Weave</h4>Weave applies a buff to allies and a debuff to enemies within its radius, increasing allied armor and decreasing enemy armor over time.<br/>Weave is a very strong teamfight ultimate since it can hearten allies for battle before a teamfight or give the enemy pause before they engage. As the respective buff and debuff cannot be purged by either side, the enemy will be unable to counter its effects should they decide to fight, and allies will get progressively stronger or enemies weaker the longer a teamfight progresses.<br/>Due to its gradual nature, it is best to try to cast Weave as early as possible before teamfights, as the armor shift is very small at the start of the spell's duration but grows to become extremely impactful after just a few seconds.<br/>Because it is most impactful after it has run its course for at least a few seconds, Weave can only practically be cast either on Dazzle's team to buff allied armor or on the opposing team to weaken enemy armor; it is inadvised to attempt to cast Weave when both teams have already engaged in battle as it will have minimal effect. If the enemy has strong survivability or Dazzle's team has good physical damage output, casting Weave on the enemy will take away their survivability advantage or allow Dazzle's allies to capitalize on their stronger carry potential. However, if the opposing team has strong damage output or Dazzle's team has weak armor, placing the buff on Dazzle's team can allow them to engage in fights undaunted. Always take the respective team compositions and gold/experience leads into account when deciding who to most profitably cast Weave on.<br/>Weave's wide radius makes it the perfect spell for breaking up Roshan attempts by the enemy team. As Roshan's pit is very cramped, it is easy to hit the entire enemy team with the debuff while revealing the inside of the pit. This can either force the enemy to break off and retreat, or risk being destroyed and losing the Aegis to Dazzle's team.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Death Prophet is a powerful spellcaster, who has wide Area of Effect (AoE) spells which specialize in pushing lanes and also devastating enemy defensive towers quickly in order to enter their enemy base, to gain victory within a short period of time. Exorcism can devastate towers in a short period of time, while also being a great ability for teamfights. To keep herself alive, she can use Silence and Spirit Siphon to remain active while still dealing damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can push lanes and destroy towers quickly.<br/>High survivability.<br/>High base movement speed allows her to chase enemies.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Lack of escape ability.<br/>Long cast animation besides Spirit Siphon.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Death Prophet is best played in the middle lane, easily farming up gold for her items with careful use of Crypt Swarm. Be cautious though as pushing too much with the area damage can leave Krobelus open to ganks, from which her only means of defense is Spirit Siphon, which is never guaranteed to ensure her survival.<br/>All of Krobelus' spells are area of effect, excluding Spirit Siphon. This means that they cannot be blocked by Linken's Sphere, and while Spirit Siphon can be negated by it, its multiple charges and lack of cooldown between their usage can allow you to quickly break the shield and apply a tether, assuming you have charges to spare.<br/>As Death Prophet is good in pushing lanes, keep in mind that in early stage when pushing your lane creeps too near their enemy base or defensive towers they can safe farm without worrying because the distance between their base are shorter, they can use Town Portal Scroll to defend their towers and kill your pushing lane creeps, which allows the enemy side to quickly build their items too.<br/>Try to not stay alone when wonders around the enemy jungle camps, although Death Prophet has high base movement speed, she lacks escape abilities. One hard disable can brings you down if there is no reinforcements nearby.<br/>In a large clash, Krobelus should be swooping around silencing and nuking enemy supports while eroding their health with Exorcism. Carries almost unfailingly have higher armor than supports, and since Exorcism is physical damage, her damage potential is highest when she focuses on the supports.<br/>Given her above-average base movement speed and Phase Boots, Krobelus moves extremely fast and can often avoid damage simply by being faster than her aggressor. A Eul's Scepter of Divinity is also a common pickup on her and increases her movement speed to phenomenal levels. Krobelus tends to chase people around a lot with Exorcism, so high movement speed is a must and can also help the spirits damage enemies around Krobelus while she is safe.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Crypt Swarm</h4>Crypt Swarm is a very powerful area of effect nuke which damages enemies in a cone-shaped area. Its power falls off later in the game, but it can still clear creep waves with two uses, between which the cooldown should be very short at that point.<br/>The target range of Crypt Swarm is 600 but it can travel up to 1110 range maximum, do not hesitate to harass laning enemy heroes to force them to retreat to their defensive towers.<br/>Crypt Swarm is a dual sided target ability that can be targeted both onto a unit or the ground. Usually it is much easier to target the ground due to the short casting range of the spell.<br/>Crypt Swarm can be used to kill enemy lane creeps with ease, as well as to prevent the enemy from denying them as the damage is higher than any hero's basic attacks during the early game. At the same time it can harass the enemy hero with some clever positioning.<br/>Although Crypt Swarm has large area of effect, some enemy heroes can easily avoid Crypt Swarm by just looking at your long cast animation. Mid heroes like Puck (using Phase Shift) or Templar Assassin (using Refraction) can easily nullify your damage.<br/>Since Crypt Swarm has a low cooldown and is also spamable, though as the skill level goes higher, the mana consumption will increase as well. Try to maintain your mana by avoiding careless use of the ability in the laning phrase.<br/>Crypt Swarm is typically maxed first as it is a very strong AoE nuke with low cooldown, followed by Spirit Siphon, which helps her sustain in lane and survive teamfights.<h4>Silence</h4>Silence is a powerful utility disable which prevent enemies from casting spells for up to 6 seconds at max level.<br/>Silence has a nice long 900 cast range which can safely be cast at far distances and also has a big 425 area of effect, try to silence as many heroes as possible. The long range silence are also great to cancel powerful channeling ultimate abilities such as Black Hole, Fiend's Grip, Freezing Field and Death Ward, provided that they are not affected by spell immunity.<br/>Some players might take one level of Silence during laning phase or early team fights, especially when facing hard spellcaster heroes that interrupt your action so she can secure a kill easily.<br/>Remember that Silence can be dispelled by enemies, smart players can purchase dispel items such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity, Guardian Greaves, Diffusal Blade to remove the silence debuff. But silence is also a great way to forcing them to activate Black King Bar if they have it inside their inventory, so they will use it to dispel Silence, making them less protection during team fights.<br/>Silence also good against those self powerful buff heroes like Ursa's Overpower, Enrage and Lifestealer's Rage which requires their spell to cast, just make sure that you inflict them with silence before they cast it.<br/>Put a single point in Silence early if the enemy is reliant on spell casting, such as Dazzle, Leshrac or Lion.<h4>Spirit Siphon</h4>Spirit Siphon is a powerful pseudo lifesteal that drains the enemy's health for a short period of time. Draining enemies' health lets Death Prophet sustain longer during team fights.<br/>The sprite animation of Spirit Siphon works similar to Pugna's Life Drain. Unlike Pugna, she can move freely during drain until the target enemy moves outside of the break range of 750, the drain duration ends or the enemy dies. Drain and healing will continue even if the target or Death Prophet becomes disabled or invulnerable. Smart players can predict enemies movement with slow animation disables like Storm Hammer or Wraithfire Blast to recover the damage taken.<br/>The health drain scales with the target enemy's max HP. The more HP that enemy is, the more health you will be drain. Thee health drain scales with the enemy's max HP, but the damage type is magical which is affected by magic resistance, resulted as draining 4.125% max HP (when maxed, with standard 25% magic resistance heroes) per second when targeting heroes, except Roshan (you cannot target it).<br/>Spirit Siphon is a charge-based spell like Earth Spirit's Stone Remnant that can store up to 4 charges at max level. Besides level 1, you can cast on a single enemy after the duration finishes and cast it again without waiting for a cooldown unless you had one charge left. Keep in mind that Spirit Siphon needs 45 seconds to replenish a charge so use it wisely, without Spirit Siphon most likely you might not survive during team fights.<br/>Spirit Siphon can be cast on multiple targets at once, provided enough charges are available, allowing Krobelus to replenish health very rapidly if she is standing in the middle of the enemy team.<br/>Spirit Siphon also comes with a slow which, while not very heavy, can still allow you to catch up to enemies much easier, or escape from them.<h4>Exorcism</h4>Exorcism is a fantastic pushing ultimate that can easily take down towers and Roshan if left unhindered. Fighting into an activated Exorcism is quite dangerous as well, which means hindering her is not easy.<br/>Always remember Exorcism's damage is physical, hence, Armor reduction increases its damage. Focusing on targets with low armor (Intelligence and many Strength heroes) yields the best result of Exorcism. That said, its damage is a threat even to targets with very high armor, and those carrying a Black King Bar.<br/>Remember that the Exorcism spirits have a travel time and after each attack must return to Krobelus. The closer you stand to a target, the less the spirits have to travel, thus dealing more overall damage.<br/>Use Exorcism as early as it is practically possible for clashes, as the sooner it is cast the sooner her spirits will return and heal her. Her spirits will easily harvest enough life to restore her HP entirely, and the conclusion of her ultimate can save Krobelus' life; as well as severely endanger the lives of her adversaries as she returns to battle with full health.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Disruptor is a strong teamfight hero who can control the enemy team's positioning with his potent disables. His Kinetic Field can prevent enemies from leaving the area after being set up, and when used in conjunction with Static Storm can silence and disrupt enemies for extended periods. While he lacks nuking power, he can influence the battlefield in such a way as to greatly hinder the enemy in engagements and prevent gank targets from escaping with Glimpse.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great at catching and ganking heroes.<br/>Strong team fight spells.<br/>Relatively item independent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Poor stats growth.<br/>Mediocre nuke spell.<br/>Needs good timing to get skills off.<br/>He's useless when enemy is magic immune.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Generally Disruptor is played as a hard support, as he does not require farm in order to perform well. As well, he can be a powerful roamer as his spells can influence enemy positioning, setting up kills for teammates if they have strong damage output.<br/>One of Disruptor's biggest strengths is his extremely short cast animation, which combined with the long cast range on his spells can make him a force to be reckoned with. Positioning is very important for Disruptor, as exploiting these two aspects of the hero allows him to have a very powerful impact on any engagement.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Thunder Strike</h4>Thunder Strike is a damage-over-time magic nuke that reveals the target's location for the duration of the spell.<br/>The damage that Thunder Strike deals is minuscule in the early game, and lacks immediate killing power even when maxed out. However, it also provides vision of the target for its duration, so long as the target is not invisible. This can be very useful for preventing them from juking, as well as giving vision of them to target them with Glimpse.<br/>Keep in mind that Thunder Strike will deal nuke damage to all enemies within a small radius around the target as well. If using the spell to nuke creep waves or neutral camps, it is best to cast it on a melee creep, as they will clump up near other melee creeps while attacking, resulting in all of them taking the damage.<br/>Thunder Strike can be a powerful counter to Blink Dagger if it can be cast before the enemy reacts. By taking advantage of Thunder Strike's long cast range, it can prevent enemies from using their Blink Dagger for at least 9 seconds. (6 seconds for the duration of Thunder Strike, and 3 more for the cooldown) This can be used either to stop initiators from jumping on top of your team for a time, or prevent gank targets from easily escaping.<h4>Glimpse</h4>Glimpse is one of Disruptor's most potent disables, as it can forcibly re-position an enemy, putting them in a location that your team can capitalize on.<br/>Glimpse can be extremely tricky to use, as the enemy's previous movements must be taken into account in order to maximize its effect. As such, timing is extremely important as casting it too early or too late can move a target only a small distance, or put them in a location of safety.<br/>Keep in mind that Glimpse has a relatively short cast range at early levels, and its long cooldown means that it can only be used once in an engagement. However, maxing the spell out allows Disruptor to cast it on any hero within visual range, and its cooldown shortens to the point where it can be cast up to twice in fights. Maxing out Glimpse early on can provide strong benefits for Disruptor's team due to this greatly enhanced utility.<br/>Thunder Strike is a very powerful spell to use in combination with Glimpse, as it provides vision of the target, ensuring that Glimpse can be cast on them so long as they are within its cast range.<br/>In tandem with the above, Thunder Strike's damage interval can be used to assist with the timing for casting Glimpse. Thunder Strike's third damage instance happens exactly 4 seconds after cast, so casting Glimpse on the target at the same time as that damage instance will send the target to the place where they were standing when Thunder Strike was first cast on them.<br/>One very strong aspect of Glimpse is that its effects are global, and there is no maximum range on how far back it can send its target; if an enemy is teleporting in with a Town Portal Scroll, Glimpse can send them straight back to their previous location, even if it was across the map. However, keep in mind that while this can be used to prevent reinforcements against tower dives or pushes, the target will still have 1.8 seconds to act before being sent back, so they can still cast high-impact spells at their destination for a short time.<br/>Glimpsed targets are issued stop commands at the end of its effect, effectively allowing it to be used to cancel channeled spells and items. Because of this, Glimpse can be used to interrupt Town Portal Scrolls by enemies attempting to escape or reinforce their allies, or halt channeled abilities such as Black Hole, Death Ward and Freezing Field.<br/>If the target of a Glimpse is an illusion, it will be instantly destroyed. This can be useful for instantly removing certain illusions from the field, such as Replicate, Haunt and so on.<br/>Glimpse can re-position even hidden or invulnerable targets, with certain exceptions. This makes it a powerful spell against certain evasive heroes, as it can return heroes through abilities like Phase Shift, Ball Lightning and Waveform.<br/>While Glimpse cannot return targets to their previous location through spell immunity, it can be a powerful spell for forcing the enemy to activate Black King Bar. By catching them with Glimpse, the enemy can be forced to activate their BKB at an inopportune time or be killed. Even if the kill is missed, this can reduce its maximum duration, or put it on cooldown ahead of a major engagement.<h4>Kinetic Field</h4>Kinetic Field is a powerful movement inhibitor that, used properly, can lock down multiple enemy heroes for a short duration, allowing them to be easily brought down by allied nukes.<br/>Glimpse is the perfect combo spell to set up Kinetic Field with. As Glimpse will mark the target's arrival destination upon cast, Kinetic Field can be cast upon that position to ensure that the target is locked inside after being pulled back.<br/>Keep in mind that Kinetic Field has a 1.2 second delay before the barrier forms, so it is possible for enemies with good movement speed or quick reaction times to escape capture. In order to prevent this, a leading disable is extremely helpful as it can immobilize a target long enough for the field to materialize.<br/>In teamfights, Kinetic Field can split the battlefield and foil the enemy's attempts to get in position to cast their spells. Even if no actual enemy players are caught within, stopping rear-line supports from joining the fight can make a significant difference. Try to use the terrain to your advantage, such as chokepoints and cliffs.<br/>Kinetic Field provides ground vision within the barrier for the duration of the spell. As such, it can be used to reveal the fog of war, such as up high ground or behind trees.<br/>While enemies can cast re-positioning spells to escape the barrier, Force Staff cannot be used to break out (though enemies can still be pushed in). This makes Kinetic Field unique among lockdown spells, as the enemy will have fewer options for escaping the field. As well, while spell immunity will allow enemies to simply walk through the walls, the spell will directly manipulate their movement speed rather than act as an obstacle, meaning that spells such as Duel can be foiled by preventing melee targets from passing through.<h4>Static Storm</h4>Static Storm is an extremely powerful area disable that, if it catches more than one important enemy caster, can turn the battlefield in your favor if they are prevented from escaping its clutches.<br/>Static Storm is best combined with Kinetic Field, as the combination creates a null area where enemies are silenced and cannot escape, making them easy prey for your teammates.<br/>Due to its relatively short cooldown for an ultimate ability, Static Storm can be used tactically for single kills when combined with Glimpse and Kinetic Field. Early game engagements usually do not happen with high frequency, and the spell's cooldown decreases as it is leveled up.<br/>Like Kinetic Field, Static Storm can be used to split the battlefield by preventing members of the opposing team from participating. Placing the storm over an area that the enemy must traverse through will render them helpless as they try to pass through, and can be further punished with Kinetic Field if they attempt to do so, trapping them within. As well, combining the spell's long cast range and short cast animation allows Disruptor to drop the cloud on already-casting enemies, potentially interrupting any channeling spells in the process.<br/>Keep in mind that, without any additional lockdown, Static Storm is not a very strong disabling spell as enemies can simply walk outside of the storm if they are not otherwise hindered, and Kinetic Field takes time to form. If allies can initiate with large area disables like Reverse Polarity or Vacuum, Static Storm can potentially disable entire teams and render them helpless.<br/>Static Storm becomes an extremely deadly spell when upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, as it gains the ability to mute enemies caught within. While it is still blocked by spell immunity, if used on the right targets at the right time, it can prevent Black King Bar from being activated, rendering its targets completely impotent.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Enchantress is a very flexible Intelligence hero that can be a effective jungle hero with focus in ganking and pushing in early stages of the game. Her Enchant allows her to control neutral creeps, allowing her to use their abilities and gain benefits from their auras. She can heal herself and her allies with Nature's Attendants along with dealing true damage with her auto attacks through Impetus.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals pure damage.<br/>Fast movement speed.<br/>Fairly resistant to melee enemies.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very susceptible to burst damage.<br/>Extremely low health points.<br/>Easily countered by Black King Bar.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Enchantress is effective in all stages of the game.<br/> Building  is a very good choice on Enchantress; as aside from the intelligence it gives her it can be used to put some distance between her and her enemy (thus empowering Impetus); or even if very well-timed to use it on Impetus' target while Impetus itself is mid-air; thus hugely increasing its damage. Note however that this will make escaping easier for the enemy if your very powerful Impetus does not kill them.
<br/>Also a teamwork and combo with an allied Pudge's Meat Hook can also maximize your Impetus to its full damage when also combined with Force Staff.<br/>Enchant allows the Enchantress to micromanage just like Chen. Micromanaging is a crucial ability to master for heroes like Enchantress and Chen.<br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Enchantress has a higher attack range than towers, allowing her to attack them without them being able to attack back.<br/>Power Treads and Urn of Shadows are highly recommended for Enchantress.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Untouchable</h4>Untouchable makes Enchantress nearly immune to basic attacks, but be careful, she still has a low health pool and can be easily focused down by spells.<br/>A few levels invested into Untouchable will slow Roshan's attacks to a crawl, making Enchantress an ideal tank against Roshan.<h4>Enchant</h4>With an Octarine Core, Enchantress can have up to 8 units enchanted with Enchant at a time.<br/>Try to get Alpha Wolf in late game as its damage aura scales with your allies' attack damage.<h4>Nature's Attendants</h4>A Soul Ring can be useful for Enchantress; its active ability provides most or all of the mana needed for Nature's Attendants, allowing her to heal effectively 250/450/650/850 health for effectively 0/0/5/20 mana. The ring can later be built into a Bloodstone.<br/>Her heal is very powerful in surviving ganks, as it can be used before getting stunned and if she's the only target, only heavy nukers are capable of killing her.<h4>Impetus</h4>Buying Mana Regeneration Items like Orchid Malevolence, Scythe of Vyse, and Bloodstone are helpful for Enchantress since Impetus burns a lot of mana, even if you have a lot of mana regeneration.<br/> The attack range increases of  fully stack with that of her  upgrade, increasing her attack range to a total of 870. Looking at how Impetus deals damage, this is a significant boost to her damage output. The item also gives strength and attack speed, both of which are needed attributes for Enchantress.
<br/>Impetus deals 82.5/110/137.5 damage per attack, considering attacking a stationary target at max attack range. Dragon Lance increases that to 102/136/170, Aghanim's Scepter to 111/148/185, and both together to 130.5/174/217.5 damage.<br/>Remember that Impetus scales very well into late game, especially with attack speed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Enigma is a tactical spellcaster who is known for his incredibly powerful ultimate, Black Hole. Playing him well requires efficient farming, control of Demonic Conversion and good positioning to get the most mileage out of his gravitational abilities. A well-played Enigma can singlehandedly win a teamfight and possibly determine the outcome of a match by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the most efficient junglers in the game.<br/>Strong pushing and team fight capabilities.<br/>Possesses early game ganking potential with Malefice and Eidolon damage.<br/>Black Hole is one of the strongest team fight spells in the game.<br/>Has two large area-of-effect spells that bypasses spell immunity and deals Pure damage.<br/>Entry level hero for players who want to hone their micromanagement skills.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Rather lengthy cooldowns for all of his spells<br/>Very long cooldown on his ultimate, Black Hole.<br/>Black Hole is a channeled ability with short range, thus making him vulnerable to long range disables, silences, or other hazards.<br/>Not naturally tanky.<br/>Most certainly will be in the jungle nearly every game, making him prone to ganks.<br/>Poor management of his Eidolons can give his opponents an edge in their farming.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Enigma works best with allied heroes that have strong AoE capabilities, such as Warlock, Magnus or Queen of Pain.<br/>Enigma can kill Roshan before the 10-minute mark, with the help of Level 3 or 4 Eidolons. For acquiring them, use Demonic Conversion on either a neutral creep if he's on the Radiant side, or a lane creep if he's on the Dire side. An item commonly picked up is a Medallion of Courage, as it allows him to reduce Roshan's armor for a higher damage output. Begin the fight by tanking Roshan yourself, until your Eidolons have multiplied; let the Eidolons take over and apply a Healing Salve. Try to micro the Eidolons to distribute the damage that Roshan does to them. Re-cast Demonic Conversion on one of the Eidolons before they expire and repeat the process (tank, heal up, nuke). If executed properly, Roshan will fall within about one minute.<br/>Enigma's large mana consumption means that Arcane Boots can be an effective boots upgrade. If the player chooses to ignore upgrading boots, Boots of Travel may be taken later on to take advantage of his pushing power.<br/>Necronomicon is a powerful tool when used with Black Hole.<br/>Shadow Blade is a viable alternative to Blink Dagger, if enemies do not have detection.<br/>Force Staff is a great substitute for Blink Dagger, offering some Intelligence.<br/>Rod of Atos also works on Enigma as it helps with both his mana and health.<br/>Blade Mail discourages Heroes outside of your Black Hole from attacking you. Ghost Scepter can be used to a similar effect.<br/>Urn of Shadows may also prove to be a useful item on a team with hardcore gankers as the mana regeneration and strength boost really helps him out early in the game.<br/>Enigma can get Mekansm and Pipe of Insight quickly thanks to his jungling ability.<br/>Linken's Sphere, as an alternative to Black King Bar, is a good item when up against Heroes with single-target disables that go through spell immunity such as Vengeful Spirit.<br/>One of the deadliest combos executed with Black Hole is Sand king's Epicenter. Locking all heroes in allows Sand King to channel it safely, while also making sure the pulses hit 95% of the time, dealing extraordinary damage. Even more so if used in conjunction with Veil of Discord.<br/>Due to it pulling enemies closer together, Enigma synergizes particularly well with heroes with strong but small AoE damage, be it physical (i.e. Sven with his cleave), or otherwise (i.e. Leshrac with Pulse Nova).<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Malefice</h4>Enigma's presence in encounters is greatly diminished while Black Hole is on cooldown, but he can make himself useful by saving Malefice for a crucial moment and also sneaking around to use Midnight Pulse within an area the enemies may try to escape through. A good combo is to use Malefice on an enemy walking through Midnight Pulse or any allied AoE damaging spell.<br/> Malefice can prove to be surprisingly detrimental to opponents with slow attack speed, such as siege units and 's Golem, as the periodic stun will reset their attack animation and prevent their attacks from connecting with their intended targets.
<br/>Roshan in particular is hampered by this spell greatly, as this not only prevents him from performing basic attacks, but also greatly reduce the chances of him bashing.<br/> Take note that Malefice acts as a debuff that can be dispelled easily with any basic dispel.
<br/>Although Malefice can easily be dispelled, the first stun will always occur so long as the spell hits the target. The subsequent stuns/damage instances may not be important if the primary purpose of the spell is to disrupt channeling abilities.<h4>Demonic Conversion</h4>At a 170 mana per cast, Demonic Conversion is a very costly spell during the early game. It is generally a good idea to withhold casting it during the laning phase until the skill is at level 3 or 4 when the eidolons deal better damage.<br/> Eidolons have an innate 50% spell resistance, but have very low maximum health, even when the skill is fully maxed. With their high gold bounty, they are prime targets for farmers, and care should be taken to ensure that they are not recklessly sacrificed.
<br/> While they have rather low health, they deal very high damage, especially when you've manage to amass six of them after splitting. Coupled with items such as  and 's summons, and they are a force to be reckoned with.
<br/>In sufficient number, Eidolons can be used effectively in encounters, as en masse their collective attack does significant damage. If you die in an encounter and you have Eidolons still alive, use them to boost your team's damage a little.<br/>Demonic Conversion is one of the few abilities that can instantly destroy siege units. Keep this in mind whenever your tower is under attack by them.<br/>Keeping Eidolons around you is a very good idea when there is a Pudge or Mirana on the enemy team, as it makes you very difficult to be hooked or arrowed, which is important considering that Enigma is very easy prey for kills in the early game.<br/> When jungling, max Demonic Conversion to beef up your Eidolons and increase their damage. Also, micro your Eidolons to make sure none of the initial three Eidolons die to jungle creeps so that all of them can multiply. This increases jungling speed significantly. Do not be afraid to tank for your Eidolons either when clearing the big camps.
<br/>Eidolons will always split and fully heal upon firing their 7th shot. Careful micro-management is key whenever you are using them for jungling or tower-pushing.<h4>Midnight Pulse</h4>Investing one point in Midnight Pulse for early game utility is usually enough, as Enigma does not have a rather large mana pool early game, and that mana could be better spent on creating Eidolons for his time in the jungle or to have some sort of immediate stun for his enemies using Malefice.<br/>Using Midnight Pulse before Black Hole is often a good idea to boost the damage done. However, you must use this at your discretion because there might not be a time to use it or it can make you miss out on crucial Black Holes.<br/>Like Black Hole, Midnight Pulse deals pure damage and bypasses spell immunity. This means heroes who use Black King Bar will still take the full effect of the spell if they do not leave the area of effect. When not comboing with Black Hole, Midnight Pulse can be used to hold off important chokepoints such as tier 3 towers or Roshan from opposing heroes.<h4>Black Hole</h4>Black Hole is a very powerful disable that bypasses the spell-immunity granted by Black King Bar. Lasting for 4 seconds, a successful cast will almost guarantee a team-wipe, especially if he's paired up with a Hero like Jakiro or Sven.<br/>Black Hole is a channeling spell, and care and consideration should be kept in mind when looking at the opponent's Hero lineup. You may need to invest in a Black King Bar or Linken's Sphere to minimise the odds of getting interrupted.<br/> Beware of  as he can counter you very well. While you are channeling Black Hole, you are also very prone to having it stolen or interrupted. While spell immunity prevents most interruption, Rubick's Spell Steal is unaffected by it, and he can potentially ruin your initiation with the Black Hole of his own.  could be bought to prevent Spell Steal, however, keep in mind that Rubick has two other single-target abilities, and possibly a couple of single-target items as well.
<br/>Shadow Blade may also be bought to avoid all of Rubick's spells if used during Black Hole's channeling. But keep in mind that invisibility is very easily countered by detection items, and if you lack a Black King Bar, his Telekinesis' stun could be used to interrupt you instead.<br/>It is always a good idea to refresh your Black Hole immediately after casting, as a teamfight can happen anytime, anywhere. Although, depending on the situation, it is also equally wise to save Refresher Orb for next cast, as a double Black Hole can be very devastating to the enemy team, provided it is executed properly.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Invoker is one of the most difficult to learn heroes in the game, but also one of the most flexible and powerful casters. As such, his skill floor is not impossibly high, however, his skill ceiling is almost unparalleled, and thus he takes significant amounts of practice in order to learn. Because of his need for quick levels and gold, he is usually played as a mid hero. Due to Invoker's heavy level requirement in order to be effective, it is generally advised to focus on leveling two orbs and getting a value point in the third, rather than trying to level all three equally. While Invoker can be more flexible if he can cast strong spells in all categories, the lack of specialization also limits his potency in areas where his team might need him to be strong. Invoker can only truly reach his full strength at level 25, and as such he needs to be able to effectively contribute to teamfights before reaching that point.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely versatile.<br/>Numerous disables.<br/>Deadly magic combos.<br/>Can push quite well.<br/>Good solo killing ability with Quas-Exort.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Steep learning curve.<br/>Requires significant early farm to be effective.<br/>Not very good at farming compared to other cores.<br/>Vulnerable to silence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Quas Exort Invoker needs lots of farm. Getting an early Boots of Travel to get faster around the map and kill creeps is always a good thing. Usually followed by Drums of Endurance, Blink Dagger or Force Staff and Aghanims Scepter.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Quas</h4>Active Quas orbs gives health regeneration, which is especially useful for staying in lane.<br/>Often the last orb to be maxed as it doesn't provide much for Invoker other than health regen.<h4>Wex</h4>Active Wex orbs increase Invoker's attack speed, and more importantly movement speed which can be useful for chasing down enemies.<h4>Exort</h4>Active Exort orbs gives damage, therefore players often level up Exort first to make last-hitting easier in lane.<h4>Invoke</h4>Invoke is a powerful spell which allows Invoker to forge spells in a short duration of 6 second and at higher levels, possessing Aghanim's Scepter gives the advantage of invoking spells in a time span of 2 seconds.<br/>Whenever a new spell is Invoked, the oldest of his two currently Invoked spells is removed from selection. Beware of which spell combinations you wish to execute, and queue them through Invoke accordingly.<br/>The above can be facilitated more easily by switching the spell orders as needed. If the oldest currently Invoked spell is Invoked, it will swap positions with the newest one without putting Invoke on cooldown, allowing Invoker to immediately queue another spell for Invoke. This can be crucial for quickly ordering spell combinations if a required spell for that combo is already the oldest Invoked spell.<br/>Careful not invoke a spell that's still on cooldown, as this will waste Invoke's cooldown. Since the ability icon disappears after being replaced, players will have to rely on instinct and experience to know whether or not a spell is on cooldown.<br/>If you want to cast three spells in quick succession, it can help to have the orbs for the third spell prepared before casting the other two. This allows you to cast your first two spells and then Invoke the third immediately once the oldest Invoked spell is on cooldown. This can let you cast nuke-heavy combos such as Sun Strike + Chaos Meteor + Deafening Blast, as the first two spells have delays that allow you to queue up the third so that you can land all three on a target simultaneously.<br/>With an Aghanim's Scepter, it is possible to Invoke spells every two seconds. If your reflexes are good enough, you can barrage the enemy with spells as quickly as you can queue them up. However, this is only truly useful in the late-game once all of your orbs have been leveled up enough for their associated spells to be truly potent.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Jakiro is a tanky intelligence hero with low cooldown damage over time spells and high amounts of magic damage. He offers a large amount of teamfight with Ice Path and Macropyre ,and push with Dual Breath and Liquid Fire<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky lane support.<br/>Fast and efficient lane pusher/tower sieger.<br/>Low cooldown disables.<br/>Large AoE control.<br/>Not item-dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily avoidable spells with longer cast times.<br/>Fairly slow.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Jakiro has a slower turn rate than most other Heroes. Coupled with his long cast and attack animations, it makes it difficult for him to land his spells effectively when his enemies are behind him, as nimble opponents are able to see Jakiro's actions being telegraphed to them and can take the appropriate measures to either sidestep or counter them.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Dual Breath</h4>Dual Breath has an enormously long second cast backswing, so it is often worthwhile to cancel it by hitting "stop" key after Dual Breath reaches its cast point. This will allow Jakiro to cast another spell, attack, or move in rapid succession after casting Dual Breath.<br/>Dual Breath deals a greater than average damage compared to other similar area of effect spells (barring ultimates), making it a very good skill for pushing lanes. Take note that the damage is dealt overtime and can be countered by high health regeneration and can be dispelled.<br/>Dual Breath's casting mechanics is such that it applies a slow debuff first before the damage overtime debuff. Coupled with its long casting animation, quick-fingered opponents may be able to evade the damage overtime debuff.<h4>Ice Path</h4> Ice Path will stun any enemy unit that comes in contact with it for the duration it has remaining on the battlefield. meaning that in many cases, most opponents won't be stunned for the full duration of Ice Path if it doesn't land directly on them.
<br/>Ice Path makes for a good area denial spell, as it covers a large area, similar to Invoker's Ice Wall and Underlord's Pit of Malice.<br/>Predicting where an enemy will go and casting Ice Path at that area right before the enemy gets there, causing the enemy walk into Ice Path, is just as effective as casting the Ice Path directly on an enemy.<br/>Ice Path has a fixed damage of 50, meaning that, by itself, it isn't a good source of damage. Be sure you have other spells ready to be cast right after Ice Path, or that you have other teammates to support you to maximise the effectiveness of Ice Path's utility.<br/>Ice Path grants vision to the area that it is cast at, making it a good spell to check the Roshan pit.<h4>Liquid Fire</h4> Liquid Fire is a great way to harass opponents during the laning stage. If nothing else, the attack speed reduction should mess with the enemy laner's ability to last hit effectively.
<br/>At level 4, Liquid Fire can be applied to the same opponent continuously, as the debuff lasts for 5 seconds and spell has a cooldown of 4 seconds. It can be used to effectively keep harassers in check by hampering their attack speed almost indefinitely.<br/>Liquid Fire is incredibly effective against enemies with a low natural attack speed, such as Roshan and siege creeps, as it will reduce their already slow attack rate to a crawl.<br/>Liquid Fire fully affects buildings and will cause towers to suffer a reduction in their attack speed, making it a great tool for pushing.<br/> Liquid Fire has a greater attack range when cast manually. Use that to your advantage when you're against Heroes with a naturally greater attack range than you, or when your opponent is just out of reach of your own natural attack range.
<br/>The manual cast range increase stacks with his talent and with Dragon Lance and Hurricane Pike.<br/>Liquid Fire is the only skill in Jakiro's arsenal that can bypass spell immunity. This makes it an effective spell to counter natural users of Black King Bar, such as Phantom Assassin and Sven as the attack speed reduction fully affects them.<h4>Macropyre</h4>Like Dual Breath, Macropyre has a long cast backswing animation. Hitting the "stop" key during Macropyre's backswing animation after the cast point is reached will allow Jakiro to queue up other actions. As in the case of Dual Breath, mastering this can slightly increase Jakiro's DPS or effectiveness.<br/> Macropyre has lasts for a long duration and has a relatively short cooldown, making a very good spell for area-denial.
<br/>With Aghanim's Scepter's upgrade, Macropyre lasts for 30 seconds. When cast at the right intervals, it can effectively clear 2 waves of creeps and give your team a huge advantage in terms of pushing.<br/>Macropyre's huge coverage means that it can clear vast areas of forest very easily. Bear this in mind if you have allies or enemies that utilise trees for their abilities.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Keeper of the Light is an adept support who is capable of aiding his allies and hindering his enemies with his array of spells. He can be a strong babysitter whose presence greatly augments the power of a lane, and transition into a pusher and counter-pusher past the laning stage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not Item dependent<br/>Can give mana to team and to himself<br/>High movement speed even without boots<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can die easily<br/>Countered by heroes who don't need mana<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While he has very strong counter-pushing and support spells, Ezalor is also extremely fragile, with a mere 14 base strength, the lowest in the game (tied with Medusa). As such, positioning is very important, as he needs to be close enough to cast his powerful spells yet also far enough away to be able to avoid being jumped on by the enemy.<br/>Keeper of the Light is highly adept at pushing, as he can replenish teammates' and his own mana with Chakra Magic, allowing profligate use of spells, and Illuminate can severely damage if not outright kill entire creep waves. Along with his ability to re-position allies globally with Recall, Ezalor can be a force to be reckoned with at all points in the game.<br/>Keeper of the Light is a very strong side-laner, able to use his spells to harass the enemy at range and support his team's spell-casting. He is in his element in the safe lane, although he can also be played in a dual off-lane to harass and threaten the enemy's safe-lane carry.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Illuminate</h4>Illuminate is a very strong channeled nuke that allows Keeper of the Light to output a large amount of damage on a very low cooldown.<br/>Illuminate's strong creep-killing power makes Keeper of the Light a remarkably good farmer and counter-pusher considering his supportive role, as he can use it to either knock down large creep waves approaching a friendly tower or blast up to two neutral camps at once. As such, it is a very strong skill once maxed out, since its nuking power can allow him to farm up support items as needed.<br/>However, remember that Illuminate will only deal more damage if it has been channeled for a longer duration, which is not always possible if the enemy is moving around in an attempt to avoid being an easy target. As such, it is not always wise to max out Illuminate as early as possible, since a level 2 Illuminate channeled for less than two seconds does the same amount of damage as a level 1 Illuminate channeled for the same duration, but costs more mana and requires a skill point.<br/>If using Illuminate to harass or nuke an enemy player, try to cast it from the enemy's fog of war, such as behind the treeline, to give them as little warning as possible. As well, leading disables by teammates can immobilize an enemy long enough to channel the full duration of Illuminate during a gank.<br/>Although Illuminate is extremely powerful for early-game pushing and harassment, it will disrupt the farm of Ezalor's lane partner if it is targeted on the entire creep wave, as it can potentially kill creeps and will push the wave closer to the enemy's tower where it is more dangerous to last-hit. If used, it should be aimed only to damage enemy heroes by targeting the wave either at an oblique angle or behind the creep wave.<br/>Illuminate reveals fog of war around Ezalor while channeling, making it a useful spell for gaining vision. Remember that charging it to fulmination increases its sight range; releasing it immediately will not be good for gaining sight.<h4>Mana Leak</h4>Mana Leak is an unorthodox disable that destroys the enemy's mana as they attempt to move.<br/>One point in Mana Leak can be powerful in the stage, although it has a high mana cost. When setting up a kill, it is best combined with Illuminate, as Keeper of the Light can cast Mana Leak on an enemy hero, then threaten them with Illuminate damage if they do not move out of the way. However, it should not be spammed as, and only be used early on when to ganking or setting up kills.<br/>Reducing the enemy's mana in-lane can make the lane safer for Keeper of the Light and his partner by preventing the enemy from going aggressive or harassing with their spells, and can set up kills as well by reducing their ability to cast escape spells and potentially stun them once they've lost all their mana. Successfully destroying enough of the enemy's mana pool can force them to leave the lane, as staying will threaten them with a stun every time Mana Leak comes off cooldown.<br/>Remember that leveling up Mana Leak also improves its casting range, as well as the leak and stun duration. Taking early points can give Ezalor more teamfight and chasing potential as it can be cast on enemies from farther away, allowing it to be used from safety behind teammates or for catching fleeing enemies.<br/>Because Mana Leak destroys mana as an expression of the target's maximum mana, it is disproportionately effective against heroes with large mana pools. As well, it can greatly hinder melee carries that have to move much closer to their targets to attack, resulting in increased distance moved and thus more mana destroyed.<br/>While Mana Leak can severely hinder an enemy's attempts to cast spells, it does not proc if the target blinks over short distances and does not affect spell immune or invulnerable enemies. Be sure to choose your targets wisely, as certain heroes can simply ignore its effects.<br/>Try to cast Mana Leak as early as possible in teamfights, as the enemy may be forced to move closer in order to engage your teammates, and thus lose a sizable portion of their mana earlier. Under the right circumstances, it may be possible to destroy enough of an enemy's mana that they will run out in the middle of the fight and be unable to cast successive spells.<br/>One useful utility for Mana Leak is to halt pursuing enemies. If an enemy is trying to pursue Keeper of the Light or one of his allies, Mana Leak will cause them to lose mana as they continue to pursue, which can be enough to force them to break off. If the enemy chooses to continue, they may find themselves stunned at an inopportune time, unable to cast spells, and threatened with long-duration stuns from successive casts of Mana Leak.<h4>Chakra Magic</h4>Chakra Magic allows Keeper of the Light to replenish a significant amount of mana for himself and his allies, ensuring that spells can always be cast.<br/>Chakra Magic is extremely useful in lane as it can allow teammates with small mana pools or low cooldown spells to cast their abilities much more frequently. Heroes with strong disables but small mana pools like Wraith King, Earthshaker, Sven and Vengeful Spirit can use their stuns much more frequently to set up kills in the knowledge that Ezalor can replenish their mana afterward, while those with powerful harass spells like Bristleback, Phantom Lancer and Undying can put continuous pressure on their lane opponents that would otherwise be impossible without a source of mana replenishment.<br/>Due to its scaling, it is best to put at least two points into Chakra Magic in the laning stage, as its efficiency increases more than twofold. On top of providing more mana replenishment for allies, it also greatly increases Keeper of the Light's mana efficiently, allowing him to utilize his other spells more often.<br/>Besides replenishing mana, Chakra Magic can reduce the cooldown of the next ability that the target uses in the next 15 seconds. This makes it a powerful ability to cast on teammates with low-cooldown disables and initiation spells, since it can allow them to use two stuns or nukes in quick succession, increasing the amount of crowd control available from a single spell. As well, it affects passive abilities with cooldowns, so abilities like Jinada, Geminate Attack and Greater Bash also benefit from the reduced cooldown.<br/>Chakra Magic will also increase the maximum size of the target's mana pool for the duration of the buff, which can allow heroes with small mana pools but expensive spell combos to cast all of their spells instantaneously. For instance, a Venomancer without Arcane Boots will often have trouble casting his full round of spells due to the high cost of his ultimate, but casting Chakra Magic can allow him to cast his ultimate as well as Venomous Gale and any item abilities.<h4>Spirit Form</h4>Spirit Form gives Keeper of the Light access to several very powerful abilities. Besides Recall and Blinding Light, Illuminate may be cast remotely without standing still to channel it, making it a very powerful ability.<br/>One of the most powerful uses for Spirit Form is to unlock remote channeling of Illuminate, allowing Keeper of the Light to set the spell in place and then move on to execute other actions while it builds up. A Spirit Form-boosted Illuminate allows Ezalor to take advantage of a fully-channeled Illuminate without the drawback of having to sit still to charge it up.<br/>When being chased, don't be afraid to use Spirit Form to aid in your escape. While Mana Leak can discourage enemies from chasing you, you can also cast Blinding Light to knock back and blind chasing enemies, or cast Illuminate in the direction you are headed, either forcing the enemy to walk in front of the channeling spirit and take damage, or break off and allow you to escape.<br/>Purchasing an Aghanim's Scepter greatly increases the power of Spirit Form, as Ezalor will always have access to its abilities, on top of gaining unobstructed vision and being able to heal allies with Illuminate during the daytime. Using Illuminate will allow Keeper of the Light to continuously heal allied creep waves and heroes, significantly boosting his pushing and sustain power, while the unobstructed vision gives his team a strong vision advantage, especially once combined with a Gem of True Sight.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Leshrac is renowned as one of the strongest nukers in the game, who is capable of putting out tremendous amounts of area magical damage in order to destroy his foes. These nukes are strong at killing both heroes and creeps, making Leshrac a powerful foe both in teamfights and while pushing.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great wave clearing<br/>Good tower pushing with Diabolic Edict<br/>Large amounts of AOE magic damage<br/>Good movement speed<br/>Very low cooldown spells<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Bad strength and mediocre armor...<br/>...but still needs to be in the thick of the fight to deal damage<br/>Poor cast animations<br/>Most of his damage output is completely negated by magic immunity<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One of Leshrac's greatest weaknesses is his long cast animations. In order to counteract this, good positioning and prediction are key, as Leshrac must stand still for an extended period of time before the spell takes its effect.<br/>While Leshrac has tremendous nuking power, much of it is damage over time, requiring him to survive long enough to cast multiple iterations. As such, not only is a large mana pool required in order to sustain such casting, but also enough HP to avoid dying to the enemy while casting.<br/>Mind that because the vast majority of Leshrac's damage output is magical damage, he can be easily countered by spell immunity, and his frailty allows enemies to use his damage against him via Blade Mail. If Leshrac is to be effective in teamfights, he must focus on disabling enemies to prevent them from activating spell immunity, and build spell immunity himself both to increase his survivability and block Blade Mail damage.<br/> Leshrac can usually be played as a core or a support.
<br/>Played as a support, Leshrac has powerful disables that can greatly aid his team in fights, and can deal tremendous damage to enemy towers as well. His nuking spells also allow him to obtain gold fairly reliably for buying more support items. A support Leshrac should focus on purchasing utility items to aid his team in fights.<br/>Played as a core, Leshrac has tremendous pushing and nuking power that can allow him to deal large amounts of damage in teamfights, or push lanes and take towers by himself. Once he has enough mana, he can use his nuking spells to farm very effectively as well. Core Leshrac should aim to build items that enhance his survivability and casting, as he must stay alive in order to put out the damage to kill enemies, and requires steady mana regeneration in order to fuel his costly and low-cooldown spells.<br/>All of Leshrac's spells have differing priorities to max out depending on his farm priority, team lineup and expected opposition. There is no one-size-fits-all build, as certain abilities may greatly synergize with those of allies, cover for their weaknesses, or exploit a flaw in the enemy's lineup.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Split Earth</h4>Split Earth is a ground-targeted spell that stuns enemies within its radius while dealing damage.<br/>Split Earth will stun any targets it hits for 2 seconds, no matter how many levels were put into the spell. Therefore, it should be leveled up if you need the wider radius to make hitting the spell easier, or the increased damage.<br/>Remember that the stun's effect occurs 0.35 seconds after the cast animation, so it will stun and damage roughly one second after Leshrac is commanded to cast the spell. If an enemy is watching your cast animations to predict when the stun will land, they can dodge its effects with certain spells (such as Phase Shift or Blade Fury). Therefore, if landing the stun without a leading disable, it can be useful to cancel the animation mid-way to fake out tricky opponents.<br/>When using Split Earth as a support, it is best to only put one point into it early on and have a teammate lead with a reliable targeted stun first. If an enemy has been immobilized by a stun, they cannot move to avoid Split Earth and the long cast animation and small effect radius do not matter. This way, you can chain-stun an opponent and spend your skill points on your other nuking spells.<br/>It's a good spell against Roshan as it won't trigger it's Spell block and you don't need to wonder if it's off cd.<h4>Diabolic Edict</h4>Diabolic Edict causes physical damage explosions to surround Leshrac once cast, targeting any enemies near Leshrac and following him as he moves.<br/>Edict deals tremendous amounts of damage if all the explosions land on a single target. It is best used after other enemy targets in the area, especially creeps, have been cleared away by your other spells, in order to make the most of its effects.<br/>Diabolic Edict is what allows Leshrac to destroy towers so quickly by himself if he is left alone by the enemy team. A single cast of level 4 Diabolic Edict can deal 940 damage to a tier 1 tower, after reductions, which alone is enough to bring it below 30% HP (not including any creeps and siege units also attacking the tower). If pushing down the enemy's towers early on is a priority, consider maxing out Edict first.<br/>Try to keep Diabolic Edict in reserve when attacking a tower, as the enemy may immediately use their Glyph of Fortification when they see you cast Edict. Try to force the enemy to fortify their towers, and then cast Edict afterward to deal the most damage possible.<br/>The explosions follow Leshrac, and are focused on a radius around him, so even if there are enemy creeps near a tower it is possible to re-position Leshrac so that the tower is within the spell's radius but the enemy creeps are not. This also allows Leshrac to chase enemy heroes with the spell after casting it, as they will automatically hit any enemies that he is walking next to.<br/>Keep in mind that the explosions will still home in on invisible units if they are within the radius of the spell, and as such can be used as a weak form of detection. This means that Edict can be used as a counter against abilities such as Cloak and Dagger, Shadow Walk, Meld, and so on.<h4>Lightning Storm</h4>Lightning Storm is a low-cooldown unit-targeted spell that damages and slows its target, then jumps to other nearby enemies. As such, it's a great spell to trigger a Linken's Sphere, although only the first bolt pops it.<br/>Lightning Storm is a strong farming and wave-clearing spell, as its low cooldown and area targeted nature allows Leshrac to deal large amounts of magical damage in a short amount of time.<br/>Lightning Storm is the perfect complement to Diabolic Edict, as the spell's nuking power and low cooldown can make short work of lane creeps, allowing Diabolic Edict to be focused on the enemy's tower alone. As well, it can be used as a leading slow on an enemy prior to casting Split Earth.<br/>Try to take advantage of Lightning Storm's long cast range and ability to bounce. It can be a powerful harassing spell as Leshrac can hit a creep with the spell and allow it to bounce to the enemy hero.<h4>Pulse Nova</h4>Pulse Nova deals tremendous amounts of damage to all nearby enemies, and is a toggled spell that does not require a cast animation. It is a powerful spell to use when chasing or fleeing, especially alongside Diabolic Edict, as it can remain active while moving, allowing Leshrac to run down foes or discourage them from chasing him.<br/>Keep in mind, Pulse Nova requires Leshrac to stand very close to the targets he wishes to damage. If you intend on using Pulse Nova in team fights, survivability items that boost Leshrac's HP are highly recommended.<br/>Note that since Pulse Nova can be toggled, it can also be used as a farming spell by turning it on while farming creep waves or jungle camps, adding to your nuking power.<br/>Since the first damage instance is dealt immediately upon toggling the spell on, the damage per second of Pulse Nova can be increased by constantly toggling it off then on after every two damage instances. However, the cost of this tactic is a significantly higher mana cost due to incurring the toggle cost multiple times, so ensure that Leshrac's mana pool is sufficient to support it.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lich is a ranged intelligence hero that is primarily used to win the laning stage of the game with Sacrifice. Sacrifice denies the opponent experience points and gives them to you and your allies. Once past the laning stage, Lich is still a threat with Chain Frost. Lich does not have any strong escape mechanism and is rather frail, so proper positioning is a must.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Almost always able to dominates the laning stage and thus securing the early advantage for your team<br/>Simple to play, great for beginners<br/>A good nuker with spammable Frost Blast<br/>Able to destroy the enemy team if they are poorly positioned and huddled close with Chain Frost.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no escape capabilities and is quite frail<br/>Is not as strong past the laning/early stage of the game<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lich focuses on mana to support his allies, so investing on Intelligence is important for usage of abilities, extra damage, and mana.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Frost Blast</h4>Frost Blast is a slowing damaging spell used for harassing and dealing with creeps, and is more effective when used on a hero close to a group of creeps. This is Lich's only AOE damage-dealing spell, so paired with Sacrifice it can be a good farming spell.<br/>Frost Blast only deals damage at a small area, so Sacrifice is really good for using it repeatedly.<br/>Frost Blast doesn't deal much damage, so use it for creeps or for chasing enemies.<br/>When casting Frost Blast on enemy heroes in lane to harass them, try to follow up with a few attacks on them while they're slowed.<h4>Sacrifice</h4>In the early game, Sacrifice is primarily used to control the lane equilibrium and deny the opponent vital early experience points. Constantly casting Sacrifice will tend to have your creeps closer to your tower thus Lich or whoever he is support will have a safer place to farm. It also allows Lich and his allies to grossly out-level whoever Lich is laning against and thus able to net kills or force the opponent out of his lane with stronger spells. In the later stages, it will be mainly used for obtaining mana.<br/>Use Sacrifice for fueling Chain Frost, as it gives good mana.<br/>Typically you would want to use Sacrifice on a high health creep, because the obtained mana is based on HP or hitpoints. But in the laning stage, focus on casting it on the ranged creep as it provides the most gold and experience for the enemy.<br/>Dropping items that increases your mana pool like Arcane Boots or Aghanim's Scepter before casting Sacrifice will net you more mana. Be careful when doing it in front of your enemies as they can deny your item. This is especially important if Sacrifice is not maxed out.<h4>Ice Armor</h4>A good support spell, Ice Armor can protect buildings and heroes, giving them resistance to attacks.When the Glyph of Fortification isn't available, Ice Armor can give some bulk to towers and buildings.<br/>Ice Armor can be used on squishy heroes too for some defense, or, even better, to provide additional resistance for bulky heroes.<br/>Putting Ice Armor on autocast or continuously applying it on teammates can often give your team an immense armor boost.<br/>If the laning stage is going fine, and the enemy solo offlaner is getting crushed, putting an early level in Ice Armor and casting it on jungling teammates can give them much better sustain in the jungle.<h4>Chain Frost</h4>Chain Frost is a massive damage-dealing, slowing, multi-target nuke. It is very fatal when bouncing between enemy heroes, doing massive damage and slowing them.Chain Frost is most effective when used on a group of enemy heroes with Aghanim's Scepter on Lich because this removes the limit of bounces, making it a very dangerous orb of frozen death, enabling him to do a one-on-five fight.<br/>Abilities that trap or disable multiple enemies sync well with Chain Frost, because this allows Lich to not worry about enemies separating far enough to surpass the bounce range.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lina is a powerful ranged intelligence hero that can be played as a support or a semi-carry. Her abilities allow her to nuke and stun multiple heroes at once and her strong ultimate can annihilate low health heroes. Her passive allows her right-clicks to far exceed that of other typical intelligence heroes, giving her a very respectable amount of physical damage output. Played well, Lina is an extremely strong ganking hero who can kill out of position heroes all by herself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong AoE nukes.<br/>Very powerful single target nuke.<br/>Long attack range.<br/>Deals fairly high physical damage with passive.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow cast animations.<br/>Slow attack animation.<br/>No mobility.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lina has one of the longest attack ranges in the game, but also the slowest attack animation. Time your attacks well to get last hits.<br/>Always cancel the backswing animation after casting your spells, as Lina suffers from long animation times.<br/>In teamfights it can be very beneficial to quickly focus on low-HP or support heroes, as Lina has very good nuking abilities.<br/>If Lina has the basic items she needs, it is wise to augment her physical attack for the sake of Fiery Soul. Almost uniquely among Intelligence supports, Lina's autoattacks becomes a serious threat if she attains a level advantage (owing to her enormous intelligence growth and her passive ability).<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Dragon Slave</h4>Use Dragon Slave to harass and get last hits in lane.<br/>Dragon Slave's range is deceptively long, and can be used to finish off fleeing opponents, or as a parting shot when retreating.<br/>Max Dragon Slave first if your intent is to deal the most damage possible.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Light Strike Array</h4>Light Strike Array is often leveled first because the stun can either save Lina or help her finish a gank.<br/>Combining Light Strike Array with a guaranteed stun such as Magic Missile or Storm Hammer makes Lina a serious ganking force early on.<br/>Light Strike Array has a very long cast animation. Make sure to target near Lina, so she doesn't need to move into range before casting it.<br/>Positioning items such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity, Blink Dagger or Force Staff can help land Light Strike Array and thus Lina's whole spell combo without relying on other heroes.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Fiery Soul</h4>One early point in Fiery Soul can boost Lina's harass potential, especially after landing Light Strike Array on an enemy, as her attack speed will be temporarily increased.<br/>Use all of Lina's other abilities first to take the speed-enhancing effect of Fiery Soul to its maximum potential.<br/>It is sometimes acceptable to use Lina's other abilities simply to gain Fiery Soul's speed bonuses, such as when attacking a tower, or when you're certain no enemies are nearby.<br/>In a prolonged teamfight, remember to continuously use Lina's abilities the moment they come off cooldown, so her attack speed remains high throughout the fight.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Laguna Blade</h4>Upon reaching level six, immediately begin looking for opportunities to use Laguna Blade, as few enemies can withstand its massive damage in the early game. A few kills with Laguna Blade in the early game can put Lina's team comfortably ahead.<br/> In most cases, it is better to deal the burst damage right away in teamfights instead of saving Laguna Blade until the very last moment to finish an enemy.
<br/>Only save Laguna Blade for situations where ending an enemy decisively would prevent them from recovering, such as against targets with high health regeneration.<br/>Do not waste Laguna Blade on a target that is certain to die.<br/>Laguna Blade can hit for 1700 pure damage if she combines Aghanim's Scepter and Refresher Orb, granting her enormous nuking power.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lion is a powerful spellcaster and is mostly played as support or ganker hero due to his disabling spells. He is best to partner with auto attack carries or another spellcaster to finish enemies quickly. His Earth Spike and his Hex make him a formidible disabler, while his Mana Drain can prevent enemy heroes from casting spells if done effectively and allowed to drain. His Finger of Death can easily nuke the chosen enemy, dealing incredible damage to help his allies or himself finish a kill.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the best disabler hero.<br/>Good early/mid game nuker.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily targeted due to low health.<br/>Slow movement.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lion is renowned for being one of the strongest disabling supports in the game. He has two hard disables in Hex and Earth Spike, which allow him to set up kills in virtually any situation once he hits level 2, potentially giving his team a strong early advantage with his combination of nukes and disables. Be sure to layer your disables properly, in order to lock down a target for the longest possible duration instead of stacking the disables and wasting one or both.<br/>Like most other intelligence-based casters, Lion suffers from low strength and agility growth, making him frail and easy to kill if focused down. Due to this and his strong array of disables, Lion benefits greatly from building survivability and mobility items, as his great intelligence growth combined with his Mana Drain ability means that he is never wanting for mana to cast his spells.<br/>Beware that due to his single-target nature, all of Lion's spells can be blocked with Linken's Sphere, or even worse reflected with Lotus Orb. As such, be extremely careful about when and where you cast your spells, and be sure to regularly check the enemy's inventory so that you know if they are building towards either item.<br/> Because of his powerful early disabling potential, Lion can be played in a variety of ways.
<br/>In most cases, Lion is played as a hard support, protecting his safe lane carry by pulling neutral camps and harassing the enemy off-laner. He is also able to set up kills with his disables if he is able to get within range to cast them on the enemy, whether it be their off-laner or rotating to gank their mid-laner.<br/>True to his name, Lion is also a strong roamer who can prowl and pounce on enemies in their lanes, using his disables to hold them in place while his teammates kill them.<br/>In unusual circumstances, Lion can also be a respectable mid, as his good base damage allows him to compete with other mid heroes with last-hits, and his disables allow him to set up the enemy mid if supports rotate for a gank. The early gold and levels can allow him to transition into a strong roaming who can catch enemies with his disables and nuke them down with Finger of Death.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Earth Spike</h4>Earth Spike is a disable that deals damage and stuns in a line in front of Lion, making it a well-rounded stun and nuke.<br/>Because both its damage and stun duration scale with levels, Earth Spike is generally Lion's best ability to max out first. This allows Lion to deal respectable nuke damage and disable for a good duration with a single spell.<br/>Earth Spike is unusual in that it can be both ground-targeted and unit-targeted. This allows the spell to be used both as a reliable and unreliable disable, however, it also means that the spell can be blocked by Linken's Sphere even if ground-targeted.<br/>Due to its line target nature, Earth Spike can potentially damage and stun multiple targets at once. If the opportunity presents itself, try to position yourself such that you can line up a stun on at least two enemies at once.<br/>One unusual aspect of Earth Spike is that it can be targeted at only 500 range but travels up to 825, possibly hitting enemies up to 950 units away. This means that while the spell can reliably stun an enemy at 500 range or less, with skill it can be used as an unreliable stun to disable an enemy at almost twice that distance.<br/>Beware that Earth Spike does have a travel time, and that it is possible for the enemy to dodge the spikes near the end of the spell if they are fast enough. As such, it can pay off to get as close as possible to a target before casting Earth Spike on them, to give them as little time to react if possible.<br/>Keep in mind that the elevated spike animation will still play if the spell catches an invisible hero. While it cannot be used to reliably search for invisible enemies due to its thin radius, a successful hit will alert allies to a stunned invisible enemy, allowing them to cast an area-targeted unreliable disable or nuke on that spot.<h4>Hex</h4>Hex is an extremely powerful hard disable that can silence and mute its target, preventing them from casting spells or using items. As well, it has an instant cast animation, giving the enemy absolutely no time to react.<br/>Due to its poor scaling, Hex is generally best left with one point in the early game. Each additional level only adds half a second to the disable duration while drastically increasing the mana cost, which can tax Lion's mana pool beyond its limit. It is better left as the last ability to max out, as Lion can replenish his mana pool reliably with more levels in Mana Drain, and it is unlikely that targets need to be hard-disabled multiple times in the early game when all-out teamfights are rare.<br/>Due to its instant cast time, Hex is a powerful initiating disable since it can lock down a target immediately when Lion gets within range to cast it. As well, the slow it inflicts on the target makes them an easier target to hit with a followed up Earth Spike. However, this will generally vary according to the situation, as Earth Spike's longer disable range can allow Lion to disable an enemy from a greater distance away first, then follow up with a longer-duration Hex.<br/>Hex can instantly destroy illusions, making it a powerful counter to certain illusion heroes and Manta Style. If the enemy can create a small number of powerful illusions with abilities like Replicate, Phantasm or Mirror Image, Lion can instantly remove one of them from play or hard-disable the source of the illusions directly. And if an enemy uses Manta Style defensively, Hex can instantly remove one of them, increasing the chance of finding the right hero to 50%.<br/>In dire situations, Hex can be cast defensively as well. If a lone enemy initiates on Lion and he is unable to kill them with his nukes, casting a max level Hex on them will disable them for 4 seconds, more than enough time for Lion to channel a Town Portal Scroll to escape.<h4>Mana Drain</h4>Mana Drain is a strong utility and soft-disable spell that allows Lion to roam independently as he can maintain a near-limitless supply of mana.<br/>Next to Earth Spike, Mana Drain can be a powerful spell to max out early on. While it is not very strong at level 1, getting it to level 2 allows Lion to start recouping the mana cost of his spells, giving him the mana to cast his full combo whenever he needs to. At level 4, it can drain mana at double the rate that it does at level 3, making much more powerful.<br/>Used judiciously, Mana Drain can hinder enemies' attempts to lane as Lion can threaten to remove their mana pool if they remain in the area while he casts this spell on them. It is particularly effective against melee heroes that have to approach the creep wave to last-hit, and used over time it can force them to leave the lane as they will not have the mana to cast any of their spells, including escape abilities in the event of a gank.<br/>While Mana Drain can be a powerful harass tool in the laning stage, it can leave Lion wide open to retaliation since it is a channeled spell that forces him to stand still. Be sure that the enemy is not in a position to jump on him before attempting to cast this spell on them, and that allies are ready to come to your aid if necessary.<br/>Remember that Mana Drain can be cast on any non-friendly unit that has a mana pool, not just enemy heroes. This means that Lion can drain mana from ranged lane creeps, as well as neutral creeps with mana pools. However, keep in mind that casting this spell on neutral creeps will draw aggro, so it is best to cast it when they are otherwise occupied in order to avoid taking damage while draining mana.<br/>Past the laning stage, Mana Drain has strong utility despite its seemingly mediocre effects. Its ability to drain up to 120 MP/sec means that, when combined with other disables, it can completely destroy an enemy's ability to retaliate at all as they will have no mana to cast any spells or use certain active abilities. It can be extremely powerful against heroes with small mana pools that rely on survivability abilities, with Reincarnation being one of the most prominent examples.<br/>Like Hex, Mana Drain is capable of destroying illusions, removing them from play upon the first drain instance (0.1 seconds after casting). As its cooldown and mana cost is even lower than Hex, Mana Drain can effectively destroy an illusion every four seconds.<br/>When used in combination with Earth Spike and Hex, Mana Drain can allow Lion to completely remove Manta Style illusions from the field: use Earth Spike to disable all three targets and identify the real hero by how much damage they take, destroy an illusion with Mana Drain, and follow up with Hex on the hero once Earth Spike's stun ends. The second illusion can be destroyed at leisure once Mana Drain comes off cooldown.<br/>Due to its long cast range, Mana Drain can be used to break an enemy's Linken's Sphere ahead of a fight or gank. However, be very careful when attempting this, as Mana Drain's cast animation can add an additional delay that the enemy can take advantage of.<h4>Finger of Death</h4>Finger of Death is one of the most powerful magic nukes in the game, capable of dealing a tremendous amount of damage to a single target.<br/>In general, it is best to use Finger of Death at the start of an engagement, rather than in an attempt to finish off a foe. Using the nuke on an enemy at the earliest opportunity will ensure that it deals all of its damage rather than a portion of it, and can allow your team to kill the target faster. As well, it is usually wise to try to let your team's carries score the last hit and claim credit for the kill, as they can usually make better use of the gold than Lion can. However, if there is a chance that the target may escape, do not hesitate to take the kill yourself, as getting a kill on the support and assist gold on other teammates is better than missing the kill and everybody getting nothing at all.<br/>Keep in mind that there is a 0.25 second damage delay once Finger of Death connects with a target, meaning that the damage will take effect 0.55 seconds after giving Lion the command. This delay can allow players with quick reaction times to evade its damage and possibly escape death, as activating spell immunity or becoming hidden/invulnerable will effectively dodge the damage, wasting the spell.<br/>Due to its strong nuking potential, Finger of Death can be profitably used on a squishy enemy support rather than trying to damage the enemy carry. At the start of a teamfight, if the opportunity presents itself to instantly remove an enemy player from the field, it can benefit your team far more than dealing more damage to their tanky carry: killing a support at the start will prevent not only any high-impact spells they might otherwise cast, but also any items that could give their team an advantage (such as Mekansm or Crimson Guard). Be sure to use your judgment and choose your targets wisely.<br/>Beware that Finger of Death's nuke can be turned against you if the enemy builds the right items. A Blade Mail can cause Lion to blow himself up as well as the enemy, preventing him from further using his disables in a fight, while a Lotus Orb can amount to the same result, but even worse can potentially allow the enemy to bounce the beam onto Lion's allies. Check the enemy's inventory for such items ahead of time, and be sure to refrain from casting your spells if the enemy attempts to bait you.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Nature's Prophet is a very unorthodox hero most renowned for his ability to push and gank, as his combination of abilities gives him powerful global presence and pushing potential. However, the hero himself is quite frail and can be killed easily if caught by the enemy.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global presence<br/>Great pusher<br/>Powerful late game<br/>Versatility to fit any role<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Farm dependent<br/>Low armor/spell resistance<br/>Squishy early-game<br/>Highly dependent on map awareness<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>Due to his global mobility, map awareness is extremely important with Nature's Prophet. Good Nature's Prophet play requires paying constant attention to the map in order to find opportunities to exploit the enemy's weak spots. Since Teleportation allows Nature's Prophet to quickly re-position himself to any point on the map, he can effectively assist in ganks, help allies in need, aggressively push lanes when the enemy leave them unattended, finish off fleeing enemies, and so on.<br/>Generally, Nature's Prophet can be effective in almost any lane required by his team. His flexibility allows him to perform well in many roles.<br/>Most frequently, Nature's Prophet is played as a jungler, as his ability to summon Treants through Nature's Call allows him to kill neutral camps relatively safely by using the Treants to tank their attacks. While this can end up weakening his team's laning by leaving his safe lane more vulnerable to enemy offlane aggression, it also improves his team's overall economy by allowing four heroes to farm at the same time rather than just three.<br/>Nature's Prophet can also be played as an off-laner, as he can disrupt creep equilibrium by using Nature's Call. By kiting the enemy creep wave using Treants, he can secure last-hits and experience for himself even if the enemy attempts to pull neutral camps. As well, the Treants can disrupt enemy pulls or outright block the pull camp from spawning, as the enemy will be unable to kill Treants in a timely manner in the laning stage.<br/>Unlike most other casting-focused intelligence heroes, Nature's Prophet relies on his physical attacks to deal damage. His respectable base damage, ample attack range and good attack animation give him a strong edge when trading attacks with enemies in the laning stage, and can be a force to be reckoned with when boosted up by farming items that give him more damage and attack speed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Sprout</h4>In general, only one early skill point should be taken in Sprout, as it does not scale as well compared to Nature's Prophet's other spells. While the skill benefits from being maxed out eventually, Nature's Prophet can benefit more in the early game from putting his skill points into other spells.<br/> The most basic use of Sprout is to pen in an enemy hero to block off their movement so that they can be focused down and killed. Keep in mind, however, that the trees can still be destroyed by items such as  and , both of which are common in the early game, as well as abilities such as  and . As such, be careful not to assume that it will be a foolproof way to trap enemies.
<br/>Conversely to the above, however, Sprout can be a powerful spell in the late game, when nobody has a Quelling Blade or Tango anymore. Against the right line-ups, it can potentially lock down enemies for its full duration, as spell immunity will not allow them to path through the trees, meaning that their only method of escape will be through their own abilities (which can be silenced) or items such as Battle Fury or Force Staff, which may not always be on hand.<br/>When casting Sprout to hinder enemies' pathing, remember that it does not have to be targeted directly on an enemy. Placing the trees to block an enemy's path can limit their escape options (such as forcing them to run towards your allies), or can prevent reinforcements from coming to their teammate's aid by halting their approach and splitting the battlefield. Try to be creative with how you use Sprout, as its low cooldown, long cast range and high duration allow it to be cast multiple times in a single engagement to great effect.<br/>Remember that at level 1, Sprout lasts for 3 seconds, exactly enough time to channel Teleportation or to use a Town Portal Scroll (provided you are not teleporting to a building that an ally has recently teleported to). As such, it can be used to shroud yourself in the fog of war while escaping, but beware that enemies can still use area-targeted disables to stop you in your tracks, or can simply destroy the trees to reveal you for a unit-targeted disable.<br/>Sprout provides flying vision within the ring, as well as in an area around it. This allows it to be used to give vision over obstacles such as high ground, or to completely reveal an area that an enemy may be trying to juke through to escape. In a pinch, it can also be used for de-warding by providing vision over elevated ward spots.<br/>Sprout can be used to protect allies, not just to pin down enemies. If an ally is running away, casting Sprout in the enemy's path can block off their chase route, forcing them to path around to pursue. However, be extremely careful not to accidentally pen in allies with this spell, as you may accidentally secure a kill for the enemy instead.<br/>Keep in mind that certain allied spells can be cast in tandem with Sprout to create extremely powerful combinations. For instance, Shackleshot can be virtually guaranteed to latch for its full duration, Mystic Flare can focus its full power on an immobilized target, Static Link and Eye of the Storm can run for a much longer duration, Timber Chain can be used to quickly move to a destination where there would normally not be trees, and so on. Be creative with how you use Sprout if a teammate can benefit from it.<h4>Teleportation</h4>With one early skill point in this ability, Nature's Prophet gains tremendous global mobility. As the only constraint on this spell is the 3 second cast animation, he can appear anywhere on the map that he wishes. This allows Nature's Prophet to show up to ganks even if he's on the other side of the map, and possibly use Sprout to aid his teammates in disabling and focusing down an enemy.<br/>Remember that this ability has a 3 second cast animation, and is not a channeled spell. This means that, at any time during the 3 second delay, you can cancel it and choose a different place to teleport to, without incurring the mana cost or cooldown. This can be used to fake out the enemy into maneuvering down a different path to avoid your arrival, to choose a different arrival point to better suit an evolving situation, and so on. However, beware that cancelling the animation means that you will delay your arrival by that much longer, which may result in you arriving too late to make a difference.<br/>With good timing and possibly assisting ward vision, Teleportation can be used to kill the enemy's courier as it is en route to deliver items. This can be particularly effective if you can kill the courier before it can deliver a Bottle to the enemy's mid, giving your mid player a firm advantage. It is advised, however, to carry a Town Portal Scroll when attempting this, as you may require a speedy escape in order to avoid being caught and killed.<br/>Judicious use of this ability is what makes Nature's Prophet such a powerful hero. If the enemy is seen using their Town Portal Scrolls to teleport to one lane, you can cast Teleportation to jump to another lane and then quickly push it and attempt to take a tower if the creep wave is close. If a low-HP enemy hero is seen retreating after an engagement, you can interdict them and kill them before they get back to their fountain. If an ally is engaging an enemy in a one-on-one fight and neither side has teammates nearby, you can teleport in to turn it into an uneven match and secure a kill. Proper use of this ability requires strong map awareness and good judgment.<h4>Nature's Call</h4>Nature's Call allows Nature's Prophet to summon Treants to do his bidding. It is a very flexible spell that is most powerful in the early game, but requires good micromanagement in order to get the most benefit out of the ability.<br/>Never underestimate the survivability of Treants in the laning stage of the game. They possess 550 HP at all points in the game, rivaling that of heroes in the beginning. As such, they can be used for multiple purposes such as scouting out pre-rune aggression, physically blocking enemy pull camps, and so on.<br/>In general, Treants are used to assist Nature's Prophet in jungling in the early game, as they can deal additional damage to neutral camps while tanking creep attacks, keeping Nature's Prophet safe from harm; as such, it is generally the most important spell to max out in the early game. Remember to micromanage Treants so that they do not get killed by creeps, as even low-health Treants can still contribute attack damage to increase the rate of farming.<br/>Treants can act as strong lane pushers past the early game. Not only can they add their attack power to a pushing creep wave, they can soak up tower hits and can be maneuvered to kite away approaching enemy creeps to delay defenders from arriving. They can also provide vision behind towers and around treelines to spot any enemy attempts to teleport in.<br/>Keep in mind, Nature's Call will destroy all trees in its area. This can be used to allow easier transit between neutral camps while jungling, destroying enemy juke paths, and so on. However, also remember that trees take 5 minutes to respawn after destruction, so it can be beneficial to target the spell such that only the minimum number of trees are destroyed per cast, in order to preserve some trees for later summons.<br/>Trees created by Sprout are valid targets for Nature's Call. This means that should Nature's Prophet need reinforcements in an area outside of the jungle (such as pushing up the enemy's high ground or while within the enemy's base), casting Sprout first will allow him to summon Treants wherever they are needed.<br/>Nature's Call can be used to great effect for scouting enemy player movement prior to the horn, particularly around the rune spots. Cast Nature's Call a bit after the minute mark (around 0:55 or 0:50), and then maneuver one Treant to the areas around each rune spot. While they cannot block the enemy from picking up the rune, they can scout out enemy positions, giving your team valuable intelligence and allow them to re-position to engage the enemy as needed. Be sure to maneuver the Treants and avoid feeding them to the enemy, as they do provide a small gold and experience bounty.<br/>If your Treants are about to expire and cannot be readily used to farm another neutral camp, it can be useful to maneuver them to the rune spots prior to the even-minute mark. They can be used to scout out and guard the runes for your mid player, and under optimal circumstances can deny runes for the opposing mid player.<br/> Treants become less effective as games progress, as they eventually become easy fodder for enemy heroes. However, they still provide useful service when utilized properly.
<br/>As they are still treated as regular units, Treants can be used to frustrate enemy attempts at using their spells. For instance, they can physically block attempts to hit heroes with spells such as Meat Hook, Hookshot and Sacred Arrow, and can act as additional targets for random-target area spells such as Chain Frost, Rocket Barrage, Paralyzing Cask, Soul Catcher, and so on.<br/>Treants can give vision and can be directly controlled, allowing them to be used to gather intelligence. They can scout out dangerous areas for enemy movement (such as checking behind treelines for hiding initiators), increase your vision radius at night by placing them at the outer perimeters of your team's location, look inside Roshan's pit, and so on.<h4>Wrath of Nature</h4>Generally, Wrath of Nature is best used to halt enemy pushes, or add an initiation nuke to a gank. It should generally not be used to farm lane creeps around the map every time it is off cooldown, as this can take away farm from teammates and push creep waves, giving teammates less safe places to farm.<br/>Remember that Wrath of Nature deals more damage to the units hit at the end of its duration, so skillful use of this spell requires targeting it to land on as many units as possible prior to reaching your intended target, but without overrunning the unit cap. Watch your mini-map for how many possible targets there are currently, and cast the spell at the right moment. If your target is in the bottom lane, target the spell on the top lane to give it units to build up on, and vice versa.<br/>Wrath of Nature can be used to effectively stall enemy pushes and give them pause. If the enemy is attempting to push a tower, using the spell can deal heavy damage to their creep wave and any heroes within vision, possibly killing their whole creep wave and preventing them from effectively pushing. To the same purpose, it can be used to push out lanes so that your team can more easily take towers.<br/>Wrath of Nature can be useful for starting up a nuke prior to ganking an enemy. If cast right before initiating with Teleportation, it can hit enemy creeps to build up its damage before arriving at the gank target, striking them shortly before Nature's Prophet emerges.<br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, the overall nuking power of Wrath of Nature increases, giving it a greater chance to kill any creep it strikes and summoning a Treant for every successful kill. This can greatly augment Nature's Prophet's ability to push, as every successful kill will also summon instant reinforcements for that lane to increase its pushing power.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Necrophos is a highly survivable intelligence hero whose power scale with how long he survives in a fight and eventually how long the game becomes due to his capability of taking out crucial targets and pro-longing their death with his ultimate Reaper's Scythe. Despite having a heal in his kit, Necrophos is not supportive by nature and should not be used as one as for a support, healing is all he can contribute and he is not that good at it.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deceptively durable when played correctly.<br/>Very effective in any teamfight, especially long ones.<br/>Fairly straightforward with his spells, making him easy to play.<br/>Can lengthen respawn times of key enemy Heroes, or those that bought back.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slightly item dependent.<br/>Not naturally durable.<br/>Not too reliable escape mechanism.<br/>Sluggish movement speed.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Necrophos is countered in lane by any hero with high health regeneration, such as Dragon Knight and Quas-focused Invoker, or a hero with lifesteal capabilities; because he relies on inflicting constant, gradual damage with Death Pulse and Heartstopper Aura. Heroes with these attributes will resist this in lane against Necrophos, keeping high enough health to prevent death by Reaper's Scythe.<br/>Refresher Orb combined with an Aghanim's Scepter will greatly increase your chance at winning the match if it reaches the late game. If you manage to kill 2 enemy heroes in succession, the sheer duration of their respawn time might be enough to decide the match, more so if the victims are key heroes in their lineup.<br/>Necrophos can very easily be built as a tank and in most circumstances should be; you may gear for strength (he does not need excessive intelligence as his basic attacks are not too useful, and Death Pulse refunds mana for each kill he gets). The reason he is usually built as a tank is because he needs to stay alive in violent encounters to heal his allies (a good enemy team will focus him first), and also because the longer he is alive for, the more damage his aura will do and the better chance he has of landing a crucial Reaper's Scythe.<br/> Although it may be wise to build some mana pool increasing items such as , Point Booster or other Intelligence items may do so anyway; because if Necrophos has used all his abilities and failed to get a kill, he would wind up and be unable to cast any more of his spells. Moreover, if his auto attack is not too great, getting last hits to regenerate some mana can be problematic.
<br/>Utility items, such as Mekansm, Pipe of Insight and Guardian Greaves are more useful for Necrophos, because he can inflict constant damage with Heartstopper Aura simply by avoiding death and synergizes with his Death Pulse to keep his team alive. In that sense, Crimson Guard is also a viable luxury item for Utility Necrophos as it will greatly increase his durability while also providing a useful team ability.<br/>Radiance is a viable item for Necrophos because of his durability. This also synergizes well with Heartstopper Aura making prolonged team-fights a dangerous prospect for the enemy team.<br/>Necrophos is effective against invisible heroes that tend to stalk their prey as his Heartstopper Aura does damage while they are in stealth, his Death Pulse hits invisible units, and his Reaper's Scythe will prevent them from escaping via invisibility before they die. He is also very good against heroes with abilities that deplete their own health such as Pudge, Slark, and Centaur Warrunner ( Huskar is an exception since his Berserker's Blood will almost always prevent you from killing him with Reaper's Scythe), but Necrophos should first be durable enough to take on these kinds of risk/reward heroes.<br/>Necrophos' role is notoriously debated; while his abilities appear supportive at their core, his Reaper's Scythe is a tool used to secure kills only for himself (much like Axe's Culling Blade). This is atypical for a standard support hero, because supports usually attempt to confer gold and experience to the team's carry. The duplicity of his carry/support role stems from his unique stance in encounters; his kit is largely supportive until an enemy hero grows weak, at which point Necrophos has the capacity to kill said enemy himself. He is best viewed as a utility focused semi-carry, rather than a full-fledged support hero.<br/>Dagon is more useful on Necrophos than other heroes because it not only deals burst damage, but also allows you to quickly deal more damage from your ultimate.<br/>  can be used in conjunction with  and  to deal significantly more damage. If you are also in a possession of a high level , a quick Reaper's Scythe to Ether Blast to Energy Burst combo can decimate full health enemy heroes with total health points lower than 2000, assuming they have the standard 25% magic resistance.
<br/>It is worth noting that Ether Blast temporarily increases the magical damage dealt per missing health from the standard 0.4/0.6/0.9 to 0.56/0.84/1.26, thus also increases the instant-kill threshold.<br/>Assuming a level 5 Energy Burst and a level 3 Reaper's Scythe with an Aghanim's Scepter is used against an enemy with 25% magic resistance while being ethereal, you will deal 840 damage from Dagon and 1058.4 damage from Reaper's Scythe, to a total of 1898.4 damage (not including damage from Ether Blast and Reaper's Scythe damage due to it). If the match reaches the late-game, you still can burst down a full health non-magic-immune enemy carry with standard magic resistance during teamfights, potentially turning it into your team's favor.<br/>Octarine Core is a viable item if you plan to do an aggressive approach as your Death Pulse will heal Necrophos for 130 + 50 per hero hit and reduce its cooldown to 3.75 seconds. If you also manage to kill an enemy with Reaper's Scythe, the massive damage coupled with the heal from Death Pulse will in some cases be enough to heal Necrophos from critically low health to full health. However, it is advised that you build a Bloodstone too because the Octarine Core will increase your mana consumption and is a lot less effective than Bloodstone at restoring mana.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Death Pulse</h4>As Necrophos's survivability heavily relies on his ability to spam Death Pulse you need to be wary of heroes with silence such as Drow Ranger, Silencer and Death Prophet. Ancient Apparition can also greatly cripple you with Ice Blast as this ability prevents health from regenerating for an extended period of time.<br/>With a Bloodstone, he can keep the pressure up at the enemy lanes and prevent the enemy team from farming. If you can get it early enough, you can choose to build it before Mekansm and/or Pipe of Insight because it will drastically improve your survivability and so that you can store enough charges.<br/>The passive portion of the ability applies to and is triggered by any kills made by Necrophos. The killing blow does not need to be with Death Pulse specifically.<h4>Ghost Shroud</h4> Ghost Shroud applies an Ethereal status, disarming and rendering Necrophos unable to perform basic attacks.
<br/>Spells and abilities that apply a similar Ethereal status does not multiplicatively stack with one another, and only the strongest spell-resistance reducing modifier is applied.<br/>Ghost Shroud shields you entirely from physical damage, but increases your vulnerability to magical damage. Be wary of the circumstances before casting this spell.<br/> Any form of health and mana recovery is amplified, so it works with the health and mana restoration of spells like  and items like .
<br/> Ghost Shroud only amplifies any health and mana restoration that Necrophos receives from all sources and does not actually amplify the health and mana restoration of his other spells.
<br/>This means that while under the effects of Ghost Shroud, Death Pulse will have a greater healing effect upon Necrophos, but Death pulse itself is not amplified and will not heal allies for a greater amount than stated in the spell description.<br/>Ghost Shroud applies an area move speed slow centred around Necrophos, similar to Degen Aura, making it a good skill to chase down heroes or to impede their own chasing efforts upon you or your allies.<br/>Ghost Shroud is immediately dispelled when Necrophos is rendered spell immune, so it cannot be used in conjunction with Repel or Black King Bar.<br/>Items and spells can be used and activated without causing Ghost Shroud to be dispelled (with the exception of Black King Bar).<h4>Heartstopper Aura</h4> Heartstopper Aura in the early game allows  to harass enemy heroes by simply standing near them. Its massive radius will usually cause heroes to run out of their early game regeneration items quite fast.
<br/>Note however that the aura affects enemy creeps, and thus putting points in it will push the lane. Should you lane with a farm-dependent carry, it is unwise to push as it makes their farm more difficult and leaves both of you more vulnerable to ganks. Putting one or at the most two points in it is appropriate for early game.<br/>If you're against a defensive tri-lane or playing as an Offlaner and the enemies in the lane lack disables, maxing Heartstopper Aura first is a viable option if the enemy chooses to play passively. The massive degeneration will make it hard for the enemy to farm and in some cases they might ignore Necrophos until it is too late and their health is low enough for a kill with Reaper's Scythe or make them vulnerable to a gank. The same can be said if you are in a defensive trilane and the enemy has a tanky offlaner.<br/>Don't neglect to use basic attacks to harass the enemy during laning phase. Heartstopper Aura already negates their regeneration or at least hinder it significantly if they bought/rushed health regen items like Ring of Regen and Ring of Health in anticipation. Even attacking them once in a while goes a long way because they can't readily recuperate the loss of health and will eventually force them to use their consumables or retreat.<br/>If you are going for an early push strategy, an early Headdress in conjunction with your aura will work wonders and will make the lane a battle of attrition that they will lose from either using too much regen items or being too afraid to last hit. Unless of course, they have a naturally high health regen.<br/>Due to the large range of Heartstopper Aura, heroes that practice Armlet of Mordiggian toggling will be forced to stop toggling below 450 health at teamfights as turning off Unholy Strength will reduce their health to 1 and will die from Heartstopper Aura immediately after. If you are also a support and is not hard pressed to last hit, the range will also allow you to hide in trees to harass the enemy heroes in the lane without them knowing.<h4>Reaper's Scythe</h4> At level 3, Reaper's Scythe will kill targets at 40% or less health. Remember to factor in magic resistance from items and abilities before you attempt to execute an enemy Hero with it.
<br/>The Reaper's Scythe instant-kill health threshold, with the base 25% magic resist factored in, can be calculated by multiplying the enemy max health with the constants: 3/13, 9/29, or 27/67 for each respective level of the ultimate.<br/> The philosophy behind  is that (owing to ) it will return its mana expenditure if you secure a kill.
<br/> Due to the damage mechanics of the spell, many player would preferably want to secure a kill in order to recoup the mana spent in casting it. However, there are several situations in which this ability should be used purely for its stun, such as interrupting channeled ultimates (such as those belonging to  or ) or preventing an enemy hero from escaping.
<br/>Take note that the stun goes through magic immunity, although the damage will not.<br/> Keep in mind that Reaper's Scythe is not a channeling ability, meaning you can move the moment you have cast it. As such, it can be used to escape ganks and chases.
<br/>Because you can cast during the stun, you can use it to initiate on an enemy hero to keep them from escaping or using Black King Bar assuming you can cause enough damage in 1.5 seconds. You can instant-kill with this tactic if you are paired with a high burst damage hero such as Huskar or Lina or Lion, or if you are in possession of a high level Dagon and an Ethereal Blade.<br/> Remember that this ultimate adds additional time to its victim's respawn timer In later stages of the game this can prove very important in removing key enemy heroes from the fight for a very long time.
<br/>If the situation permits, you should focus on using Reaper's Scythe only on the same enemy (preferably the carry) throughout the match. The extension of the respawn time will add up and will cause a significant reduction to the enemy's farm. To put it into perspective, if you manage to kill the same enemy hero twice, it will already make their farm a minute late more than usual if killed by anybody else. This will cause heroes who depend on snowballing early like Pudge to become almost useless in mid to late game as their chance to snowball will be greatly reduced, or make the enemy carry under-prepared to tackle your team's carry hero.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ogre Magi is the embodiment of "dumb muscle". While having a meager mana pool for an intelligence hero, his health pool can become one of the largest in the game.

Your stun and slow should make getting kills really easy<br/>Manage your mana. Ogre can run out really quickly if you're not careful, so try not to use more than is needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fireblast</h4> Use this to stop foes from escaping or channeling spells. Follow up with  to ensure your allies can catch up to the target.
<br/>Alternatively, consider casting Ignite first to slow you opponents down in order for you to catch up and follow-up with Fireblast, as Ignite has a much greater cast range than Fireblast.<br/>If Multicast procs, it increases the damage and the stun duration. At 4x multicast it essentially doubles the stun from 1.5 seconds to 3 seconds.<br/>With 0/1/2/3 points in Multicast, Fireblast will deal on average 220/308/418/544.5 damage (before spell amp and magic resistance).<br/>Be wary of your mana consumption once you start having levels in Multicast, as each level of Multicast increases the mana cost of Fireblast.<h4>Do not discount the damage done by Ignite, as it has the potential to deal heavy damage (400 at maximum level) in an area once Multicast is learnt, making it a very good pushing/counter-pushing skill.</h4>BloodlustBloodlust works best if you cast it onto your carry before a fight begins to give them a decent attack and movement speed boost.<br/>Bloodlust can be used to help you and your allies escape with the bonus movement speed.<br/>Bloodlust can be cast on towers to increase the odds of them killing low health enemies who are in the radius of the tower.<br/> Bloodlust will be cast on random allies in the vicinity if  procs. Additionally, each point in Multicast also lowers the cooldown, making it easier to keep it up on everyone.
<br/>Targets are chosen at random, so Heroes are not prioritised when Multicast procs.<br/> Bloodlust will target nearby Heroes automatically if set on autocast. Be careful of your mana usage, as with the low cooldown period, you may inadvertently find yourself out of mana in a crucial moment.
<br/>Bloodlust will only be automatically cast is your allies do not currently have the Bloodlust buff on them.<br/>Autocast will interrupt your current queue order, but will not cause you to disengage a channeling ability.<h4>Bloodlust works best if you cast it onto your carry before a fight begins to give them a decent attack and movement speed boost.</h4>Multicast Gives passive changes to all of Magi's abilities minus .
<br/>Fireblast has its mana cost increased by 20/40/60 and cooldown lowered by 2/4/6 per level.<br/>Ignite is given 150/300/450 AoE and casting range increase.<br/>Bloodlust gets a 5/10/15 second cooldown reduction.<br/> Gives additional effects to all of Ogre's abilities that stack based on how much Multicast procced.
<br/>Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast both indirectly gain increased damage and stun through multiple cast of the spell.<br/>Ignite can jump to nearby enemies.<br/>Bloodlust is cast on nearby allies.<h4>Gives passive changes to all of Magi's abilities minus Unrefined Fireblast. Fireblast has its mana cost increased by 20/40/60 and cooldown lowered by 2/4/6 per level. Ignite is given 150/300/450 AoE and casting range increase. Bloodlust gets a 5/10/15 second cooldown reduction.</h4>Unrefined Fireblast Essentially the same as  but with a different mana cost mechanic.
<br/>Unrefined Fireblast has a naturally higher damage and lower cooldown than Fireblast.<br/>Does not need Multicast leveled, but does need Aghanim's Scepter to unlock and use.<br/> Always uses 60% of your current mana, meaning it's most effective when used when almost out of mana instead of when you're nearly at full mana.
<br/>Because of this, you can also always use this ability no matter how low your mana is.<br/>Be careful of your mana usage when you cast this at full mana, as it will severely deplete your mana pool and limit your other spellcasting and item usage.<br/>With 0/1/2/3 points in Multicast, Unrefined Fireblast will deal on average 275/385/522.5/680.6 damage (before spell amp and magic resistance).<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Oracle is a versatile spell caster whose spells can be used defensively or offensively depending on how the combinations of spells are used. A well timed ultimate can change a surprise attack from the enemy into a failed gank. Oracle is not very mobile and is susceptible to getting picked or focused first in fights if poorly positioned.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong spammable nukes<br/>Great spell utility, Fate's Edict can be used to negate magical damage or disarm opponents for example.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Lacks any strong area of effect spells<br/>Inexperienced players might cause more harm than good to their team or aid the enemy if they cast the wrong spells at the wrong time<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Oracle's strength lies not in his individual spells, but in how he utilizes his spells in combination with each other, as well as those of his teammates. This means that playing Oracle effectively requires communication and coordination with allied players, as well as good reflexes and knowledge of what each ability does.<br/>Like most other intelligence supports, Oracle suffers from poor strength and agility, making him extremely vulnerable to any types of damage. Because of his array of abilities, Oracle should build items that provide mobility rather than survivability, since he can use mobility items both to position himself for casting his spells and to escape enemy attempts to kill him. As well, his heavy reliance on spell casting means that he should invest in increasing the size of his mana pool and acquiring a reliable source of mana replenishment.<br/>Be mindful that while Oracle has strong healing and nuking abilities, he possesses no hard disables, meaning that he is unable to interrupt channeling items/abilities, nor is he able to prevent enemies from casting spells or using items. In order to counter enemy spell and item usage, Oracle must himself purchase items to allow him to hard-disable the enemy, or rely on his allies to do so.<br/>Oracle's spells all have very high cast ranges, and his good base movement speed allows him to get into position to use his spells relatively easily. However, his extremely low turn rate means that he cannot maneuver as easily as other heroes, so his ability to turn around to cast spells in surprise situations may allow the enemy to catch him off-guard. This means that prior knowledge of the enemy's positions and movements can allow him to orient himself to face the threat axis and be ready to use his spells immediately, making ward vision very important.<br/>With his long attack range, respectable cast animation, and extremely low base attack time, Oracle is a very powerful harasser in the laning stage, able to inflict harass damage on enemy heroes safely and frequently, as well as deny effectively with his respectable base damage. Combined with his array of impact-heavy abilities and high base movement speed, this allows Oracle to be a very strong lane support who can very easily protect his safe lane carry.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fortune's End</h4>Fortune's End is a channeled nuke that damages enemies in an area around the target, while purging them and immobilizing them based on the channel duration.<br/>Because its damage and cooldown scale as it is leveled up, Fortune's End is a good spell to max out early in the game. Leveling up the ability increases Oracle's ability to nuke and disable enemies, and the dispel has strong utility depending on the types of buffs that the enemy is depending on.<br/>Fortune's End is a very flexible nuke that can be used in a number of ways. Chief among its utility is to deal nuke damage to an enemy while removing buffs, or to stop an enemy for the channeled duration as a follow-up disable from an allied initiation.<br/>Be mindful that no matter how long Fortune's End is channeled, it will deal the same amount of damage regardless. Channeling Fortune's End for a longer duration only increases the amount of time that affected enemies are immobilized, so if the aim of casting the spell is to simply deal damage and/or purge rather than disable, the spell can be immediately released in order to give the enemy less time to react.<br/>With regards to the immobilization, keep in mind that it is not a root, and therefore will not prevent the enemy from casting escape/survivability spells. However, it will forcibly reduce the target's movement speed to 0, which allows it to affect enemies in different ways (similar to Kinetic Field). This makes it a strong chasing and immobilizing spell as it takes priority over haste abilities such as Stampede and Shapeshift.<br/>Never discount the area purging and immobilizing that Fortune's End can provide. If the spell can land on a clumped up group of enemies, the amount of damage it deals increases severalfold, along with purging many more buffs from the enemy and pinning them down for follow-up area disables by teammates.<br/>Be careful about using Fortune's End as an initiating disable. Because the enemy can see the spell effects even if Oracle himself is not visible, they will immediately know that they are being targeted by the spell, and can immediately retreat to avoid being caught in a disadvantageous position, or easily disjoint the projectile.<br/>Unlike most other purging-type spells, Fortune's End can still target invulnerable units (it is still blocked by spell immunity, however). This makes it a very powerful ability since it can forcibly remove certain instances of invulnerability, particularly a self-cast Eul's Scepter of Divinity.<h4>Fate's Edict</h4>Fate's Edict inflicts its target with a disarm while increasing their magic resistance to 100%. It can be cast on allies and enemies alike.<br/>Because its duration only scales by 0,5 second for each level, Fate's Edict is best left at level 1 until both Fortune's End and Purifying Flames are maxed out. However, its strong utility means that an early value point can be very strong as it greatly synergizes with Oracle's other spells.<br/> Generally, Fate's Edict has two primary purposes: protecting allies from magic nukes, or disarming enemies to prevent them from attacking.
<br/>Casting Fate's Edict on fleeing allies can save them from incoming magic nukes, particularly long-ranged single-shot ones like Assassinate and Thundergod's Wrath, and can be used to mitigate the effects damage-over-time debuffs such as Ice Blast and Poison Nova. Properly used, Fate's Edict can allow Oracle to defy his allies' fates by preventing their deaths due to magical damage.<br/>Casting Fate's Edict on enemies during a fight can render them unable to attack, important for stopping their right-click carries from attacking. If the enemy does not have any dispel abilities or items, a good Fate's Edict can render their carry unable to attack for a period of time, greatly increasing the odds of winning a teamfight.<br/>Be very careful about when you cast Fate's Edict on an ally or enemy. Using the ability on an ally in the middle of a fight can prevent them from attacking, hindering their ability to kill enemies, while using it on an enemy can shield them from incoming allied magic nukes. Use your best judgment as to when Fate's Edict can be most profitably used, as casting it on the wrong target at the wrong time can reduce your team's chances at emerging victorious in an engagement.<br/>It is possible to manually remove Fate's Edict from an enemy via the use of Fortune's End. If an enemy affected by Fate's Edict is fleeing and needs to be finished off with magic nukes, casting Fortune's End on them will remove it from them, while dealing nuke damage and immobilizing them to allow allies to follow up.<br/>Fate's Edict can also be used as a simple magic resistance buff on allies that do not rely on auto-attacks to be effective. For instance, casting Fate's Edict can allow a teammate to walk into an active Freezing Field to cast an interrupting disable, or ignore most of Leshrac's damage output while directly engaging him with spells.<br/> The magic resistance of Fate's Edict can synergize greatly with many other effects in the game.
<br/>An ally affected by Cold Embrace is immune to physical damage but can still be bursted down by Magical and Pure. Casting Fate's Edict on the target can shield them from magic nukes for the duration of the disable, and the disarm can be neglected due to the target being unable to act anyways.<br/>Any form of ethereal will leave its target unable to attack or be affected by physical damage, but decreases their magic resistance at the same time. Casting Fate's Edict in such a situation would render them invulnerable to magical damage as well, and the target will have already been disarmed by the ethereal form.<h4>Purifying Flames</h4>Purifying Flames is an extremely low cooldown magic nuke that applies a healing buff to its target. It can be cast on allies and enemies.<br/>As a multipurpose heal and nuke, Purifying Flames is a very powerful spell to max out first. Its damage scales much higher than Fortune's End, and the heal can be very powerful at all points in the game.<br/> Oracle's greatest strength is his ability to combine Purifying Flames with his other abilities, using them to completely change how it benefits his team and debilitates the enemy.
<br/>The 100% magic resistance element of Fate's Edict can be used to great effect when combined with Purifying Flames. Casting Fate's Edict on an ally first, followed by Purifying Flames, will cause allies to take no damage from the nuke portion, and benefit only from the healing portion. As Purifying Flames can be stacked, higher levels of Fate's Edict allows Oracle to heal allies for larger amounts of HP per cast.<br/>Fortune's End can purge positive buffs from enemies, Purifying Flames included. Casting Purifying Flames on an enemy first, then hitting them with Fortune's End, will cause them to be healed for the minimal amount of HP while taking the full brunt of the nuke damage from both spells.<br/>Be wary that the damage portion of Purifying Flames will always take magic resistance into account, whether it is cast on an ally or enemy. This means that unless the target is inflicted with powerful magic resistance debuffs, they will always be healed for more HP than the damage taken. This means that abilities such as Spell Shield and Berserker's Blood can greatly mitigate the nuke portion of Purifying Flames, which can be a boon or a hindrance depending on which team possesses either hero.<br/>The short cooldown and small mana cost on Purifying Flames allows it to be used as a basic nuke. This can be used either to finish off low-health enemies, or score easy last-hits. Beware, however, that unless the target is killed quickly, they can eventually heal up a large amount of HP, which may necessitate the use of Fortune's End.<br/>When using Purifying Flames in combination with Fortune's End to nuke enemies, keep in mind that Fortune's End has a travel time, while Purifying Flames will instantly apply its effects at the end of its cast animation. Start the attack, wait for the projectile to appear, and with the right timing of Purifying Flames the nuke will hit just before the projectile lands. Or, if an enemy is within range of Purifying Flames but is more than 400 range away, Fortune's End can be channeled first and then interrupted with Purifying Flames; the enemy will take the damage from Purifying Flames during the travel time of Fortune's End, and then immediately have the healing buff removed and be nuked by Fortune's End.<br/>Purifying Flames, by itself, will never be lethal to allies. This allows Oracle to save time by directly casting Purifying Flames on a low-health ally rather than consuming time and mana with Fate's Edict first. However, be sure to check for damage over time debuffs first, and never do this if an enemy is nearby, as it can put teammates low enough for the enemy to easily finish off.<br/> As with Fate's Edict, Purifying Flames can be used to great effect depending on what heroes are present on Oracle's team.
<br/>In the case of an ally being shielded by Cold Embrace and Fate's Edict, Purifying Flames can be added on top to further magnify the healing effect of Cold Embrace, significantly boosting the amount of HP healed inside of a few seconds.<br/>If the enemy has been affected by Ice Blast, repeatedly nuking them with Purifying Flames can prevent them from benefiting from the heal for the duration of the debuff, especially if the allied Ancient Apparition has an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/>Beware that Purifying Flames is still registered as player damage, even when targeted on an ally, and can trigger on-damage effects. This means that it can remove layers of Refraction, Living Armor and Gravekeeper's Cloak if not shielded by Fate's Edict first, and can cancel Clarity, Healing Salve and Urn of Shadows even if Fate's Edict was cast first; it can even put an allied Blink Dagger on cooldown at an inopportune moment if not shielded by Fate's Edict first. Be careful about when you use Purifying Flames to heal allies, as using it even in situations with no present threats can be a detriment to your team.<br/> Purifying Flames is a strong lane control spell as it can be used to secure last hits and denies as the spell has a relatively low mana cost and it does not have a projectile.
<br/>A neat trick about Purifying Flames is that it can act as a pseudo Sacrifice from level 2 and above. Simply cast it on your range creep and start denying it before it heals past the 50% threshold.<h4>False Promise</h4>False Promise temporarily delays all damage and healing done to an ally, while constantly applying a strong dispel on them, dealing its damage and double the heal at the end of the duration.<br/>The delayed damage at the end of the spell can be lethal, meaning that the target for False Promise is not guaranteed to live. However, all healing done during the spell is doubled, which means that enough healing items and abilities can allow Oracle to save an ally from the brink of death and restore them to full health at the end of the spell.<br/>Constant use of Purifying Flames during False Promise, along with any other healing spells and items, are key to allowing a teammate to survive at the end of the spell, as the doubled healing portion will allow the target to recover far more health than the damage they take from the nuke portion. Depending on the situation, casting Fate's Edict first may or may not be a good idea, as the disarm can prevent the target from attacking during the spell despite the strong dispel.<br/>Because the heal is doubled at the end of the spell, False Promise greatly benefits from healing sources that are not Oracle himself. Abilities like Chemical Rage, Inner Vitality, Death Pulse and so on can go a long way towards ensuring the survival of the target at the end of the spell.<br/>Beware that it is still possible for a False Promise target to be disabled during the spell, as area disables like Chronosphere, Black Hole, Static Storm and Smoke Screen do not place a dispellable debuff on the affected units. As well, spells like Doom and Demonic Purge place debuffs that cannot be dispelled. Take the enemy's spell composition into account when using False Promise, as casting it on the wrong target or at the wrong time can still waste the spell.<br/> The damage vs healing calculation does not take into account whether the damage is non-lethal or lethal. While the damage from Purifying Flames is normally non-lethal, it nevertheless still contributes fully to the damage calculations.
<br/>Example 1: Unit A is on 100 HP. Oracle casts False Promise on Unit A. Unit B deals 700 damage to Unit A. Oracle casts Purifying Flames twice to Unit A, dealing 600 damage but healing 1000 during the remaining of the False Promise duration. Total damage = 1300. Total healing = 1000. Therefore, once False Promise ends, Unit B lands the killing blow of 100 damage onto Unit A.<br/>Example 2: Unit A is on 700 hp. Oracle casts False Promise on Unit A. Unit B deals 600 damage to Unit A. Near the end of the False Promise duration, Oracle casts Purifying Flames on Unit A, dealing 300 damage and only healing for 100. Total damage = 900. Healing = 50. Therefore, once False Promise ends, Unit B deals 600 damage to Unit A, and Oracle deals 99 (non-lethal) damage to Unit A, leaving Unit A at 1 hp.<br/>Casting Purifying Flames with less than 5 seconds of False Promise remaining is thus not a good idea.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Outworld Devourer is a carry and a disabler. He is one of the few damage dealers who can also reset fights, break chain stuns, and save teammates thanks to his Astral Imprisonment. He is also one of the few heroes who can reliably deal pure damage thanks to Arcane Orb, which can also steal intelligence from heroes and does extra damage against summons and illusions. Nearby allies benefit from Essence Aura as they have a chance to regain a percentage of their max mana each spell cast. Finally, Sanity's Eclipse not only deals damage in a large radius based on Outworld Devourer's current intelligence, but also remove 40% of their maximum mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals massive amounts of pure damage.<br/>Capable of snowballing out of control.<br/>Punishes mana dependent and low intelligence heroes.<br/>High starting move speed.<br/>Chain stun breaker<br/>Excellent gank setup<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Damage is nullified by spell immunity or when silenced.<br/>Ineffective vs high intelligence heroes.<br/>Bad at destroying buildings.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Stealing intelligence from enemy heroes for 80 seconds (140 with the talent) can make a big difference between enemy heroes and give you a high advantage.<br/>At level 7 (which is where Essence Aura can be maxed out) with Power Treads to intelligence, 2x Null Talisman, Force Staff (or Staff of Wizardry because it have same intelligence) and 8-10 intelligence steal from enemy hero or Point Booster (to Aghanim's Scepter for great crowd control) its nearly impossible to lose your mana.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arcane Orb</h4>Arcane Orb is incredibly costly as an auto skill, and as such, you should only invest into it when you have the mana capacity to sustain it.<br/>This is your main damaging ability later on in the game. As an intelligence carry, you directly benefit from items which increase your intelligence due to the increase in your right-click damage, mana pool and resultant Arcane Orb damage.<br/>Arcane Orb deals pure damage, making it a great skill to harass enemies with very high armor.<br/> Due to Outworld Devourer's skill set, Arcane Orb would be your main consumption, and recovery, of mana.
<br/>Casting Arcane Orb on neutral or enemy creeps is a good way to recover lost mana, provided that you have learnt Essence Aura, as the pseudo-random distribution mechanic will eventually guarantee a proc by Essence Aura.<h4>Astral Imprisonment</h4>The first point should generally be invested in Astral Imprisonment, as Arcane Orb is too costly early game and your mana pool is too low for it to be an effective use of mana consumption for pure damage.<br/> Astral Imprisonment's supportive utility allows for creative application of the spell in.
<br/>It can be used to save yourself or allied heroes from spells with long delays, such as X Marks the Spot and Ghostship if timed correctly.<br/>In addition, you can save allied heroes from potentially lethal abilities such as Reaper's Scythe and Winter's Curse.<br/>Similarly, it can also be used to dodge projectiles. It is important to time it so that the projectiles connect while imprisoned, since the spell does not disjoint projectiles.<br/>Astral Imprisonment can be used on them to negate some of the damage from damage over time abilities, such as Poison Nova and Doom, which can potentially end up saving the ally. Against long lasting debuffs, it can be cast twice before the debuff expire.<br/> When misused and poorly timed, the application of Astral Imprisonment heavily backfire.
<br/>Just like how it can save allies from spells and damage, it can also do the same for your opponents, so communication with the team is important to prevent wasting of spells.<br/>It's entirely possible for you to cause a teammate's demise by casting Astral Imprisonment on them at the wrong time (such as when they have just begun to channel an escape ability).<br/>Casting Astral Imprisonment removes your opponent from the battlefield for 4 seconds. This buys you or your allies enough time to use Blink Dagger or a Town Portal Scroll to escape to safety.<br/>Astral Imprisonment is applied to all enemy heroes when they are hit by an Aghanim's Scepter's Sanity's Eclipse. As mentioned above, timing is key, as placing enemies in a state of Astral Imprisonment can heavily disrupt the flow of battle.<h4>Essence Aura</h4> Essence Aura is a great support aura for Heroes with low cooldown and low cost abilities that are used to harass their opponents (such as 's , 's  and 's ).
<br/>Essence Aura can be considered as the first skill to learn depending on your hero line-up, as early-game spell harassment can greatly deter your opponents and mess up their ability to last hit effectively.<br/>Essence Aura carried by illusions are fully active and will trigger the mana recovery aspect of the skill, allowing the illusions of Outworld Devourer to be of even greater support for the team by providing multiple areas of coverage.<br/>Early points in Essence Aura can be useful if you find yourself in need of mana, as it provides a respectable amount of 125 mana at level one, which is half of what an energy booster provides.<br/> As Essense Aura uses a pseudo-random distribution mechanic, Outworld Devourer needs 1000/1200/1400/1600 mana in order to not run dry of his mana pool.
<br/>Casting Arcane Orb on neutral or enemy creeps is a good way to recover lost mana as the pseudo-random distribution mechanic will eventually guarantee a proc by Essence Aura.<br/>Essence Aura does not proc on item abilities. Be wary of your mana consumption when using items such as Refresher Orb.<h4>Sanity's Eclipse</h4>This ability is best used as a finisher; after acquiring enough stolen intelligence in a teamfight or gank, Sanity's Eclipse can be used to snuff out any remaining enemy heroes, especially escaping invisible heroes like Riki, Clinkz and Bounty Hunter<br/>Keep in mind that heroes which gain intelligence at extremely high rates such as Silencer, Invoker and Pugna will often take minimal if not zero damage from this ability. As such, it's best to refrain from using this ability against these heroes unless you're significantly ahead in intelligence and certain it can finish them off.<br/>  is applied to all enemy heroes when they are hit by an 's Sanity Eclipse. As mentioned above, timing is key, as placing enemies in a state of Astral Imprisonment can heavily disrupt the flow of battle.
<br/>An Aghanim's Scepter's Sanity Eclipse can be used as a means to temporary remove all the enemy heroes from the field, giving your team time to regroup and follow up with other spells, or to retreat to safety.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Puck is an extremely elusive hero who misleads and disrupts enemies with a combination of disabling items and abilities. Though vulnerable, Puck is able to initiate on enemy teams, silencing and locking down opponents before teleporting away in a glowing orb. Puck's arsenal of tricks and items require sharp situational awareness during teamfights, and can be overwhelming to newer players. Nonetheless, a well-played Puck can escape nearly any situation, and return to repeatedly disable opponents for his teammates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very hard to pin down.<br/>Fairly mobile.<br/>Good lane ganker.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/>Slow turn rate.<br/>Requires multitasking.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Puck is almost always played in mid, but can also play a solo lane against multiple opponents due to his slippery nature.<br/>As a mid hero, Puck has easy access to Runes with Illusory Orb, and can gank the side lanes effectively with Dream Coil.<br/>With a Blink Dagger, Puck becomes a capable albeit fragile initiator.<br/>Puck deals significant magical nuke damage in the early game with Illusory Orb and Waning Rift.<br/>Puck's abilities, as well as his tendency to buy items with active abilities, makes him a busy multitasker in teamfights. Knowing when to use which ability/item is key to playing him well.<br/>A good initiation combo is as follows: Blink Dagger, then Waning Rift, then Dream Coil, then Illusory Orb through as many enemies as possible but in a safe direction, Phase Shift to remain safe, then Ethereal Jaunt to teleport to the Orb. The silence from Waning Rift is long enough to execute this combination.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Illusory Orb</h4>Use Illusory Orb in lane to harass opponents, or get a few extra last hits.<br/>After using Illusory Orb, move in the opposite direction to present enemies with a dilemma. This forces opponents to choose one direction, while Puck escapes by choosing whether or not to Ethereal Jaunt.<br/>If Puck uses Illusory Orb just before dying, he can buy back instantly and return to the fight with Ethereal Jaunt.<br/>Illusory Orb moves faster than Puck, and can be used when Puck needs to get somewhere quickly.<br/>Illusory Orb can function as Puck's iniation tool before he has a Blink Dagger.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Waning Rift</h4>When initiating, use Waning Rift immediately after jumping in with Blink Dagger so enemies cannot disable Puck before he uses Dream Coil.<br/>If Phase Shift is on cooldown, use Waning Rift to silence enemies, giving Puck's escape mechanisms more time to come off cooldown without being disabled.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Phase Shift</h4>During the early game, use Phase Shift to avoid tower attacks and harassment, including autoattacks.<br/>Using Phase Shift removes creep aggro. This allows Puck to freely harass with auto-attacks, then use Phase Shift to avoid taking damage from creeps.<br/>Use Phase Shift right after Illusory Orb to remain safe until the orb has travelled far enough to teleport to.<br/> Level 4 Phase Shift's duration is long enough to wait out 's 3 second cooldown, allowing Puck to escape from many dangerous situations. 
<br/>Keep in mind that Puck must still turn in the direction he is blinking towards. Puck's turn rate is among the lowest of all heroes.<br/>With fast enough reaction time, Phase Shift can be used to dodge an incoming iniation, allowing Puck to counter-initiate with Waning Rift and Dream Coil.<br/>More tips needed.<h4>Dream Coil</h4>Use Dream Coil to interrupt teleporting enemies.<br/>Dream Coil will catch enemies who are not in vision.<br/>Try to catch enemies at the edge of Dream Coil's cast radius, and this makes it more likely that they will break the bonds and be stunned.<br/>Dream Coil's relatively low cooldown means it can be used on high value single targets, such as an enemy hard carry.<br/>More tips needed.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Pugna is a utility caster whose spells give him strong nuking power and offer utility in various situations. He offers strong teamfight contribution and can push and counter-push very effectively with his nukes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High mobility<br/>Devastating nukes<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health pool<br/>Low armor<br/>Sloppy attack animation and attack speed.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Possessing the second-highest base movement speed in the game (tied with Luna) and a shorter-than-average cast animation, Pugna can be a very mobile hero who can get his spells off more easily than most other casters. However, his pitiful strength means that being caught by the enemy often means that he can be easily killed.<br/>Because of a combination of his squishiness and reliance on spell-casting, Pugna benefits most from building items that boost the size of his HP pool and provide him with mana regeneration. Because he has the highest intelligence growth in the game, Pugna's mana pool can support his spell casting relatively easily, so obtaining percentage-based mana regen can keep him from needing to return to base as often.<br/>Beware that despite his awesome nuking potential, Pugna does not have any hard disables, and thus enemies can easily escape him either by running away or channeling a Town Portal Scroll. In order to reliably nuke down and kill enemy heroes, Pugna must rely on allied disables, or purchase disable items himself.<br/>In general, Pugna requires farm and levels in order to be effective, however, he can also contribute to teamfights with levels alone.<br/>Pugna can be played as a solo mid-laner in order to bring out his potential. Regular use of Nether Blast allows Pugna to easily nuke down creep waves, as well as harass the enemy mid, and can also be used to quickly destroy the enemy tower if needed, giving Pugna's team an early advantage in gold and map control. Afterward, Pugna can transition into using Nether Blast to farm and push, and purchasing items to increase his effectiveness in teamfights.<br/>When not given farm priority, Pugna can be played as a side-lane support, using Nether Blast to harass and Decrepify as a setup disable, as well as using Nether Blast to push down towers early in a match. By stacking and pulling camps, Pugna can earn himself experience and gold to buy more support items for his team as needed, and level up his abilities to increase his teamfight contribution.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Nether Blast</h4>Nether Blast is a ground-targeted area nuke that, after a delay, deals magic damage within its radius.<br/>Due to its extremely low cooldown and the damage scaling, Nether Blast is a good ability to max out first as Pugna. It greatly increases Pugna's nuking potential, and can be used for pushing and farming.<br/>The long delay on Nether Blast makes it a hard spell to land on enemies who are watching Pugna's animations in an attempt to dodge the explosion. Try to fake them out with animation canceling if needed, as dispositioning the enemy can give Pugna more space for last-hitting or harass them out of range of last-hitting creeps.<br/>Remember that Nether Blast can damage buildings as well, which can allow Pugna to quickly destroy enemy towers if given the chance. Cast at the right time, it also greatly improves the chances of getting the last-hit on the tower if enemies are attempting to deny it or allied creeps are currently attacking it.<br/>Nether Blast has an extremely short cast range, but a wide radius, allowing Pugna to nuke targets up to 800 range away. Be very careful about using the spell to harass, as its short cast range may put Pugna in danger. Try to use the radius to your advantage and catch enemies as close to the far edge as possible, in order to keep as great a distance between them and Pugna.<br/>The key to efficient use of Nether Blast is to try to catch as many targets within its radius as possible. Try using it to last-hit creeps while at the same time nuking your lane opponent, or catching an enemy creep wave and tower at the same time during a push.<h4>Decrepify</h4>Decrepify inflicts its target, enemy or ally, with ethereal, slowing them while also reducing their magic resistance.<br/>Because all of Pugna's damage output is magical, Decrepify is a good ability to max out early on, as the magic resistance reduction can greatly improve his damage output. Leveling up the ability increases its disable and debuff potential, while reducing its turnaround time due to the greatly reduced cooldown.<br/>Casting Decrepify on enemies can act as a disable and debuff.<br/>Inflicting ethereal on an enemy will disarm them while slowing and reducing their magic resistance. This can be useful for stopping right-click carries in their tracks, and open them up to be hit with Nether Blast as well as other magic nukes.<br/>Be careful about when you cast Decrepify on enemies, as ethereal will also prevent allies from damaging them with physical attacks. Using the spell at the wrong time can inadvertently save the enemy, so judge the situation accordingly before committing the spell.<br/>As an allied-targeted spell, Decrepify can be used as a powerful defensive ability.<br/>Casting Decrepify on allies will slow them and reduce their magic resistance, but it will also render them immune to physical damage, which can save them from being killed by auto-attacks or physical damage spells.<br/>As with casting Decrepify on enemies, be sure to analyze the situation before committing Decrepify on allies. The magic resistance reduction can also be taken advantage of by the enemy, who can finish off your teammate with a high-powered nuke.<br/>Decrepify can be used as a powerful laning spell due to its extremely long cast range. Casting it on an enemy will prevent them from attacking, allowing Pugna to last-hit and deny low-health creeps without enemy interference. As well, using it as an initiating slow can allow allies to quickly move into position to land initiating nukes and disables with greater potency.<br/>When using Decrepify in combination with Nether Blast, try to take advantage of Decrepify's long cast range in order to cover for Nether Blast's delay. Target Nether Blast on an enemy, and then quickly cast Decrepify on them immediately afterward; the target will be slowed and unable to retreat outside of the range of Nether Blast, taking additional damage from the reduced magic resistance.<br/>In a pinch, Decrepify can be used as physical damage immunity while channeling spells or items. In particular, casting Decrepify prior to channeling a Town Portal Scroll can prevent enemies from finishing off a target (or Pugna himself) unless they have an interrupting disable.<br/>Decrepify can save allied heroes from early game rune clashes, where most of the damage output of all heroes is physical attacks.<h4>Nether Ward</h4>Nether Ward places a ward that degenerates enemy mana within a wide radius, and counters enemy spell usage if they expend mana within its range.<br/>Because Nether Ward is dependent on enemies expending mana, it is only useful in teamfights and as a counter-spell nuke during ganks. As teamfights do not happen until later in a match and ganks are situational, Nether Ward is a situational pickup in the early game and should be maxed out last.<br/>Nether Ward is a powerful teamfight and counter-gank ability that can greatly debilitate the enemy team if placed properly ahead of an engagement. Enemies attempting to cast spells and use items will deal tremendous damage to themselves based on the mana cost, and potentially kill themselves if the mana cost of their abilities is high enough.<br/>As Nether Ward fires its mana flares as magical damage, reducing the enemy's magic resistance through Decrepify can cause them to take increased damage from the flares.<br/>If time permits, placing Nether Ward during a gank can allow Pugna to deal nuke damage to punish enemies that attempt to land counter-disables or escape spells. Combined with Pugna's other nukes, this can often be enough to finish an enemy off before they can successfully escape.<br/>Because Nether Ward fires its flares before the enemy spell takes effect, it is possible to cancel the spell from happening if they die from the flare damage, making it a strong ability against spells like Laguna Blade, Freezing Field, Finger of Death and Mystic Flare.<br/>Keep in mind that Nether Ward has an extremely short cast range, so Pugna must move himself to the location where he wishes to place it. Try taking advantage of the ward's wide influence radius and place it behind your team or inside of a treeline where it will be hard to get to.<br/>Beware that even if the Nether Ward itself is hidden, the mana flares are visible to the enemy team, meaning that they can triangulate its position based on where the flares are coming from. Placing the ward behind Pugna's team can prevent them from easily destroying it even if they determine its location.<br/>The Nether Ward itself is a valid target for Decrepify, allowing Pugna to temporarily shield it from damage. This can be useful for extending its survivability for a few more seconds, and can allow Pugna to use the ward itself as bait to draw in enemies.<h4>Life Drain</h4>Life Drain is a channeled spell that causes Pugna to drain HP from a target enemy, replenishing his HP or mana. It can also be cast on allies to heal them using Pugna's HP pool.<br/>Life Drain can be a powerful nuking and survivability spell if Pugna can prevent the enemy from disabling him during the channeling. By healing himself while simultaneously damaging a target enemy, Pugna can quickly negate any damage that the enemy deals to him while also dealing heavy damage to an enemy and potentially scoring a kill.<br/>In general, try to get as close as possible to an enemy before casting Life Drain on them; unless they have a disable or silence, their only option for breaking the link is to run away.<br/>As with Pugna's other abilities, Life Drain is magical damage that can be augmented by reducing the enemy's magic resistance. Casting Decrepify on an enemy prior to Life Drain will greatly increase the amount of damage dealt (and in turn the amount healed).<br/>Life Drain can pierce spell immunity; however, the damage/heal is also directly dependent on the amount of damage dealt, so targeting a spell immune enemy will not deal any damage nor will it heal Pugna.<br/>Be careful about when and where you cast Life Drain. As the link breaks upon loss of vision on the target, enemies can escape by utilizing the Fog of War, either by juking around trees or simply walking far enough away at nighttime, and can use invisibility spells or items as well.<br/>With its low cooldown, Life Drain can be used tactically provided that Pugna has the mana to back it up. As Life Drain is not restricted to be cast on heroes only, Pugna can use the spell to replenish his HP by draining enemy or neutral creeps.<br/>If Pugna's HP is full, Life Drain will instead refill his mana when targeted on enemy heroes. However, mind that this cannot be used on enemy and neutral creeps, which can only restore Pugna's health.<br/>Life Drain destroys enemy illusions upon the first damage tick. When combined with Aghanim's Scepter, this allows Pugna to instantly remove enemy illusions from play, which can be useful in cases such as Haunt and Replicate/ Hybrid.<br/>When targeted on an ally, Life Drain allows Pugna to use his HP to restore their health. This can be useful in situations where Pugna needs to save a teammate, such as an allied carry who is being focused down. As an additional bonus, its ability to pierce spell immunity allows Pugna to heal them through an active Black King Bar.<br/>Functionally, An ally-targeted Life Drain acts as a reverse-cast ability with the target as the caster and Pugna as the target, though the channel is still focused on Pugna himself. This means that reducing Pugna's magic resistance (such as through a self-cast Decrepify) will increase the flow rate, while increasing Pugna's magic resistance will reduce the flow rate (or outright halt it in the case of 100% magic resistance through spell immunity or other abilities).<br/>Be mindful that the damage dealt to Pugna is lethal, and can cause him to commit suicide. In certain situations, this can be useful both to heal an ally and deny Pugna in the face of enemy attacks.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Queen of Pain is a fearsome mid laner who has impressive mobility through Blink, along with several spells that deal significant damage. Despite her sizeable amounts of damage, she is very fragile and weak to disables, and must be played smartly in order to succeed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great blink<br/>Can burst down foes quickly with her spells<br/>Two good AoE spells in Scream of Pain and Sonic Wave<br/>Her ultimate ignores Magic Resistance and Spell Immunity as it deals Pure damage<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low HP and Armor<br/>Is suddenly very vulnerable if she blinks in and fails to kill a target with her combo<br/>Sonic Wave can be dodged<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Queen of Pain is fairly straightforward to play as none of her damaging abilities require careful positioning or specific timings or combinations. Instead, like Anti-Mage, Queen of Pain starts to shine through proper Blink usage and good itemization, allowing her to farm with great efficiency and be a threat all over the map. Blink also allows her to jump in and out of fights for some potentially cheeky plays at low hp.<br/>Her generic combo would be to blink in on a target and immediately use Scream of Pain as it has no cast time, slow him down with a Shadow Strike to help land your Sonic Wave. Follow with right clicks and an extra blink + scream to finish him off.... But you will usually have a couple of items you will need to add to the equation.<br/>QoP is superb at chasing her prey, but is very delicate and is often in more danger from enemy towers than enemy heroes. Gearing for HP regeneration may be advisable, as in a critical situation you can Blink to an inaccessible place and wait to recuperate. Bottle will also help with this.<br/> If being chased (a common situation for QoP), an often-useful tactic is to blink behind the enemies pursuing you. They will typically assume you blinked ahead and continue on in that direction, allowing for an escape.
<br/>A more cautious strategy is to run in without using Blink, saving it for a potential escape. This may be necessary against high-damage enemy heroes, as QoP is very frail and in encounters should try to avoid being attacked at all.<br/>In a late-game encounter, QoP is best used by hiding until such time as the enemies' more powerful spells are on cooldown, allowing her to Blink in and inflict huge damage on multiple enemies owing to her AoE capabilities without putting her at risk of being killed by powerful spells.<br/>Similarly to Lina, QoP has very high burst damage capabilities, but is delicate and not suited to long encounters because of her spells' high mana costs. This can be remedied with items such as Bloodstone and Linken's Sphere, as well as Aghanim's Scepter to reduce Sonic Wave's cooldown.<br/>Be aware that Rupture will be calculated against the distance traversed should you Blink shorter than the max distance. You can avoid the damage by blinking max distance (1300 units) and moving immediately in that direction.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shadow Strike</h4> Shadow Strike has a very long duration, with the slow effect lasting for 15 seconds. Coupled with its incredible short cooldown, Queen of Pain is capable of keeping an enemy slowed indefinitely or slowing multiple heroes in quick succession.
<br/>The slow effect diminishes with every passing second. Against Heroes with naturally high movement speed like Luna or Enchantress , you will need to constantly cast the spell to refresh the slow effect.<br/> The bulk of Shadow Strike's damage is dealt over time in intervals of 3 seconds. Heroes with high health regeneration and/or magic resistance can easily to shrug off the damage during its course.
<br/>Enemy Heroes that are under the effects of Shadow Strike and are below 25% health are capable of being denied by their allies, and as such, it is not a reliable spell in securing a kill.<br/> Shadow Strike has a relatively short cast range, making it difficult to land the spell on opposing ranged Heroes without incurring damage herself. Consider the risk and mana consumption when engaging them.
<br/>Against a melee opponent, it is a very powerful harassing skill. it may be worthwhile to maximise this skill if the opponent's lineup consist of entirely melee Heroes.<br/>Due to the long cast animation, as well as the slow traveling speed of the projectile, opponents with quick fingers can easily disjoint the spell.<h4>Blink</h4>Blink is able to disjoint projectiles and spells.<br/>Queen of Pain will always face in the direction that she is Blinking towards. Keen opponents will be able to use that knowledge to their advantage and predict where she may land.<br/>Though Blink has a short cooldown of 6 seconds, a reckless cast can leave Queen of Pain in a dire situation.<h4>Scream of Pain</h4> Despite the visual projectile, Scream of Pain cannot be disjointed.
<br/>It will also affect invisible units and units in the Fog of War.<br/>Scream of Pain has a deceptively large radius of 475 units, making it viable as an initiating spell.<h4>Sonic Wave</h4> Sonic Wave deals Pure damage and bypasses the spell immunity granted by .
<br/>Since Sonic Wave deals Pure damage, the only ways of increasing its damage is though Intelligence items and Aether Lens.<br/>Sonic Wave is one of the few spells that can affect Animal Courier and Flying Courier.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Rubick is a flexible spellcaster, best known for his ability to copy enemies last used spells to use against them. He is commonly picked as a counter to big teamfight spells such as Tidehunter's Ravage, Enigma's Black Hole and Earthshaker Echo Slam.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Instant cast time for stolen spells<br/>High mana capacity.<br/>Reliable Stun and Nuke that works very well in early-mid game.<br/>High Magic Resistance.<br/>Not item-dependent.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health pool<br/>Lack of damage<br/>Rubick's strength and effectiveness depends on Enemy's team picks.<br/>One of the hardest heroes to play in this game.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3> Despite possessing attributes typical of the archetypal support caster, the possession of Spell Steal allows Rubick to be built differently. While he only has one innate disable, he should generally be built with mobility and casting in mind, with items that help with initiation taking priority due to the utility that Spell Steal provides.
<br/>Despite his high base intelligence, Rubick suffers from mediocre intelligence growth, and his spells have relatively flat mana costs; additionally, consistent use of Spell Steal will further tax his mana pool due to the need to support not only his innate spells, but also any stolen abilities, particularly mana-expensive ultimates. The flat mana cost for his abilities means that they cost a larger fraction of his mana pool in the early game, and thus limits his operational time in the field. Items that grant Rubick a larger mana pool and increased mana regeneration are very helpful for keeping him in the game.<br/>Although a great disabler and potential initiator with the right items and stolen spells, Rubick is still very frail and can be easily killed if caught out of position by the enemy team. Rubick should focus on building items that grant him more mobility rather than increasing the size of his HP pool, as increased mobility can help with both initiation and escape rather than simply delay his death in the face of enemy attacks.<br/>During the mid- and late-game, stealing key teamfight spells and keeping yourself alive should be your main goals. Spell Steal only has a 0.1 second cast time and high cast range, so quick fingers and fast reaction time will give your team a huge advantage.<br/> Rubick is a very flexible caster who can be played as a support, roamer or core farmer. The role that he is selected for will largely change his how much farm he gets, and in turn how effective he can be with his abilities. However, his skill and item build remains largely the same.
<br/>As a support, Rubick generally performs lane harassment and creep pulling duties, getting low farming and experience priority. Telekinesis allows him to catch the enemy off-laner and pull them back, as well as making chain-disables by his tri-lane easier to execute due to Telekinesis's ability to reposition the enemy precisely.<br/>As a roamer, Rubick aims to disable and disposition enemies with Telekinesis, setting up kills for his lanes to give them an early advantage. A roaming Rubick prioritizes in mobility, disable and nuking.<br/>As a core, Rubick goes to the mid lane, using Fade Bolt to nuke and harass, and Telekinesis to set up kills if his supports and roamers rotate to mid for a gank. Due to being given farm and experience priority, mid Rubick's goal is to get level 6 as fast as possible and use his gold and level advantage to start moving around the map for ganks and kills. Gold should be spent on mobility items, particularly a fast Blink Dagger, and utility and disable items to turn teamfights to his team's advantage.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Telekinesis</h4>Telekinesis stuns its target for a short duration, and allows Rubick to displace them with its Telekinesis Land sub-ability, stunning any enemies in the impact radius.<br/>Telekinesis is a short disable, but can be extremely powerful as it can displace the enemy upon landing, putting them in a very disadvantageous position.<br/>No matter what role Rubick is played in, at least one point should be spent on this ability in the laning stage. Because leveling it up increases its disable duration (both lift and stun on secondary targets) and cast range, this ability benefits from being maxed out early in a match in order to increase Rubick's disable potential.<br/>Rubick is a very strong supporting disabler when placed in a side lane, since Telekinesis can disable a target for a disproportionate amount of time (lift time, as well as displacement upon landing). This allows him to greatly magnify the effects of chain disables by his team as he can prevent a target from dodging area-of-effect stuns and increase the length of their retreat path.<br/>When using Telekinesis alongside allies with unreliable disables, always make sure to communicate your intentions beforehand. Telling your teammates that you will not displace the enemy with Telekinesis Land, or that you will always pull them backwards, will give them forewarning as to where to cast their stun. Not communicating can cause allies to miss their stun completely, resulting in a failed gank.<br/>Remember that any enemies within a certain radius of a lifted target will be stunned upon the target landing. Telekinesis Land allows Rubick to select the area that the target will land in, allowing him to utilize the secondary stun as needed. This can be extremely powerful when counter-initiating during enemy ganks, as Rubick can immediately disable one attacker with the lift, and then stun any other enemy heroes with the land.<br/>When choosing a location for Telekinesis Land, it is possible to place the target on a different elevation than their lift point. You can use this to your advantage by placing the target over a ridge, forcing them to take the long way around, which can be useful for extending a fleeing enemy's escape path or preventing a chasing enemy from easily pursuing. As well, targets can be placed on the elevated cliffs near the rune spots, trapping them in place for an easy kill.<h4>Fade Bolt</h4>Fade Bolt is a bouncing nuke that deals a respectable amount of damage to enemies while also reducing the damage their physical attacks deal.<br/>Due to its nuking power and attack damage reduction on targets, Fade Bolt can be a surprisingly effective counter-gank spell, as it will both deal damage to the enemy and reduce their attack damage, decreasing their chances of securing a kill with their attacks as well as their chances of surviving and escaping after the gank. It can be a useful spell to break up or at least hinder enemy gank attempts.<br/>Fade Bolt can be a powerful harassing tool during laning, as not only does it deal damage but reduces the enemy's attack damage. However, mind its mana cost, and remember that casting it will push your lane both due to the nuke damage on nearby creeps and the reduced damage that the creeps will deal. Avoid spamming it unless you have a source of mana replenishment, as you may need your mana to cast Telekinesis instead.<br/>With a Soul Ring; you can spam a level 4 Fade Bolt free of cost (150 mana) every 30 seconds, provided you have the heath regeneration to back it up.<br/>Remember that Fade Bolt deals the greatest damage to the first target struck, and decreases in strength as it bounces to other enemies. Keep this in mind if trying to cast this spell to finish off an enemy, as the bounces may cause it to weaken to the point where it cannot guarantee a kill. If possible, try to directly target the enemy you are trying to kill in order to maximize the amount of damage they take.<br/>Conversely, Fade Bolt's range can be augmented by using the bounce to hit an enemy at range. If a weakened enemy is out of range from being directly targeted, they can still possibly be finished off by a bounce as long as they are not already in the fog of war, and there are other units nearby that can be used as a relay.<br/>Due to its nuking and pushing power, Fade Bolt is a useful tool for a mid-lane Rubick, as the damage can harass the enemy mid while reducing their last-hitting power. As well, pushing the creep wave into the enemy tower can keep them occupied when the runes spawn, and force them to last-hit against their tower, possibly reducing the amount of gold they get.<h4>Null Field</h4>Null Field is a survivability aura that grants Rubick and all nearby allies increased magic resistance.<br/>Null Field generally should not be picked up during the laning stage, as it does not scale well and reduces the damage of already weak magic nukes by small amounts. However, it should still be maxed out by level 14 as it can greatly improve teammates' survivability against magic nukes, particularly as it stacks alongside all other sources of magic resistance.<br/>Keep in mind that Null Field affects allied creeps, not just heroes. If pushing alongside creep waves, Rubick can increase the survivability of his lane against enemy magic nukes, forcing them to expend more effort to halt pushes. However, beware that the enemy can simply choose to jump on Rubick instead, so try to stay a respectable distance behind, and make sure that there are nearby teammates to back you up.<h4>Spell Steal</h4>Spell Steal is one of the most powerful spells in the game, as used properly it can turn teamfights around completely. However, its use requires impeccable positioning, timing and judgment to ensure that the right spell is stolen and used at the right time. Keep in mind what abilities your enemies have, which of those you plan to steal, and in what situations the enemy will use those spells, so that you can be ready when an opportunity presents itself.<br/>Spell Steal is one of the hardest spells in the game to use properly, as it requires extensive game knowledge to understand every aspect of the spells you are able to steal. As well, its long cooldown without Aghanim's Scepter means that there is no room for error if you intend on stealing a specific spell during a fight rather than taking what comes. In general, more experience playing as other heroes in the game translates to better understanding of how to best utilize Spell Steal, as you will understand all the aspects of the spells you are potentially stealing, as well as when enemies will cast those spells.<br/>Virtually all spells stolen by Rubick will retain his 0.1 second cast animation. This means that spells such as Fissure, Ice Path and Split Earth will cast almost immediately. Any spell that requires channel time or extended casting animations such as Assassinate and Epicenter will still have extended durations.<br/>Certain spells can be extremely powerful against the heroes that they are stolen from. For instance, if there is a Bounty Hunter on the enemy team, stealing Track from him allows Rubick to completely negate his Shadow Walk, as well as drastically increase Rubick's gold gain. Stealing Mystic Flare from Skywrath Mage can allow Rubick to destroy him in place by disabling him with Telekinesis, and so on.<br/>Stolen spells can often fill in any deficiencies that Rubick has, allowing him to diversify greatly. For instance, stealing an area-of-effect magic nuke can allow Rubick to farm more easily as he can combine it with Fade Bolt, stealing a stun can allow him to double up disable duration when combined with Telekinesis, and so on.<br/>Keep in mind that when chain-disabling with a stolen spell, you can steal another one immediately afterward if Spell Steal is off cooldown. For instance, ganking with a stolen Storm Hammer can stun an enemy for up to 4.25 seconds when combined with Telekinesis, but if the gank target has just used a stun (such as a Wraith King with Wraithfire Blast), Rubick can steal that and add it at the end, stunning the target for a maximum of 6.25 seconds.<br/>While a stolen spell can be powerful by itself even factoring in the reduced cast times, Rubick's true strength comes from combining those spells with his innate ones. For instance, stealing Shackleshot can be extremely powerful as Rubick can lift a target at will and drop them next to a tree, stealing Enfeeble can drastically neuter a target's attack power when stacked with Fade Bolt, and so on.<br/>Don't forget that stolen spells can synergize with allies' abilities as well, not only those of Rubick. If the enemy has a spell that can synergize well with that of a teammate, it can be very beneficial to attempt to steal that spell in tandem with an ally. For instance, if there is a Dark Seer on the opposing team and Disruptor on yours, stealing the Dark Seer's Vacuum can allow your Disruptor to get off a perfect Kinetic Field + Static Storm combo.<br/>Remember that stolen spells have a memory duration based on the level of your ultimate, so you should keep in mind how you can best use that spell before you forget it. If you have stolen a powerful teamfight ultimate, it can be wise to try to force the enemy into a teamfight that is disadvantageous for them. If you have stolen a strong area of effect nuke, you can use it to farm during downtime or push out lanes. If you have stolen a strong stun, you should attempt to find a target to gank as you can greatly extend the duration of your disable by combining the stolen disable with Telekinesis.<br/>It can be a good habit to mark the time at which you stole a spell via team notifications; Alt + click the spell you have stolen, then the clock to indicate when you stole it. As the buff duration for Spell Steal can be difficult to read, logging the time at which you stole a certain spell can let you know approximately when it will expire.<br/>Aghanim's Scepter not only reduces Spell Steal's cooldown to 2 seconds and increases its cast range, it also (in most cases) grants Rubick the upgrade benefits of any spells he has stolen, regardless of whether the original caster has an Aghanim's Scepter or not. Therefore, a stolen Black Hole will apply Enigma's current level of Midnight Pulse to the area, a stolen Heat-Seeking Missile will fire up to 4 rockets, and so on.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Demon is an excellent defensive support capable of resetting fights, counter-initiating, and dealing with blinks and magic-immunity. His Disruption working well as a way to break up chain stuns as well as set up an ally's stun, debuffing the enemy with Soul Catcher is a 50% damage increase, while his ultimate Demonic Purge slows and dispels enemies even through magic immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Magic immunity piercing debuffs<br/>Chain stun breaker<br/>Excellent gank setup<br/>Wave clear and tower push with Shadow Poison and Disruption illusions<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No hard crowd control<br/>Offers little sustain in and after fights<br/>Nuke requires time to build up damage<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>In most scenarios, Shadow Demon's combo goes like this: Initiate on a lonesome enemy with Disruption; use Shadow Poison to disable their Blink Dagger should they have one, use Soul Catcher on top of it to amplify the damage taken, use Demonic Purge when the enemy pops out of Disruption, and attempt stacking more poison on them during the slow period. The combo can be repeated if you have Aghanim's Scepter.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Disruption</h4>Disruption has many good uses. One way is to save an ally after they get caught (e.g. by a stun) and save them from damage they would otherwise take, as well as prevent the enemy from stacking disables. Another use is to set up a gank: use Disruption, and then your allies can position themselves closer to the target, as well as set up spells that require aiming, or has a delay.<br/>Disruption, as most banishes, is a very versatile skill, that has this unfortunate flaw it can do more harm than good to your team than good, in the wrong hands.<br/>Like Eul's Scepter of Divinity, it is a perfect setup for unreliable stuns such as Leshrac's Split Earth, Lina's Light Strike Array or Kunkka's Torrent. Like Eul's, it is perfect to waste 2.5 seconds of an opponent's precious buff, such as Dazzle's Shallow Grave or Abaddon's Borrowed Time.<br/>Unlike Eul's, it won't purge an enemy of a long-lasting buff like Empower or Bloodlust... But you have Demonic Purge for that.<br/>Unlike Eul's, it can be used on allies to save them from opponents' initiation or even their finishing blow. Thus you can save an ally and turn a fight around by banishing him from a predictable Reaper's Scythe or even a Finger of Death or a Laguna Blade. The same can be said for Outworld Devourer's Astral Imprisonment.<br/>In return, however, and for the same reasons, it can also serve as the perfect initiation tool for the enemy team!<br/>Disruption also creates two very strong illusions of the target, making Shadow Demon very dangerous against illusion based heroes such as Terrorblade and Phantom Lancer. If the target is an enemy, the illusions will automatically attack it. These same heroes will also work as your best partners when besieging the opponent's high ground at little to no risk. Special mention goes to Centaur Warrunner whose illusions benefit from his Return passive, damaging the towers for a considerable amount should they (automatically) target the illusions.<br/>Plenty of heroes have an escape mechanism that can render your illusions useless after the disruption ( Blink, Leap, Pounce...), if no ally on your team has any follow up stun or silence, you may be better off leaving it at that instead of wasting your mana on extra spells. But you can also control the illusions to target a different opponent, or even push out the lane and farm. In the early game, the illusions spawned can also serve to fully block an opponent that would be trying to hide or juke in the trees, or that would be carelessly walking close to a wall. Hypothetically, you should even be able to fully block an opponent by your lonesome self with just the help of an Iron Branch: the enemy would be blocked between yourself, two illusions and a temporary tree. You cannot block someone with only yourself plus the illusions and no extra border.<br/>If you are facing a hero with a strong orb effect like Anti-Mage in the lane, use Disruption on them often and force them to flee from the illusions.<br/>Disruption can be used to help teammates land spells with long cast times or delays. Examples include skills such as Torrent, Sacred Arrow, Light Strike Array and even Sun Strike or Slithereen Crush. When combined with Soul Catcher, this makes for a powerful ganking combination.<br/>Check illusions of enemies created by Disruption. You can get useful information such as their skill build and item build.<br/>Finally, the illusions can be very useful for heroes that tend to build a lot of auras, most notably a radiance, since your illusions will benefit from it, turning the enemy's radiance against them.<h4>Soul Catcher</h4>Soul Catcher is extremely strong skill at all stages of the game, and arguably Shadow demon's only skill that scales well into the late game. However, its search radius is fairly large and if you use it in the middle of a creep wave, odds are it won't hit your intended target.<br/>Though it's tempting to always use it after disruption as part of your general combo, always use it by itself when you have any kind of opportunity as it tremendously increases your and your team's damage output and the duration lasts as long as the cooldown anyway.<br/>Soul Catcher synergizes extremely well with single-target nukes, such as Finger of Death, Laguna Blade, or Dagon.<br/>Soul Catcher is extremely effective in conjunction with Pure damage spells since they ignore any kind of magic armor and are amplified.<h4>Shadow Poison</h4>Shadow Poison is Shadow Demon's only directly damage spell outside of his ultimate and has the potential to deal 1040 damage before reductions when maxed although it does take some time to set up. Shadow poison is at its strongest in drawn out fights where Shadow Demon can stand in the backlines debilitating his foes with his spells and spam it out. Unlike the rest of his spells Shadow Poison IS DISPELLABLE, however, it always deals its damage when the debuff is removed, no matter how. Shadow poison will always disable Blink Dagger on hit and can do so against enemies in Disruption because of this it is especially good at keeping blink heroes from countering your initiation or push such as Sand King, Earthshaker, or Tidehunter. Shadow Poison gives flying vision over its area during travel time and can be used to deward up cliffs and scout out jukes and ganks.<br/>Shadow Poison becomes much more lethal when stacked up to 5, with this, you can destroy enemy heroes in the lane, even in the earliest stages. However, the mana cost is great and you should learn to control your mana or buy mana-boosting items for you to perform.<br/>Be wary if your opponent has a Magic Stick or Magic Wand, as the charges provided by poison will help him sustain in lane and potentially turn a gank around, and poison is very easy to dodge if you keep an eye on shadow demon. However, also remember that an opponent needs vision of you as you're casting the spell to get the charge, and it's well worth a stick charge to cancel a Clarity or Healing Salve as you can do so from a safe distance.<br/>Shadow Poison fully works on invisible heroes, and it can be your safest way to secure a kill without diving a tower. Since the damage doubles on each stack of poison, it's only interesting to keep the stacks on a fleeing opponent (that could potentially heal while you try to chase) if you think you can get at least 3 stacks on him. If you can only get two, it will damage for the same amount as two stacks of one. In lane however, you have a full ten seconds between each stack to try to add them up to 4 or 5, forcing him to run away. If the opponent is melee and tries to go for a last hit, there is your opportunity to add another stack on him.<br/>Though an opponent needs to be extra careless to allow 4-5 stacks of poison to stack up on him, the same can't be said for creeps. In a passive game, you can easily farm the jungle with poison, speeding up the process as you level it. It's also a reliable tool to double or even triple stack certain camps (and farm those stacks too): the poison will activate by itself after ten seconds so you can use it once on a far away camp around :43 so it will aggro you at :53 and stack; use another on a nearby camp that you don't have vision of at :53; and stack the one in front of you with a right click at :55. You can't be too far away from the first camp you're trying to stack or else it will not aggro you when the poison activates, making the whole triple-stack process rather tricky.<br/>Similarly, should you find a bit of space to farm in lane, poison will help you stay behind/safer and farm/push out the lane faster<h4>Demonic Purge</h4>Demonic Purge is an extremely strong magic immunity piercing skill that is most effective versus heroes that want to be in the midst of a fight with magic immunity such as Luna, Sven, Lifestealer or Ursa. In addition to the potent slow, Demonic Purge will live up to its name and remove any friendly buffs placed on the target such as Warcry, Bloodlust, Repel, Guardian Angel, Surge and a variety of item buffs such as Mask of Madness, Satanic, and Ghost Scepter. Aghanim's Scepter grants an enormous increase in potency by giving Shadow Demon a potentially 15 second magic immunity piercing slow and dispel. Aghanim's Scepter also gives Demonic Purge the Break debuff which disables enemy passives for the duration of the spell.<br/>A Diffusal Blade can be used for much the same purposes as Demonic Purge, while having up to 16 charges (After using all the charges and buying a new recipe, and excluding any Diffusal Blades you might obtain in the future exhausting all charges possible). However, it does not go through Black King Bar (Or other similar time-based spell immunity, such as Rage) and it does not apply a Break. Consider it a possible alternative if Aghanim's Scepter is too costly and/or you need to purge multiple targets at once, but wish to save your ultimate for the one with the highest priority.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Shaman is a very powerful ganker and pusher, who possesses very strong disables and nukes. His spells allow him to disable lone enemies for extended periods of time, making them easy prey for his teammates, or to make short work of creep waves and towers.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong early game nukes<br/>Long duration disables<br/>Works well with almost any hero<br/>Can splitpush lanes and take towers quickly<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very mana dependent<br/>No escape mechanism<br/>Low mobility<br/>More item and level dependent than other supports<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>Because of his strong disables and powerful nukes, Shadow Shaman benefits greatly from building intelligence items that extend the size of his mana pool and provide mana regen, as well as mobility items to allow him to get close enough to cast his disables and nukes on enemies. The additional mobility also aids in survivability by allowing him to re-position himself to escape enemy attempts to kill him.<br/>Because Shadow Shaman's disables are all unit-targeted, they can reliably disable enemies if he gets close enough to them. However, this also means that they can be easily negated by Linken's Sphere or even reflected with Lotus Orb, so be sure to check the enemy's inventory prior to committing expensive disables.<br/> Rhasta can be played as either a support or a core. His farm priority mainly dictates how effective he can be in either role, with small differences in how he is played.
<br/>As a support, Shadow Shaman should focus on babysitting his team's safe lane carry, and setting up kills with his disables when rotating for ganks. As he has two hard disables, getting close enough to a lone enemy can often ensure a kill if his teammates have enough damage output.<br/>In general, if Shadow Shaman is played as a core, he is played as a solo mid where he can get fast levels to make use of his spells early on. A mid Shadow Shaman should focus on maxing out Ether Shock to farm and harass, push out the lane to clear the way to grabbing a rune, and attempt to get kills on the enemy mid once he is level 6.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Ether Shock</h4>Ether Shock is a powerful damage nuke that must be unit targeted, hitting nearby enemy units according to its level.<br/>Ether Shock is very inefficient at level 1, only hitting a single target, so it is most profitably cast only when it is level 3 or higher. Depending on how Shadow Shaman is played, it should either be maxed first for the nuke damage, or ignored in favor of maxing out his disables.<br/>The high damage and low cooldown on Ether Shock allows Shadow Shaman to make quick work of creep waves and neutral camps. Given a steady source of mana regen, Shadow Shaman can flash-farm with the spell while simultaneously pushing or counter-pushing lanes, threatening the enemy's towers and taking away map control.<br/>When casting Ether Shock to nuke creep waves, remember that it can hit enemies at twice the cast range and the area is largest at the far end. Try to target the spell on the middle of an enemy creep wave, and position Shadow Shaman in such a way as to concentrate as many creeps on the far end as possible.<h4>Hex</h4>Hex disables the target enemy instantly, inflicting a silence and mute while drastically cutting down their movement speed.<br/>Hex is a potent disable since it will instantly hard-disable its target and eliminates their ability to cast spells or use items. In general at least one early level should be taken, but other levels may be forgone in favor of other abilities depending on the build.<br/>Hex should always be the spell that Shadow Shaman uses to initiate a gank, as its instant cast time prevents the target from reacting. Following disables can be targeted on the enemy at leisure in order to secure a kill.<br/>Unlike other hex-type abilities, Shadow Shaman's Hex reduces the target's base movement speed down to 100, rather than 140. This makes the enemy slightly easier to hit with unreliable follow-up disables such as Split Earth or Torrent.<h4>Shackles</h4>Shackles is a powerful channeled disable that can stun its target for up to 5 seconds.<br/>As with Hex, at least one early level of Shackles should be taken to maximize Shadow Shaman's disable potential. A single point in the ability allows Shadow Shaman to disable an enemy for almost 3 seconds while dealing nuke damage.<br/>While Shackles has a lower cast range than Hex and requires channeling, it also stuns its target for the duration of the channel, preventing it from moving. The longer disable duration also allows teammates to otherwise utilize powerful follow-up disables and nukes, such as Stasis Trap and Ghostship, which might otherwise be dodged.<br/>Priority between Hex and Shackles should depend on team composition, however Shackles is generally the better disable to max out first as its mana cost scales better and it can deal damage for the duration of the channel. If your teammates have reliable damage output, holding the target in place for up to 5 seconds can allow them to deal large amounts of damage. However, keep in mind that unlike Hex, Shackles can be interrupted by silencing or stunning Shadow Shaman, so it is not as useful if there is a nearby enemy who can interrupt you.<br/>Shackles deals its damage in a large number of small instances. This makes it a very strong ability for instantly shredding protective abilities like Refraction and Living Armor.<br/>When possible, try to take advantage of Shackles' extremely short cooldown. If it is cast as an initiating disable, its channeling time will allow half of its cooldown duration to pass, and a follow-up Hex can hard-disable the target for an additional 3.5 seconds, leaving the enemy free for only 1.5 seconds before Shackles comes off cooldown.<br/>Because it is a channeled spell, shift-queuing other disables during Shackles can allow them to be instantly cast once the channel duration ends. This can be useful for denying the enemy any openings in disable duration to take advantage of.<h4>Mass Serpent Ward</h4>Mass Serpent Ward summons ten snake wards that deal piercing damage to their targets.<br/>Serpent wards can make short work of incoming creep waves and deal tremendous amounts of damage to enemy towers over their long duration. Placing the wards on top of a tower that is being pushed can make quick work of it so long as the enemy is unable to attack and destroy them.<br/>Rhasta's Mass Serpent Wards can be commanded. Beginners often neglect to control them, but even if Rhasta is dead he can have a big impact on a fight with intelligent use of his wards.<br/>Beware that while Mass Serpent Wards can deal large amounts of damage, they are also very easy to destroy with attacks, so be careful about when and where they are placed. Enemies that can isolate the wards can make quick work of them, wasting the spell and feeding gold to the enemy team.<br/>One of the most important features of Mass Serpent Ward is the box figure they are placed in. This allows Shadow Shaman to place the wards right on top of an enemy hero, trapping them in place if they do not have any mobility spells or items to displace themselves.<br/>In a pinch, Mass Serpent Wards can be used to defend against pushes. Their striking power allows them to quickly kill creeps that are trying to approach the tower, and discourage the enemy from pushing.<br/>The splash damage dealt by Mass Serpent Wards is registered as magical damage. Against clumped up enemies, it can be beneficial to try to hit adjacent targets in order to deal magical splash damage to the primary target, as direct serpent ward attacks deal minimal damage to heroes with lots of armor.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Silencer is an intelligence-based teamfight-oriented hero that scales exceptionally well thanks to his innate ability Intelligence Steal. He is able to render any magic user useless with his Last Word and Arcane Curse. His signature ultimate, Global Silence can make a swift table turns in teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can steal 2 intelligence for every hero he killed or die nearby him.<br/>Can be played either as a support or as a carry.<br/>Can harass enemies in the lane effectively.<br/>Deals pure damage with Glaives of Wisdom.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no real "instant" silence besides his ultimate.<br/>Has no escape abilities and is easy to gank.<br/>Weakness against Black King Bar limits his effectiveness as a carry.<br/>Is less effective if he didn't have a good early game and didn't steal enough intelligence.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Silencer can be played as a carry or support. As a carry, he focuses on taking fights and getting kills and assists with his spells, dealing tremendous damage with his auto-attacks while using his spells to prevent the enemy from easily retaliating. As a support, he focuses on harassing the enemy with his spells and building support-utility items while reserving his ultimate for major teamfights.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arcane Curse</h4>Arcane Curse is a decent harass spell as it costs little mana to use and can either prevent enemies from casting spells for a while and deal some damage, or force the enemy to take much more damage if they dare to cast spells during it. Its area-of-effect nature and high cast range allow Silencer to apply the debuff to multiple enemy heroes at once, or cast it from a safe range by edging the enemy with the far end of the effect radius.<br/>The spell has a pseudo-silence-like effect on enemies; Although enemies are free to cast spells, they take a penalty for doing so, taking more and more damage from the curse for each cast they do.<br/>In teamfights, harassing the enemy with Arcane Curse before the engagement can severely change the outcome of a battle, depending on what the hit enemies decide to do: Either they hesitate to cast spells in order to prevent its duration from stacking up, or they decide to cast spells and therefore take much more damage and possibly die to the long duration of the curse they stack up. This is especially effective against heroes who heavily spam their abilities in fights, like Bristleback or Batrider, dealing either tons of damage to them, or rendering them useless in a fight for several seconds.<br/>Try to cast Arcane Curse on enemies before they cast their spells when laning. This ensures that they take much more damage from the spell or possible prevent them from farming if they use spells to do it. In some cases, it is even possible to apply the curse on enemies during their cast times, but this only works against abilities with a long cast time (e.g. Fissure) and requires quick reaction from the player.<br/>The slow from Arcane Curse can place the enemy in a disadvantageous position as they are unable to easily chase or escape without taking more damage. Choosing to not cast a spell prevents them from decisively nuking or disabling.. This can cause enemies to reconsider their options, as choosing to continue engaging the enemy can lead to them being slowed and taking damage for longer, while choosing to disengage removes them from play anyways as they cannot re-engage easily because of the slow.<br/>The slow can hinder melee carries who depend on movement speed in order to prevent themselves from being kited.<h4>Glaives of Wisdom</h4> Glaives of Wisdom is what allows Silencer to become a powerful right-click carry, normally something that intelligence heroes cannot do. As its Pure damage scales with Silencer's intelligence, he can inflict large amounts of damage with his auto-attacks by building up enough intelligence, whether through farming items or via Intelligence Steal.
<br/>In the laning stage, it may be beneficial to get one early level of Glaives of Wisdom, as Silencer can deal around 8-10 bonus Pure damage with an attack, useful for last-hitting as a carry. As well, the attack modifier can be manually cast to harass the enemy without drawing creep aggro, whether as a support or carry.<h4>Last Word</h4>Last Word curses Silencer's target to be faced with unfortunate consequences. If they cast a spell during the debuff duration, they are immediately silenced and take damage, useful for breaking the spell combo of enemies like Tiny and Tinker.<br/>Last Word's silence proc follows the same rule as Arcane Curse, and only procs on spells requiring mana or which are not toggle-able.<br/>In general, Last Word is used best against spell casters, as they suffer the most from the silence. Physical attack carries do not often have to cast numerous spells, however<br/>Last Word is a powerful harassing spell in-lane, as it can force the enemy to retreat from the lane even if they do not cast a spell. If the enemy does not retreat, they are silenced near the creep wave, allowing them to be chased down and killed.<br/>Remember that Last Word has a very long cast range, and thus can be targeted on fleeing enemy heroes. If you manage to cast it on an enemy who is already very low on health, you can secure the kill as he will most likely die to the damage at the end of the delay, proccing Intelligence Steal at the same time.<br/>Last Word can be highly effective against heroes with two-spell combos or single spells with two parts, as they are only able to cast the first part of their combo but not the second due to the silence. This is particularly effective against combos such as Tiny's Avalanche-Toss, Keeper of the Light's Illuminate, Elder Titan's Astral Spirit into Echo Stomp, Phoenix' Icarus Dive, and so on.<h4>Global Silence</h4>Global Silence is a powerful initiating and counter-initiating spell that can be cast no matter where Silencer is. However, keep in mind the spell's long cooldown, as using it ineffectively gives the enemy a window of opportunity where they can engage your team in the knowledge that you do not have your ultimate.<br/>Global Silence can apply its debuff through spell immunity and invulnerability. This means that it is able to silence enemies even after they activate a Black King Bar, and even through spells like Ball Lightning. However, it is also a purgeable debuff, meaning that activating Black King Bar or Manta Style after being afflicted with Global Silence removes it. As such, it is important to time your use of the ultimate wisely.<br/>Silencer on his own is not an initiator; if you try to initiate with Global Silence alone, the enemy team can simply disengage and wait out the silence. However, Global Silence can synergize extremely well with almost any initiator. When someone on your team initiates (or immediately before), activate Global Silence. The other team will be helpless as you collapse on them.<br/>Silencer's spells can combo in many useful ways.<br/>Last Word can be applied to an enemy during Global Silence, ensuring the silence at the end of the delay. This can extend the duration of silence on a single enemy.<br/>Global Silence is usually used in team fights, at times where the enemy usually wants to cast spells. Applying Arcane Curse on enemies in such situations can greatly increase the damage they take, or prevent them from casting spells even further. Arcane Curse's effect even stacks with itself, so when having Global Silence upgraded, placing 2 curses on enemies can have devastating outcomes.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Skywrath Mage is a very strong nuker whose spells allow him to deal tremendous amounts of magic damage to enemy heroes. If left uninterrupted, he is a force to be reckoned with and is capable of destroying enemy heroes by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage from spells<br/>Long cast range<br/>High mana pool<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very fragile<br/>Low armor<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Beware that Skywrath Mage's extremely low strength and agility gives him very little HP and armor, resulting in severe vulnerability against physical damage. The combination of low HP and high nuke damage also renders him vulnerable to reflected damage, meaning that enemies who buy a Blade Mail can cause him to connive in his own destruction if they have more HP than him.<br/>Due to the long cast range on his spells, Skywrath is capable of casting his spells on enemies safely from behind his allies, in order to mitigate his frailty. As such, positioning is very important as inadvertently getting too close to the enemy can result in his demise. His high base movement speed and near-instant cast animations allow him to take advantage of his long range, however his moves must be planned and calculated as his slow turn rate counteracts this.<br/>Skywrath Mage has the third-highest intelligence growth in the game, which means that his mana pool is often large enough to accommodate all of his spells. However, beware that this can be turned against you depending on the enemies you are facing, as certain abilities are particularly effective against Skywrath Mage, such as Nether Ward, Mana Void and Mana Burn. Plan for counters against such situations if needed, and be prepared to purchase items to shield yourself from such abilities.<br/>Due to the potency of his nukes, Skywrath Mage is capable of being played in a number of ways.<br/>In the most general case, Skywrath Mage is a potent safe-lane support. He can spam Arcane Bolt to harass the enemy off-laner away while dealing respectable amounts of damage, and can slow them from range and silence them during kill attempts. As a casting support, he is capable of dealing large amounts of damage relying only on his spells, meaning that he can be effective with just levels.<br/>Due to his strong nuking power, Skywrath Mage can be a very potent mid-laner. His ability to wear down his lane opponent from range, as well as disable and burst them down with his spells, can make him a powerful threat in almost any match-up. With good gold and experience gain, Skywrath Mage's spells can become a force to be reckoned with, allowing him to burst down and kill enemy heroes with relative ease.<br/>Skywrath Mage's combination of high movement speed and powerful nuking ability make him a strong roamer and ganker. Possession of a long-range slow in Concussive Shot and a silence in Ancient Seal allow him to apply disables to enemies and burst them down with his spells, especially if combined with a partner with disables. As he requires experience and gold to avoid falling off in the late game, getting early kills can help him to remain a powerful threat throughout a match.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arcane Bolt</h4>Arcane Bolt is a low-cost spammable targeted nuke that scales with Skywrath Mage's intelligence.<br/>Arcane Bolt is a very strong harassment spell that also serves as a substitute for physical attacks with enough intelligence. It can become a very powerful and spammable magic nuke past the laning stage as it grows stronger alongside Skywrath Mage.<br/>In the laning stage, Skywrath Mage can use Arcane Bolt to easily harass his lane opponent out of the lane, as its low mana cost and low cooldown allow him to use it extremely frequently. As it is a single-target spell, it does not draw aggro, so it can be cast without fear of inadvertently pushing the lane. However, beware that consistent use of Arcane Bolt will quickly build up charges for enemies' Magic Sticks, so balance your use of the spell accordingly.<br/>The scaling nature of Arcane Bolt makes it a strong magic nuke at all stages of the game, as it is one of very few magic nukes that gains power alongside Skywrath Mage. Building powerful intelligence items boosts Skywrath's base damage, the size of his mana pool, and the amount of damage that Arcane Bolt deals, making him a strong threat the more farm he has. The scaling nature and low cooldown of the spell, 2 seconds at level 4, allows Skywrath Mage to use Arcane Bolt as an augmentation for his right-clicks, nuking down single targets very quickly as long as he has enough mana regen to keep up. This allows Skywrath to push creep waves or farm most neutral camps very quickly, giving him levels and gold.<br/>Keep in mind, prolonged use of Arcane Bolt can drain your mana pool alarmingly quickly, even if you have already purchased many intelligence items. Mana regen is a necessity if you want to be able to cast your other spells when they are needed.<br/>Unlike most other targeted abilities, Arcane Bolt cannot be disjointed, and will continue to follow its target and eventually damage them even if they blink away or turn invisible. You can use this to hunt down evasive targets, as the projectile provides flying vision as it homes in on its target.<h4>Concussive Shot</h4>Concussive Shot automatically launches a magical projectile that homes in on the closest enemy hero, damaging and slowing them.<br/>Its long cast range allows Skywrath Mage to use Concussive Shot to slow an enemy from a great distance away. As it also homes in on the closest available target and has an instant cast time, the spell can be used as an initiating spell to slow a target at the start of an engagement, a finisher to catch a fleeing enemy who has escaped beyond the range of your other spells, or as an escape by slowing the closest pursuer without breaking stride.<br/>If enemies are clumped up due to being affected by an ally's crowd-control spell (such as Vacuum, Berserker's Call or Reverse Polarity), casting Concussive shot into the group can allow you to damage and slow multiple enemy heroes with a single cast.<br/>Concussive Shot will not target illusions, making it a powerful hero detection tool. If you are facing an illusion-based hero such as Phantom Lancer, Chaos Knight or Terrorblade, using Concussive Shot will cause it to automatically home in on the real hero, provided that they are the closest target for the spell. If the spell fizzles, then it means that the hero is not present. This can also be used to counter Manta Style by pinpointing the real hero among the illusions.<h4>Ancient Seal</h4>Ancient Seal is a long-ranged targeted silence ability that reduces the magic resistance of its target.<br/>Ancient Seal's magic resistance reduction is one of the strongest in the game, beaten only by Pugna's Decrepify. It allows Skywrath Mage to continue to deal tremendous amounts of magical damage even in the late game when enemies' health pools get large enough to shrug off most other magic nukes.<br/>Ancient Seal is a strong ability for countering enemy mages who rely on casting their spells to be effective in teamfights. Its long cast range allows Skywrath to silence them from relative safety, and increase the damage they take from Skywrath's spells in order to permanently remove them from the field.<br/>In the early game, it is recommended to take at least one value point in Ancient Seal, as a 3-second silence can prevent gank targets from casting their escape spells or counter-disabling, on top of greatly increasing their vulnerability to allies' initiating magic nukes as well as those of Skywrath himself. A 30% magic resistance reduction is enough to almost completely negate most heroes' base magic resistance, allowing them to take almost full damage from allied magic nukes.<h4>Mystic Flare</h4>Mystic Flare bombards the target area with numerous waves of magic damage, dealing a large amount of damage that is split evenly amongst all enemy heroes in the area.<br/>Mystic Flare consumes a significant fraction of Skywrath Mage's mana pool, but is one of the most devastating magic nukes in the game and has a very short cooldown for the amount of damage it deals. Properly used, it can allow Skywrath to kill almost any hero in the game when combined with his other spells.<br/>Mystic Flare's damage is unreliable, as it only deals damage so long as the enemy is within its small radius, which can be escaped as Skywrath does not have any disables that can completely immobilize a target, nor can he build any items that provide one. In general, it is best to set up your ultimate by casting Concussive Shot to slow the target first, and then add another slow or disable if possible (such as Rod of Atos or Scythe of Vyse) to reduce their mobility further. The best course of action is to let a teammate disable the target through a root, taunt or stun, so that they are unable to move at all for the duration of the ultimate.<br/>Keep in mind, Ancient Seal not only increases the damage that the target will take, but can prevent them from casting any escape spells that allow them to displace themselves outside of the field. If a stun is not available, then casting Ancient Seal on top of Concussive Shot can help to pin the target down.<br/>Remember that Mystic Flare distributes its damage evenly among all heroes in the field, but ignores illusions. As such, it is strong against illusion heroes (on top of Concussive Shot allowing you to reveal the true hero among the illusions), but also allows its damage to be more than halved by another enemy player or two stepping into the field to split the damage. This makes Mystic Flare unusual for an area-of-effect spell as it is strong for killing lone targets but is weak against groups of enemies.<br/>One of Mystic Flare's greatest weaknesses is that Force Staff can be used on its target in order to almost immediately push them to safety. This makes Scythe of Vyse ever more invaluable as a disable tool and emphasizes the spell's single-target nature, as using the spell on an enemy who does not have any nearby allies prevents them from being Forced to safety, and Hex prevents the target from using items as well as spells, preventing them from using their own Force Staff on themselves.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Storm Spirit Storm Spirit is a very mobile ganker who thrives on an aggressive play style. While he is very mana-hungry and difficult to master, he more than makes up for this by rewarding players with aggressive mindsets and good dexterity, who can use his abilities to jump on foes from extremely long distances, pummel them down with tremendous amounts of magical damage, and escape before their allies can turn on him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Incredibly mobile.<br/>High snowball potential.<br/>Low cooldowns on all of his skills.<br/>Can reliably solo-kill most fragile heroes.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can run out of mana very quickly without proper management.<br/>Very vulnerable in the early game.<br/>Very farm dependent.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>In order to make the most of his mobility, Storm Spirit's first priority should be to build items that give him both mana and mana regen. Ball Lightning allows him to initiate and escape at will, making him very hard to catch in the hands of a skilled player, however it consumes large amounts of his mana pool, meaning that life or death literally rests on how much mana Storm Spirit can muster up when needed.<br/>Storm Spirit is most generally played in the mid lane, as his abilities make him an extremely powerful hero to have early levels and gold on. While he is quite weak and vulnerable before he hits level 6, he becomes a force to be reckoned with once he obtains access to his ultimate.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Static Remnant</h4>Static Remnant drops a remnant on Storm Spirit's position upon cast, detonating when an enemy walks into its trigger radius or when it expires.<br/>In the laning stage, Static Remnant can be used to apply nuke damage to a creep wave, useful for getting multiple last-hits at once or pushing the lane in order to buy yourself space to check the runes. However, it is also dangerous since the spell's small radius means that Storm Spirit, a ranged hero with low HP, must walk into melee range of the creep wave in order to make the most of it. Make sure that the enemy cannot easily capitalize on this disadvantageous positioning before doing this.<br/>If your laning opponent is a melee hero, Static Remnant would be very effective to prevent them from lasthitting. Cast Remnant when the hero comes close to the creep wave to apply the damage, also with attack and Overload proc.<br/>Due to its area-of-effect nature and low mana cost and cooldown, Static Remnant can be a useful spell for farming neutral camps, especially if they have been stacked. Each remnant can deal its damage to the entire camp if placed close enough, reducing the amount of time required to farm them.<br/>Mind the delay between placement and materialization of a Static Remnant. Smart enemies can run outside of its radius in the second after placing the remnant, so try to make sure that the enemy is otherwise disabled in order to land the explosion on them. Position yourself using Ball Lightning and cast Static Remnant on their escape route to inflict more damage or for enemies to change their path.<br/>Static Remnant has an instant cast time, allowing Storm Spirit to place them without breaking stride. When running from enemies, leaving a Static Remnant in your wake can discourage enemies from pursuing in the early game if they cannot afford to take the damage.<br/>Keep in mind, a Static Remnant will still explode if an invisible enemy enters its radius. If a Static Remnant explodes without a visible enemy entering its radius, but before its expiration time, it means that an invisible enemy is approaching.<br/>Static Remnant gives flying vision for its duration, which allows it to be used to gain vision through the fog of war. This can be used to check inside Roshan's pit, or to see over trees and high ground. It can be particularly useful when placed behind a tree, as enemies will be unable to see the remnant but it will still provide vision of them until it explodes.<h4>Electric Vortex</h4>Electric Vortex is a short disable that stuns its target as it is pulled in.<br/>As a general rule of thumb, Electric Vortex has little value at level 1, and is only useful for catching enemies at level 3 or higher, so it should either have multiple early skill points put into it in order to increase Storm Spirit's disable potential, or altogether ignored in the early game for more damage output through his other spells.<br/>Still, putting a single point is okay to proc Overload one more time in short period, hinder enemy's movement to get more chance to attack, also interrupt Town Portal Scrolls.<br/>At any level, Electric Vortex can pull an enemy into the explosion radius of Static Remnant, provided that it was already placed at the same location that Storm Spirit casts Electric Vortex from. However, keep in mind that Static Remnant takes time to materialize, and at level 1 Electric Vortex only pulls for just barely the theoretical amount of time and distance needed for this; in practical terms, a fleeing enemy and the delay between commands means that they will likely run outside of the remnant before it materializes unless Electric Vortex is cast on a target inside of its maximum range. Regardless, it is wise to put at least two levels into Electric Vortex in order to ensure that enemies will be caught by a Static Remnant.<br/>Beware that Electric Vortex will also halve Storm Spirit's movement speed upon casting, meaning that he is unable to easily move himself to a more advantageous position to attack or cast his other spells. As such, the only ways to reliably re-position are either to have activated a Haste rune or to cast Ball Lightning.<h4>Overload</h4>Overload is the linchpin that links together all of Storm Spirit's abilities and augments the amount of damage that his physical attacks deal.<br/>Overload procs every time Storm Spirit casts any of his spells. As such, mastery of Storm Spirit requires that players learn to attack targets between every spell in order to maximize the amount of damage dealt.<br/>The area-of-effect nature of Overload allows for it to be used as a farming spell. Throwing an Overload charge at the center of a group of creeps will apply the damage and slow to all of them, which allows Storm Spirit to deal aftershock damage to groups of creeps after using a spell.<br/>The damage from Overload also allows it to be used as a harassing spell in the laning stage, especially in the mid lane due to easier access to runes to replenish mana using bottle. Hitting enemy player with attack together with Overload damage is the main way to harass a ranged hero since most of them won't trigger Static Remnant often. However, the attack range of Storm Spirit is relatively short - 480 compared to Queen of Pain's 550 or Lina's 670. Laning with an experienced player of these heroes would be dreadful. Use the damage of Overload to lasthit to counteract heroes with either long attack range or high attack damage, such as Shadow Fiend and Viper, to gain gold and experience instead of harassing.<br/>If the enemy is standing close to a creep (such as the ranged creep), attacking that creep with the Overload charge can deal splash damage to the enemy player without drawing aggro.<br/>Keep in mind, attacks will check for Overload procs when they successfully connect. As such, it is possible to throw an attack, and then cast a spell while the projectile is mid-air, and the projectile will still proc Overload on its target. This can be used to get kills on low-health enemies who are fleeing, but who will escape before a spell comes off cooldown for proccing Overload prior to attacking; attacking and then casting a spell to proc Overload will cause the subsequent attack to deal its damage and slow.<br/>Beware that attacking spell immune units, particularly ancients and wards, will still proc Overload even if it will not deal the damage or slow on that unit. In the early game when Storm Spirit's mana is still finite, this can result in a wasted Overload proc, so be careful about which targets to attack in order to maximize the usage of Storm Spirit's mana.<h4>Ball Lightning</h4>Ball Lightning makes Storm Spirit one of the most mobile and deadly heroes in the game, as it gives him strong initiation and escape potential. However, it is also one of the most mana-costly spells in the game, so good mana management is key to playing Storm Spirit well.<br/>Because Ball Lightning's mana cost is expressed as a percentage of Storm Spirit's total mana pool, it is crucial to build mana regen items on him, since the mana cost of the spell increases in tandem with the size of his mana pool. By focusing on mana regen, Storm Spirit can quickly replenish the mana used by his ultimate between engagements, allowing him to be ready for another one shortly after.<br/>Keep in mind that Ball Lightning does have a flat mana cost for each activation as well as per distance traveled. The larger Storm Spirit's mana pool is, the more negligible this flat cost becomes. As well, a larger mana pool also reduces the cost of his other spells relative to how much mana he has, allowing for more profligate use of Static Remnant.<br/>Storm Spirit is invulnerable during Ball Lightning, so he cannot be damaged, disabled or otherwise affected by most spells in the game. As such, it can be cast to disjoint incoming projectiles or to avoid other types of damage and disables if timed properly.<br/>As Ball Lightning has no cooldown, it can be used to travel over short distances to proc Overload. This can be a powerful, albeit costly way to add more damage to Storm Spirit's attacks during ganks.<br/>Items can still be used, and Storm Spirit can still attack during Ball Lightning. During initiations, this means that enemies can be disabled prior to arrival with items like Orchid Malevolence and Scythe of Vyse, an Overload attack can be made before emerging, and Shiva's Guard can be activated to expand its radius to encompass multiple enemies. This also means that during escapes, Town Portal Scroll can be channeled during the jump, allowing Storm Spirit to put distance between himself and any pursuing enemies while channeling.<br/>When using Ball Lightning to initiate or escape, it is sometimes wise to only jump the minimum distance necessary, due to the spell's high mana cost. Making unnecessarily long jumps will drain Storm Spirit's mana quickly, allowing for less mana to be used for attacks and disables upon reaching a gank target, or allowing for less mana for making a secondary escape jump if needed.<br/>Never discount the damage that Ball Lightning itself deals if it connects with a target, especially when upgraded to Level 3. When initiating over longer distances, it can put a respectable amount of damage on the table, increasing the odds of a successful kill. However, doing so effectively requires Storm Spirit to land right on top of, or pass right over the enemy, which requires additional skill since the target's path must be predicted right when the jump is made.<br/>The massive initiation potential of Ball Lightning means that Storm Spirit can engage foes who are behind their teammates, focusing down squishy supports with low HP at the beginning of fights. This can be useful for removing them from the picture before they can cast any of their powerful teamfight spells, or use any crucial items such as Mekansm or Pipe of Insight.<br/>Initiating on and killing enemies requires good mechanical skills and planning in order to make the most of all of Storm Spirit's spells. The textbook initiation is: Ball Lightning to close the distance > Cast disable while en route ( Orchid Malevolence) > Overload attack (if no quick counteract items such as Manta Style or Black King Bar in terms of Orchid Malevolence) > Electric Vortex > Overload attack > Static Remnant > Overload attack > Ball Lightning over short distance > Overload attack > Repeat as needed using either Static Remnant or Ball Lightning > Escape with Ball Lightning if necessary. With Scythe of Vyse more actions could be applied before casting Electric Vortex.<br/>You can cast Ball Lightning during Ball Lightning, but if you reach its cast point and you're still traveling, it fails casting. When you travel to a bad location and you still have enough mana, you can cast Ball Lightning to the right direction at about 375~522.5/562.5~783.75/750~1045 (0.3*1250/1875/2500, and because of turn rate) distance to destination. If you succeed, you would turn to right direction right after you land without any trails.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Techies is a very unorthodox hero in the game, as their team contribution comes mainly from placing traps outside of combat rather than engaging enemies in fights. Playing Techies requires good map awareness and game sense in order to know when and where to place traps.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high attack range.<br/>Excellent base armor (7).<br/>Not dependent on teamfights to be effective.<br/>Very long root with Stasis Trap.<br/>Can deny self with Blast Off!.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very mana dependent in the early game.<br/>Low starting health.<br/>Lowest starting damage.<br/>Easily countered by silence and summoned units.<br/>Very low mobility.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Techies are also one of the few heroes able to truly mess with the enemy. Play mind games with them. Do not force yourself into any habits, while making sure you continually adapt to theirs.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Proximity Mines</h4>The Proximity Mines get revealed when there is an enemy within an 400 AOE and triggers if they stay in the AOE for 1.6 seconds.<h4>As they become visible to the enemy when they are in range, you need to stack them like a Venn diagramm with a Stasis Trap covering the middle part, so if an unaware enemy walks into the Stasis radius, he gets rooted and all three mines should explode. By creating a lattice of Proximity Mines and Stasis Traps pairs, you can ensure that the enemy will get hit anyway if he force-staffs himself forward.</h4>It is highly recommended to max out this skill first, and spend most of the game laying Proximity Mines down across the map, preferably in unexpected places, where the enemy is likely to go when he runs away from a gank. As a rule of thumb, you should never have this spell off cooldown.<h4>However, you should nt spend the entire game planting them outside of lanes. As a single level 3 proximity mine can clear out an entire creep wave they make the bread and butter of your Gold-per-Minute, and they also deal huge damage to towers, so you should spend a fair amount of time pushing lanes and taking towers quietly when the enemy team is busy somewhere else.</h4>Proximity Mines still trigger if an invisible enemy walks over them, letting you know when one of them is coming your way.<h4>A great combo is to wait for the enemy to walk into a Stasis Trap stacked on top of a Proximity Mine, then Blast Off! on top of him and place another Proximity Mine right as the first one explodes, netting you 2200 Magical damage before damage amplification/reduction.</h4>Stasis Trap<br/>[edit | edit source]<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tinker is a very mobile nuking hero with powerful pushing and disabling potential depending on how he is built. He should be played around his ultimate, as it allows him to cast his spells and use his abilities multiple times in a single engagement.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful magical and pure damage nukes, high damage AoE magic damage.<br/>Very hard to push against without specific items or team composition.<br/>Skillful players can outplay multiple opponents by themselves.<br/>Generally extremely effective against single targets with the use of items in conjunction with Rearm.<br/>Semi-Global presence when Boots of Travel are acquired.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item dependent<br/>Vulnerable to lockdown, fragile, no innate escape mechanism.<br/>High skill ceiling, high levels of awareness and dexterity needed to play effectively.<br/>No answer to Magic Immunity.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>When pushing out lanes, care must be taken to avoid being jumped on by the enemy. Tinker is a very frail hero who, despite his mobility, can be easily killed if caught and disabled.<br/>As well, while Tinker can find farm quite easily by pushing out multiple lanes, doing so can deprive your own teammates of farm, particularly your carries. Combined with the above, this can lead to dangerous situations where your team is unable to do anything without you, and can lead to a loss in the long run as the enemy is able to kill your under-farmed teammates easily if they manage to kill you once. As such, it is recommended not to push out lanes too aggressively or take farm away from your carries if possible.<br/>In general, Tinker is best played in the mid lane, as his skill set allows him to take on most other mids reliably and the farm and early levels allow him to become active much more quickly. He can nuke down and harass the opposing mid and push his lane at will with his abilities, allowing for good rune control.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Laser</h4>Laser is a strong Pure damage nuke that inflicts blind on its target. It is a powerful harassing tool against the enemy mid as the blind allows Tinker to last-hit a creep that the enemy is attempting to deny, or vice versa.<br/>Never underestimate Laser's ability to change the course of an engagement. Using it against an enemy hero prevents them from trading hits due to the miss, and used against the proper target in a teamfight it can force them to retreat or activate a Black King Bar at an inopportune time to remove the blind.<br/> Laser can also be used as a supplementary nuke when pushing a lane. The blindness lasts for 6 seconds on creeps, so it can be used on a siege creep both to remove its attack output and weaken it for March of the Machines.
<br/>It can be a nice last hit ability while in the lane, especially against siege creeps due to the pure damage.<h4>Heat-Seeking Missile</h4>Heat-Seeking Missile has an extremely long range. With Rearm, you can continuously spam missiles as to harass enemy heroes and wear them down in preparation of a fight.<br/>Due to its long range, Heat-Seeking Missile is also a good finishing spell for killing fleeing enemies who are low on health. If an enemy has escaped an engagement but is still within vision range, launching a missile can be all that is needed to finish them off.<br/>Remember that vision over the target is required in order for Heat-Seeking Missiles to acquire lock. This means that not only are Observer Wards important in spotting out targets, but that the spell also has great synergy with heroes with vision abilities such as Corrosive Haze, Thirst and Track, which can reveal targets when ward vision is unavailable.<br/>When ganking a target with your burst damage spells and items, it is best to lead off with Heat-Seeking Missile. The travel time can be used to apply a powerful alpha strike to a target by firing the missiles first, and then blinking within range to use your other nukes just as the missiles reach their target.<br/>Combined with Aghanim's Scepter, Heat-Seeking Missiles can lock on to four nearby targets at a time. This can allow Tinker to bombard the entire enemy team with large amounts of magical damage, especially when combined with Rearm, softening them up for teammates.<h4>March of the Machines</h4>March of the Machines is a powerful farming, pushing and counter-pushing spell, as enemies cannot avoid the damage if they wish to attack anything in the affected area. You can overlap several instances of the spell with Rearm, easily nuking down creeps and creating hazard zones that inflict large amounts of damage to enemies who attempt to traverse them.<br/>Keep in mind that the drones march in whatever direction Tinker casts the spell in. This can make a major difference when mowing down creep waves, as the drones destroy themselves upon hitting a target. This means that lane creeps can effectively shield each other, leaving certain ones alive for longer (like the ranged creep, which deals the most damage) and preventing others from taking any damage. The most optimal way to March down a wave of lane creeps is in a diagonal angle from behind, so that the drones can hit all of the creeps in the wave, and attack the ranged creeps first.<br/>In general, only two casts of level 4 March of the Machines is necessary for killing a creep wave, provided that they are cast in the proper direction. Remember that the drones take time to deal their damage, so do not get too trigger-happy and waste mana on a third cast if you do not see them doing a lot of immediate damage.<br/>As well, remember that the drones start their March from one end of the area and take time to reach the other end, so casting the spell in one direction causes the drones to spawn from the opposite direction first. This can be important in fights as it can allow you to start applying damage to the enemy team a few seconds earlier, which can make a huge difference.<br/>March of the Machine's wide area allows Tinker to use it to farm down multiple jungle camps at once, both in Radiant and Dire jungles. As well, his global mobility allows him to farm the enemy's jungle if needed, reserving his team's jungle for his team's carries.<br/>It is important to keep in mind that creep movement makes a difference in what direction March of the Machines should be cast in. Casting March in a direction perpendicular to the movement direction of creeps, whether they are lane creeps or neutrals, causes the most number of drones possible to hit them as they travel.<h4>Rearm</h4>Rearm is Tinker's signature ability, allowing him to cast spells and use item abilities profligately as long as he has the mana to do so. Combined with Boots of Travel, it allows Tinker to become one of the most active heroes in the game, globally repositioning himself to push lanes, gank enemies and take map objectives.<br/>Because Rearm increases drastically in mana cost as it is leveled up, only one level in the ability should be taken until at least one large mana item can be purchased to buff up the size of his mana pool. The reduced channel time only matters once you have enough powerful items that you can take advantage of in teamfights.<br/>You can stack commands by holding Shift (also called Shift-queuing) to prevent unintentional Rearm interruptions. Tinker performs queued commands immediately after finishing Rearm.<br/>One of the most important factors in playing Tinker well is efficiently managing his mana pool. As Rearm removes cooldown limitations on his spells and most item abilities, you must carefully decide which spells to cast in a teamfight or when pushing, as well as how to most efficiently cast these spells depending on the situation. Using an unnecessary spell reduces Tinker's ability to cast additional spells in the same engagement, forcing an earlier return back to base and reducing his efficiency.<br/>Always keep enough mana handy to escape and teleport back to base, as Tinker is a very squishy and vulnerable hero when caught out in the open.<br/>When replenishing your mana in your fountain, remember that it heals as a percentage of your maximum HP and mana, and adds a flat amount on top. Therefore, it is possible to reduce down time in the fountain by moving your core items to your stash in order to reduce the size of your mana pool, thus increasing the effectiveness of the flat regen. Combined with a Bottle, this can drastically reduce your turnaround time, allowing you to get back into the action faster.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Visage is a highly flexible Hero, able to push and gank very effectively, packing within his abilities a massive nuke with very low cooldown and one powerful slow, useful for taking down enemies when ganking. He is also a strong teamfighter, able to cause tons of damage and apply long-lasting disables with his Familiars, which give Visage its fame for his difficult learning curve, due to his dependence on effective micromanagement of those. Once mastered, Visage becomes a devastating support, with a mix between physical damage, magical damage and long length disables and able to push, gank and fight with his Familiars.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals large amounts of single target damage.<br/>Can end up being extremely durable.<br/>Capable of quickly transitioning into a semi-carry with successful ganks.<br/>Movement Speed and attack speed drain, which can be useful in many ways.<br/>AoE long length stun.<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable early game.<br/>Level dependent.<br/>Requires intermediate micro skills.<br/>Loses effectiveness if Familiars are dead.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Visage's abilities make him a very strong hero to have in teamfights, as he can bring a powerful array of nukes and disables to bear. He can also use his spells effectively in ganks to jump on and disable targets with little warning and burst them down quickly.<br/>Unlike most intelligence supports, Visage is a very survivable caster due to possessing a high strength growth and powerful damage resistance in Gravekeeper's Cloak. Combined with his other spells, Visage can engage enemies head-on in teamfights and hold his own in the initiation phase.<br/>With a 0.2 second cast animation and long cast ranges on his spells, Visage has great reach if played properly. However, his low base movement speed and slow turn rate also make him relatively sluggish, so positioning is important if he is to take advantage of his strengths.<br/>While Visage is mainly played as a support, he can also become a strong semi-carry if given some farm priority. He can be played as a hard support or a farming support, depending on what his team needs, and transition into a roaming, ganking and split-pushing role.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Grave Chill</h4>Grave Chill is a targeted disable that reduces the enemy's movement and attack speed while boosting up Visage's.<br/>Because of its scaling, only one early point in Grave Chill is needed. Each additional level only increases its duration slightly, and the reduced cooldown does not become useful until much later in the game.<br/>Grave Chill is a very strong ganking spell, as it can inflict a strong slow on an enemy while also robbing them of attack speed, allowing Visage to position himself to easily body-block the enemy's escape path while bursting them down with right-click attacks. These aspects also make Grave Chill a strong counter-gank spell, since it can greatly hinder an enemy that is chasing a weakened ally and reduce their ability to finish off their target with right-clicks, allowing Visage to turn the tables on them.<br/>The increased attack speed provided by Grave Chill means that Visage benefits from building intelligence items rather than simply mana items. Not only will increased intelligence give Visage a bigger mana pool, but it will also increase his base damage to allow him to use his right-clicks more effectively due to the attack speed bonus.<h4>Soul Assumption</h4>Soul Assumption is a potentially powerful damage nuke that increases in strength based on the amount of damage that heroes in Visage's vicinity take.<br/>Soul Assumption makes Visage extremely powerful in tri-lanes, as the amount of damage dealt during ganks and small-scale engagements allow Visage to quickly build up Soul Assumption charges to launch a powerful nuke at an enemy. Additionally, its extremely short cooldown allows it to be cast more than once in a fight, which can allow Visage to deal more and more damage the longer a fight drags on.<br/>Soul Assumption's long cast range makes it a powerful finishing nuke against fleeing enemies. If an enemy has been weakened by allied attacks and spells and is almost about to escape, casting Soul Assumption on them can often be enough to finish them off if the salvo has built up enough charges.<br/>Keep in mind that Soul Assumption builds charges based on damage taken on both sides. This means that not only can Visage add more damage on top of his teammates' when damaging an enemy, but also when allies or Visage himself take damage, making it a strong nuke no matter which side is ganking.<br/>Due to the limited window during which charges are maintained, Soul Assumption is more powerful in situations where burst damage is being dealt, as damage-over-time spells can result in charges expiring over time.<br/>Because of its high nuking potential, Visage benefits greatly from maxing out Soul Assumption first among his abilities. The huge nuke potential of the spell allows Visage to deal large amounts of damage whenever fights break out, giving his team more chances at getting kills against the enemy.<br/>Beware that since Soul Assumption has a very low cooldown, it is easy to run out of mana to cast it if used repeatedly. Be mindful of when kill opportunities are possible, and try to conserve Visage's mana as needed.<br/>Due to its low cooldown, Soul Assumption can be cast as an initiating nuke to break an enemy's Linken's Sphere prior to slowing them with Grave Chill. After breaking an enemy's Linken's Sphere, Grave Chill's low cooldown allows it to be cast at least two more times without interference.<h4>Gravekeeper's Cloak</h4>Gravekeeper's Cloak is a powerful survivability passive that gives Visage increased armor and magic resistance.<br/>The layered nature of Gravekeeper's Cloak makes Visage quite resistant to burst damage, which can help him to shrug off initiation nukes by the enemy. However, this also makes Visage very weak against damage over time spells, as multiple small instances of damage can easily shred the resistance layers and leave Visage open to nukes.<br/>Getting multiple early levels of Gravekeeper's Cloak can make Visage quite survivable in the early game, particularly when few enemies have the attack speed to use their auto-attacks to quickly shred the cloak. However, beware if the enemy team's composition is capable of dealing damage over time, which can easily negate armor layers.<br/>Even with multiple levels in Gravekeeper's Cloak, it is recommended to build up Visage's armor and magic resistance, in order to give him some measure of survivability if he must engage the enemy without his armor layers. Armor is more helpful than magic resistance in this regard, since Visage's abnormally high strength growth means that he will eventually have enough HP to outright ignore most magic nukes.<h4>Summon Familiars</h4>Summon Familiars allows Visage to summon two Familiars that can roam the battlefield.<br/>Proper Familiar management is crucial in order to play Visage effectively. Used properly, the Familiars allow Visage to gank targets, push undefended lanes, chain-disable multiple enemies, and deal large amounts of burst damage in fights.<br/>Unlike other summons, Familiars will last until they are destroyed, and can still be controlled even if Visage himself is dead. Try to always be active with the Familiars, using them to accomplish tasks no matter Visage's status.<br/>The most powerful aspects of Visage's Familiars is that they possess flying movement that allows them to ignore terrain. However, while they are very mobile they also have extremely poor vision range and extremely low attack range, making them poor scouters and forcing them to attack enemies at close range.<br/>Familiars' charge-based attacks and low base attack time allow them to deal tremendous burst physical damage to enemies when they focus their fire. Combined with their flying mobility, Familiars become powerful gankers and can quickly kill fragile supports behind enemy lines. However, their reliance on damage charges in order to deal damage also cause their attacks to become extremely weak after expending all their attack charges.<br/>Because of their ability to ignore terrain, Familiars can find safety in hovering over trees, where the enemy cannot easily find them. They can also escape destruction by flying over impassable terrain in order to prevent enemies from easily pursuing.<br/>Remember that the Familiars do not have to be at Visage's side all the time. There are many strong advantages to moving them all around the map, since they can be used to assist teammates who are ganking on a different part of the map, push an undefended lane, attack the enemy from behind during a teamfight, and many other uses. Be creative with how the Familiars are used, and try to always catch the enemy off-guard.<br/>Be very wary of the long cooldown on Summon Familiars, and try not to allow the enemy to kill the Familiars. Not only will this give the enemy a large gold bounty, but can leave Visage without his primary method of burst damage when he needs them.<br/>If the enemy is about to kill the Familiars and they have no path to escape, casting Summon Familiars will instantly kill any active Familiars, preventing the enemy from getting a gold or experience bounty. However, beware that this will also leave Visage without his Familiars for an extended period of time if they are killed again.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Warlock is a powerful spellcaster capable of turning the tide of teamfights, bringing the Hell powers with his abilities, bonding his enemies to suffer with the same catastrophic fate. He is almost entirely dependent on good positioning, due to lack of front line abilities, but has great cast ranges on his abilities, allowing you to disrupt your enemies from long distances. Warlock also brings a good healing that can also be used to damage enemies, doing a fine job as a lane partner. His ultimate, Chaotic Offering, calls down a powerful summon along with a magic immunity piercing stun that covers the battlefield almost entirely, causing some huge troubles to your enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Many teamfight abilities.<br/>Has a good heal/damage ability.<br/>The Golem can unleash tons of AoE damage, rather efficient for farming waves or the jungle.<br/>Huge AoE 84% slow ( Upheaval).<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No good escape ability<br/>Mildly low mana pool.<br/>Upheaval requires channeling.<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Warlock is renowned as a strong teamfight hero whose spells can shift the tide of engagements against multiple foes. While he does not possess any immediate single-target hard disables or instant-damage nukes, his spells provide powerful area disable and crowd control, making him a dangerous foe in teamfights.<br/>Despite being an intelligence caster, Warlock has very respectable strength growth, giving him strong survivability against magic and pure damage nukes. However, he also suffers from extremely poor base agility and agility growth, making him vulnerable to physical damage.<br/>Because he relies mostly on casting spells in order to be effective, Warlock should build items that provide him with more mana, mana regen, and mobility. Having a sustainable source of mana allows Warlock to remain active on the map to support his team, and mobility allows Warlock to more easily position to cast his spells. Once he meets his minimum requirements, he can focus on building utility items to help his team, and survivability items to ensure that he does not die before getting his spells off.<br/>Keep in mind that Warlock has a very long cast animation, 0.5 seconds on all but Fatal Bonds. This means that positioning and planning ahead are key to using the hero effectively, as his spells take more time to cast than most other heroes.<br/>In general, Warlock should be played as a safe lane support hero rather than as a core farmer. Although he can scale better than most other supports due to the nature of his spells, he is more dependent on levels than on gold, so foregoing farm in favor of supporting can still allow him to contribute to his team.<br/>When you play Warlock, awareness is key. He does not have a good escape, and can be easily caught by ganks if there is no vision.<br/>Warlock can often turn the tide of teamfights due to his many teamfighting abilities, so always carry a Town Portal Scroll and try to get to a team fight as soon as possible if you were not in it initially.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fatal Bonds</h4>Fatal Bonds is a unit-targeted debuff that allows Warlock to link multiple enemies together to deal bonus damage to each one when one of their allies takes damage.<br/>Fatal Bonds is a very powerful teamfight ability, as it can cause area-of-effect spells that hit all bonded units to deal more than twice its listed damage to each foe. While it should not be the first spell that you max out, it should still be a priority spell to level up, and cast as early as possible in a teamfight.<br/>Because of its extremely long cast range and short cast animation, Fatal Bonds should be the first spell cast in a teamfight. However, be mindful that it will only bond enemies that are currently visible, so make sure to wait for the right moment in order to catch the maximum number of enemy heroes.<br/>Fatal Bonds selects which units to bond based on proximity to the target. Keep this in mind when selecting an enemy to cast the spell on, and try to target it on an enemy in the center of a group of other enemy heroes to maximize the chances of bonding heroes rather than creeps.<br/>When deciding at what time to skill Fatal Bonds, gauge how active your team will be in engaging the foe in major teamfights. If you do not expect to encounter 5-vs-5 teamfights early on, then it is safe to level up your other abilities first. However, if the enemy team is employing an early pushing strategy, threatening them with large amounts of shared damage that is magnified by area-of-effect nukes can give them pause.<br/>Keep in mind that Fatal Bonds damage is reduced by each individual target's resistances, so dealing reduced damage to an enemy with high armor or magic resistance will not propagate that reduction to other shackled units. However, the reverse also applies, as dealing large amounts of damage to an enemy with little armor or magic resistance will not amplify the damage shared by an enemy that is more resilient.<br/>Fatal bonds can be cast from 1000 units away, so Warlock does not need to get close to use this.<br/>The shared damage is not reduced by the armor or resistance of the hero that initially took the damage, so it can kill off the enemy team if a high physical damage carry focuses on a high hp/armor enemy hero.<br/>The damage has no maximum range, so it prevents enemy heroes from escaping from a fight on low hp if they are linked to a hero still in the fight.<br/>Fatal bonds can stack, so you can apply another stack of fatal bonds and have each unit take 50% of the damage that any one of them takes.<h4>Shadow Word</h4>Shadow Word is Warlock's most flexible spell, capable of healing allies or damaging enemies, is effective in disabling items like Blink Dagger.<br/>Shadow Word should be the first spell to max out in most situations, as it can serve as a powerful nuke or a life-saving heal at any point in a match.<br/>Shadow Word costs 90 mana to heal/damage 180 HP at level 1, and will consume about a third of your mana pool to do so. Therefore, it is wise to avoid casting the spell at level 1 if at all possible, as it becomes much more efficient with additional levels.<br/>Beware that although Shadow Word can heal a single ally by more than 500 HP, it takes time to do so. Therefore, it should be cast as early as possible when a situation arises, so that your ally is not put in a situation where they might not have enough HP to survive long enough to benefit from the healing buff.<br/>Unlike certain healing spells, Shadow Word can be cast on spell immune allies. If an ally has activated their Black King Bar, Warlock can still target them with Shadow Word to heal them if they run into trouble.<br/>Offensive shadow words are less effective in the mid-late game, due to the relatively low help it provides the team in comparison to Warlock's other abilities.<br/>Shadow Word can help Warlock to stay longer in the lane and win the lane, by either casting offensive Shadow Words so that the enemy heroes are forced to stay back, or by allowing Warlock and his allies to remain at high health at all times.<h4>Upheaval</h4>Upheaval is a very large area slow with a very long cast range, capable of inflicting an increasingly powerful slow from up to 1850 range away.<br/>Despite its long cast range and wide radius of effect, Upheaval's slow takes time to build up, and ramps up very slowly at early levels. Try to avoid channeling the spell unless it is at least level 2 or 3, as it is otherwise a waste of mana.<br/>Keep in mind, Upheaval becomes stronger based on how long it is channeled, not how long an enemy was standing in it, and that the slow sticks on the target up to 3 seconds after leaving the area. Because of this, it is more effective to preemptively channel Upheaval where the enemy wants to pass through to give it time to build up, rather than casting the whirlpool on top of a foe's current location, since they can simply walk out of the whirlpool before they can be slowed too much.<br/>Upheaval can be used as a ganking disable once it has at least two points put into it, and combined with a leading stun to give the slow time to build up. Provided that Warlock's teammates have enough damage output, slowing the enemy down can be much more beneficial than attacking with right-clicks.<br/>Be sure to take advantage of Upheaval's long cast range whenever possible. The enemy will be sure to attempt to disable you to interrupt the channeling, however, you can make this much harder for them by forcing them to find you first. You can shield yourself behind teammates, from inside the treeline or on high ground, and even cast it from an unexpected direction so that they search in the wrong place.<br/>Upheaval's primary use comes right after initiating or counter-initiating with Fatal Bonds and Chaotic Offering, as Warlock can use the slow to greatly hinder enemy heroes' ability to escape while the golem attacks them. The enemy may choose to expend one of their disables to interrupt the channeling or choose to try to focus down Warlock while he is vulnerable, so make sure to position appropriately. Self-casting Shadow Word prior to channeling can also aid in survivability during Upheaval.<br/>In a pinch, Upheaval can be used to cover retreats, or for area denial. Casting the spell on an area that the enemy wants to traverse can give them pause, as walking into an active Upheaval will slow them down much more than if it was cast on top of them. This can be useful for giving teammates space to run away, or for preventing the enemy from entering an area that they wish to go (such as pushing up high ground into your base, or into/out of Roshan's pit).<br/>Beware, Upheaval is a percent-based movement speed slow, and as such can be ignored by certain abilities such as Stampede, Shukuchi, Surge, and so on. Be sure that you know what abilities the enemy has that can ignore Upheaval's debuff, and plan accordingly.<br/>Upheaval gets stronger over time, so it can be used preemptively before a teamfight if you have a low level in it.<h4></h4>Chaotic Offering<br/>[edit | edit source]<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Windranger is a very flexible hero who can be played in any lane, and who can perform many roles from support-disabler to DPS carry.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Good escape<br/>Great pusher<br/>Strong at any stage of the game<br/>High skill cap<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Farm and level dependent<br/>Low armor/spell resistance<br/>Single-target damage<br/>Requires good positioning<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>In general, Windranger should focus on either maximizing her potential in disabling enemies, or increasing her raw damage and upgrading her ultimate for physical DPS; it is not feasible to aim for both. The former may be done as a support or core, however the latter is only feasible if Windranger is given farm priority.<br/>Played as an off-laner, it is recommended to get Windrun as your first skill in order to give yourself survivability against the enemy's supports. You have decent last-hitting capability due to being a ranged hero with a low base attack time, and your escape skill can save you from ganks if used properly. Once you have enough levels, you can use Powershot to get last-hits from a safe range and to harass down the enemy heroes enough to give yourself a chance at a kill.<br/>As a mid, Windranger should purchase an early Null Talisman for more last-hitting power, and save up for a Bottle to give her mana for her spells. Survivability is less of an issue as the enemy's supports will have to rotate in order to gank you, so priority should be given to beating the enemy's mid and leveling up your nukes and disables so that you have a chance to get a kill.<br/>As a safe-lane support, Windranger can focus on harassing down the enemy's off-laner using her ranged attacks, and landing full-duration Shackleshots during ganks. Priority here is given to protecting the safe-lane carry and shutting down the enemy off-laner, so nukes and disables take priority.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shackleshot</h4>Shackleshot is potentially a very powerful stun depending on how well it is used. Aimed properly, it is possible to stun two enemy heroes for almost four seconds, giving your team a major opportunity to capitalize on.<br/>Positioning is very important when casting Shackleshot, both on yourself and the enemy. Even if shackling two enemy heroes together is not possible in a fight, tying one enemy hero to a tree or nearby creep still gives you a very long-duration disable. Always keep an eye out for possible latch targets, as Windranger has entire treelines to use when fights occur in either jungle.<br/>Shackleshot is very powerful when used in conjunction with any other leading disable. As smart enemies will deliberately attempt to avoid lining themselves up with creeps or trees to allow themselves to be shackled for the full duration, stopping them in their tracks first will give you much more time to re-position yourself around them and cast Shackleshot from an angle of your choosing.<br/>One important facet to keep in mind about Shackleshot is that you do not have to directly cast it on your target in order to disable them. If there are nearby enemy creeps, you can line up Shackleshot on them, and attempt to latch the enemy player as the spell's secondary target. This can be a very useful tactic if the enemy is deliberately attempting to avoid putting themselves between yourself and the treeline or nearby creeps.<br/>In concert to the above, Shackleshot is capable of latching enemies through Linken's Sphere in this way. By targeting the enemy player as the secondary target of Shackleshot, it is possible to stun them for the full duration regardless of their Linken's Sphere. You can then break the Linken's at your leisure during the stun duration using an expendable targeted ability such as Force Staff.<br/>While Shackleshot's mini-stun is very weak, don't forget that it is a mini-stun regardless. This makes it useful if you need a fast interrupting disable against enemies with powerful channeling spells such as Dismember, Death Ward, and so on.<br/>If there is no tree, secondary Hero or creeps near a Shackleshot target, you can still stun them long enough by using Shackleshot, then quickly use Blink Dagger and place Ironwood Branch behind them.<h4>Powershot</h4>Powershot is a potent damage nuke with an extremely long range. It is generally recommended to max it out first, as its long reach allows you to harass, last-hit, scout and kill from surprising ranges.<br/>Powershot's long range and nuking power makes it ideal for sniping fleeing enemy heroes, as well as hitting invisible enemies that you know the approximate location of. As well, keep in mind that you can hit multiple enemies with it at once, so it pays to line up your shots.<br/>Remember that Powershot grants vision over the arrow's travel path. Use this to your advantage to scout out areas ahead of moving in, such as checking if enemies are waiting behind a certain treeline to gank or if the enemy team is killing Roshan.<br/>Keep in mind, Powershot's long range allows Windranger to hit multiple jungle camps with a single cast if she lines it up properly. This allows her to farm surprisingly quickly in the jungle, or even use Powershot to draw aggro and stack more than one neutral camp at once.<h4>Windrun</h4>Windrun is a very flexible spell as it provides Windranger with both movement speed and evasion, allowing it to be used both defensively and offensively. If you expect to encounter ganks from the enemy team, one early level is usually wise.<br/>While the primary use for Windrun is as an escape spell against enemy ganks, it also has uses as an offensive spell. Used aggressively, Windrun allows you to chase down enemies and slow and body-block them for teammates to catch up, and ignore their physical attacks if they try to trade right-clicks with you. The bonus movement speed also allows easier positioning for Shackleshot and Powershot, but mind the mana cost and cooldowns so that you don't get caught short.<br/>If you are getting ganked and cannot outrun the enemy with Windrun, consider activating it once the enemy's disables have been used and then channeling a Town Portal Scroll for escape. The enemy will be unable to hit you with physical attacks, preventing them from killing you as you teleport.<br/>In a similar vein, Windrun combined with Healing Salve will prevent autoattacks from cancelling the salve for its duration, potentially allowing you to survive a tough situation early in lane.<br/>Depending on how much of a threat you are posing to the enemy team, they may buy a Monkey King Bar to counter you. The True Strike allows foes to ignore the evasion from Windrun, so be aware of that possibility if you are relying on Windrun to evade enemy attacks in teamfights.<h4>Focus Fire</h4>Focus Fire is a very potent spell that allows Windranger's physical damage to scale. It is useful to get at least one early level no matter what role she is played in.<br/>An early level of Focus Fire allows Windranger to deal tremendous damage to towers if left alone, as even with a 50% reduction in damage output it can triple her overall damage output due to the attack speed alone. If possible, try to bait out the enemy's Glyph of Fortification prior to casting Focus Fire on their tower, so that they cannot reduce the amount of damage your ultimate does to it.<br/>Unless you are building a DPS-focused Windranger, it is not recommended to target the enemy's main carry with Focus Fire at the start of a teamfight, as it is not guaranteed that you will be able to do so for the full duration of the spell. While you can use the spell to whittle down lone targets during ganks, it is most profitably used against enemy towers if you cannot guarantee that it will do enough damage to the enemy's carry in teamfights.<br/>Due to the amount of raw attack speed that Windranger gets from her ultimate, it may be wise to build attack modifiers with stable proc chances, so that you can proc them multiple times over the course of the ultimate. For instance, a Maelstrom has a 25% chance to proc on each attack and thus can deal a significant amount of magical damage in a short period of time, however a Skull Basher will go into cooldown for two seconds once it procs, preventing you from stun-locking a foe.<br/>If building Windranger for a DPS role, an Aghanim's Scepter is more or less mandatory, as it will remove the damage penalty on her attacks and reduce the cooldown such that she can have Focus Fire active constantly.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Winter Wyvern is a powerful nuker who also provides utility in her spells, making her a well-rounded support. As she does not require gold in order to be effective, she is well-suited to playing as a hard support, protecting her safe lane carry and rotating to gank with her spells.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Scales well into the late game<br/>Does not need items to do her job, and can focus on warding the map<br/>Is a decent pusher if you use your abilities right<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Falls off mid game when most damage is magic, but comes back online late game when physical carries start to come online<br/>Bad Winter's Curse usage can lose a winning team fight.<br/>Cold Embrace makes the ally unable to move, making them easy prey to magical nukers<br/>Bad movement speed<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Unlike most other intelligence-based casting supports, Winter Wyvern possesses respectable strength growth, making her quite resistant to damage. However, her poor base agility also means that she has low base armor, and can benefit greatly from purchasing items that provide her with bonus armor.<br/>Winter Wyvern has an extremely high cast range for all of her spells, allowing her to impact ganks and teamfights from the back lines without endangering herself. Purchasing mobility items allows her to position herself for casting her spells more easily.<br/>Keep in mind, Winter Wyvern has poor base movement speed and a very slow turn rate, making her quite sluggish; as well, she has a very short attack range and slow projectile speed, as well as poor base damage, making her physical attacks quite ineffective at harassing when not boosted by Arctic Burn. Good positioning and planning is necessary in order to make good use of Auroth's abilities, despite their extremely high cast range.<br/>Much of Winter Wyvern's damage output comes from her basic spells, which are costly and have very low cooldowns. Securing a reliable source of mana regeneration allows Winter Wyvern to keep on the move and enter teamfights ready to use her full arsenal at all times.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arctic Burn</h4>Arctic Burn gives Winter Wyvern flying movement while boosting her attack range and night vision, and causing her attacks to burn a fraction of enemies' current health every second.<br/>As it is her primary mobility spell, maxing out Arctic Burn first can help make Winter Wyvern far more mobile and better able to counter enemy actions. While the HP burn is static, reducing the cooldown and mana cost allows Winter Wyvern to have the spell ready as the situation requires, and helps keep her mana pool full for casting her other spells. As well, the increased slow can help to get kills during ganks, and can greatly inhibit enemy movement during teamfights.<br/>Arctic Burn is also a good spell pick as Winter Wyvern's first ability, as it can be used to initiate a fight by slowing and burning enemy heroes or as an emergency escape spell to evade an enemy gank.<br/>Because Arctic Burn's damage is expressed as a percentage of the target's current health, it is more effective the higher an enemy's health is. Using it at the start of a fight will burn down a larger fraction of the enemy's maximum health, allowing subsequent attacks and spells from teammates to be more impactful.<br/>Always take advantage of the flying movement that Arctic Burn provides. When initiating for a gank or teamfight, Winter Wyvern can soar over trees and ledges/cliffs, attacking the enemy from unexpected directions. When used as an escape, Auroth can escape enemies by flying over impassable terrain, preventing them from easily pursuing.<br/>Arctic Burn's combination of flying movement and attack and night vision range bonuses make Winter Wyvern into a very strong nighttime ganker. The increased night vision lets her spot enemies at very long range, allowing her to choose an advantageous approach angle with her flying movement, while the attack range bonus allows her to attack from outside most enemies' vision range, most importantly to put their Blink Dagger on cooldown for at least 8 seconds.<br/>Be careful about using Arctic Burn to scout, as Winter Wyvern still possesses ground vision and is unable to see up high ground or through trees. If going up high ground, try to take a side approach that takes her in from an unexpected angle (using trees for cover as necessary), rather than directly up a stairway where enemies could be waiting.<h4>Splinter Blast</h4>Splinter Blast fires a shard of ice at a target, splintering upon impact and damaging and slowing all other nearby enemies.<br/>Beware that Splinter Blast does not affect the primary target at all, and as such is useless against lone targets. If trying to damage and slow an enemy with the spell, aim it at a secondary target so that the splinters will bounce to the primary target.<br/>Because of its tremendous nuking potential, Splinter Blast can be a strong spell to max out early in the game. The combination of low cooldown and high area damage allows Winter Wyvern to sweep away creep waves in seconds and deal powerful area damage in fights. In particular, at maximum level Splinter Blast is capable of killing ranged lane creeps in a single cast before the 37:30 mark, giving her strong pushing and counter-pushing capability. Increasing Intelligence or buying Aether Lens can further strengthen her nuke damage and maintain her pushing potential.<br/>Splinter Blast's extremely long cast range allows Winter Wyvern to hit enemies up to 1700 range away. Use this to your advantage in fights to keep as much space between yourself and enemy heroes as possible.<br/>Be mindful that Splinter Blast's initial projectile has a fixed 1 second travel time beyond 650 range, and cannot be disjointed, so it is very adept at catching enemies no matter where they are. As well, the secondary splinters that damage and slow enemies in an area cannot be disjointed either once locked on, which allows Winter Wyvern to splash damage at enemies in many situations where other damage nukes cannot.<br/>Because of its extremely long range and low cooldown, Splinter Blast is a very useful spell for breaking an enemy's Linken's Sphere. In particular, it can clear the way to cast Winter's Curse, and come off cooldown shortly after the taunt.<br/>When casting Splinter Blast against lane creeps, keep in mind that the primary target will take no damage and will not be slowed. If creep positioning permits, try to target Splinter Blast on a siege creep, as their 80% magic resistance makes the secondary damage ineffective against them anyways. However, keep in mind that the siege creeps are usually positioned well behind the rest of a creep wave, meaning that unless the melee creeps are aggroed and brought closer, a Splinter Blast targeted on a siege creep will likely only hit the ranged creeps.<h4>Cold Embrace</h4>Cold Embrace is a powerful protective spell that disables a target ally but nullifies incoming physical damage and heals a sizable fraction of their health.<br/>Because it is a percentage-based spell, Cold Embrace is situationally effective in the early game when health pools are very small. However, the physical damage immunity means that a value point in the skill is very effective since it can be used to save allies who are ganked by enemies, particularly since most magic nukes will drain a sizable fraction of gankers' small mana pools.<br/>Cold Embrace's physical damage negation makes it extremely strong for saving a teammate who has been caught out of position and is being focused down by enemy attacks. The principle is that if an ally is being chain-disabled by the enemy, then casting Cold Embrace on them will not matter, as they were already being stunned and the spell will protect them from physical damage while healing them, wasting the enemy's time.<br/>Beware that while an encased ally is immune to physical damage, they are still affected by secondary attack effects, as well as Magical and Pure damage. This means that Essence Shift will still steal attributes, Mana Break will still destroy mana (but deal no damage), Chilling Touch and Arcane Orb will still deal their Magical and Pure damage components, respectively, and teammates can still be finished off by non-physical nukes like Laguna Blade and Sonic Wave. When choosing whether or not to cast Cold Embrace, be sure to take enemy composition and abilities into account.<br/>This vulnerability to other damage types can be mitigated with the help of allies, however. For instance, Repel can render the target spell immune and thus unable to be damaged by anything short of spell immunity piercing Pure damage, Fate's Edict can block magical damage while leaving the target still able to receive other buffs such as Purifying Flames, and so on.<br/> Cold Embrace is an extremely powerful pushing spell, due to its combination of healing, low cooldown and physical damage immunity.
<br/>Because of its percentage-based healing, Cold Embrace can restore a sizable fraction of allies' health, allowing them to continue pushing after a successful teamfight and be ready to engage enemies at full health.<br/>As it can be targeted on all allies, creeps can be targeted in order to render them immune to enemy attacks, particularly towers. Casting Cold Embrace on the creep that is currently being attacked by an enemy tower will waste the tower's attacks for the next 4 seconds, allowing all other allied creeps to continue damaging it.<h4>Winter's Curse</h4>Winter's Curse is an extremely powerful single-target spell that fully disables an enemy and applies a taunt to their nearby allies, causing them to attack the target while simultaneously boosting their attack speed.<br/>The greatest strength of Winter's Curse is that it allows Winter Wyvern to turn the enemy's power against themselves, forcing their farmed hard carries to use their powerful physical damage output against their own team. In particular, enemy auras and powerful damage and attack speed buffs (such as Inner Beast, Bloodlust and Empower) can cause then to connive in their own destruction by turning such abilities into liabilities should they ever clump up.<br/>Winter's Curse will lock down the target through spell immunity and cannot be removed by strong dispels, making it very powerful in many situations. If an enemy carry activates Black King Bar, Winter Wyvern can still disable them and force their allies to attack them, wasting the enemy's spell immunity while dealing damage to them.<br/>Remember that Winter's Curse cannot taunt enemies that are spell immune, so they will not attack their allies if they activate spell immunity prior to Winter's Curse. Depending on the situation, try to lock down the spell immune enemy over adjacent teammates.<br/>Target prioritization is key to using Winter's Curse; try to exploit its long cast range and use it on a key enemy that has powerful teamfight spells or powerful utility items. If possible, try to cast it on a squishy enemy who is standing next to their farmed hard carry, in order to increase the odds of getting a kill (additionally, it can also remove important teamfight spells and items from the field). Even if a kill cannot be secured, delaying a key enemy from participating in a fight for a short duration can make the difference between victory and defeat.<br/>Because of its quite long cooldown, try to avoid wasting Winter's Curse on lone targets. Save it for teamfights where it is most profitably cast, as not having the spell available can give the enemy an edge in engagements where they can fight without worry of being inflicted with the taunt.<br/>Keep in mind that all affected enemies will take no damage from Winter Wyvern or her team for the duration of Winter's Curse, so do not waste spells or attacks attempting to do so. Use Winter's Curse either to secure a kill, or set up the enemy in place while your team re-positions.<br/>Remember that the taunt will still be applied to anything passing through the radius after Winter's Curse is initially cast, whether nearby enemies or the disabled target itself. If the target is facing the right direction, try to use a Force Staff on them in order to push them within proximity of their allies and bring more units within the radius of the taunt.<br/> Many passive abilities do not work against allied units, so do not expect an enemy  to inflict  strikes on her teammates.
<br/>A short summary of the most common effects which do not trigger on allies: Most attack modifiers (critical strike, cleave and all active attack modifiers), Blade Mail, Spiked Carapace, Counter Helix and Corrosive Skin<br/>Short summary of effects which do react on allies: All damage block, all sources of damage negation and reduction, Reactive Armor, Return, Essence Shift, Cloak and Dagger, Headshot<br/>Winter's Curse also can be a good spell for allied heroes to land their spells which benefit by affecting as much enemy as possible, such as Black Hole, Death Ward (especially after upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter), Chakram and Blood Rite. Another mention is Great Cleave from Sven, while it doesn't deal any damage until the duration ends, Sven can use Storm Hammer after the curse duration ends, stunning multiple enemies in the proccess, allowing for easy kill with God's Strength, effectively decimating the entire team (if you manage to catch all team into the curse).<br/>Note though that in the case of spells like Dispersion or Bristleback, the reflected damage or passive quill sprays do not hit allies, but enemies still. The only exception is Centaur Warrunner's Return, which damages allies.<br/>All bashes excluding Spirit Breaker's Greater Bash and Slardar's Bash of the Deep works on allies. Examples: Berserker's Rage, Monkey King Bar, Skull Basher, Time Lock.<br/>Some item attack modifiers also work against allies. Examples: Desolator, Sange and Yasha, Eye of Skadi<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Witch Doctor is a strong support that scales well throughout the game. If well positioned can change the flow of battle with his ultimate.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Ultimate is very damaging with a short cooldown<br/>Maledict is very damaging<br/>Paralyzing cask can stun groups of enemies for long amounts of time<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dies very easily<br/>Ultimate can be disrupted by stun<br/>Maledict is hard to cast<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Witch Doctor is great with Blink Dagger for fast positioning as allows you to blink in between trees as well on top of cliffs to channel Death Ward safely. Also, it makes up for the short casting range of Maledict.<br/> It can be a good idea to build a  and use it exactly after casting . Activating  does not interrupt 's channeling and makes it harder for the enemy team to interrupt your channeling. However, be cautious about enemies buying Dust of Appearance, Gem of True Sight, Necronomicon, or AoE stuns such as Warlock's Chaotic Offering.
<br/>Alternatively you can save gold by simply buying the Shadow Amulet alone. During the 1.5 second fade time you are able to issue any orders without hindering the invisibility from occurring. This is easily achieved with the double tap to cast on self option. When you are ready to place the ward, double tap the hotkey for your amulet, as you are about to fade place the Death Ward. Soon after, you turn invisible while still channeling the spell. It is best to practice this technique with Maledict before attempting in a proper fight.<br/>Consider getting an Orchid Malevolence as it combined with Maledict can bring any damage done to the affected enemy to massive proportions.<br/>The Witch Doctor's early game damage and utility from Paralyzing Cask and Maledict are extremely strong in the laning phase. Consider skipping points in Voodoo Restoration until you reach level 10 to maximize lane pressure and damage output. Having Maledict at maximum level as soon as possible allows you to pull off shorter duration Death Wards to secure important kills.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Paralyzing Cask</h4>Paralyzing Cask can be used to continuously stun two heroes with 200 distance to each other.<br/>Paralyzing Cask is most effective when there are just two enemies close together. Under ideal conditions you can stun two enemies for up to 4 seconds each with this ability.<br/>Paralyzing Cask stuns jungle creeps for five seconds, allowing the Witch Doctor to jungle effectively from around level 7 onwards. This is especially useful if you are falling behind or need to speed up a key item such as your Black King Bar or Aghanim's Scepter.<br/>Paralyzing Cask stuns units in the fog of war, meaning if you use a high enough level Cask on foes nearby jungle camps, there is a good chance it will bounce back to your enemies.<h4>Voodoo Restoration</h4>At level 1, Voodoo Restoration is one of the most efficient AoE heals in the game based on mana-spent-per-hitpoints-gained. It is often a good idea to invest a single point into this ability during early laning and then max it later after your other abilities once you have the mana regen to support the higher cost.<br/>If there is a Rubick on the enemy team, keep in mind that you can cast Voodoo Restoration even while channeling, which prevents him from stealing death ward.<br/>If you plan to pick up an early level in Voodoo Restoration, it is often more effective to buy additional Clarity Potions instead of a set of Tangos or a Healing Salve.<h4>Maledict</h4>Casting Maledict on opponents often immediately forces them to retreat for fear of taking crippling damage while under its effects. You can use this to make enemies flee who would otherwise easily kill you or your allies. If they do not flee, then at best they're trading themselves for you.<br/>Maledict is a very weak and expensive spell at level 1, and its damage only starts to kick in once you get it to at least level 2 or 3. In very early game fights, do not worry about landing a level 1 Maledict unless you're sure you can curse multiple enemies or you have enough burst to follow up.<h4>Death Ward</h4>Casting Death Ward from a hidden position such as the trees, or uphill in the fog, makes it much harder to disrupt.<br/>Try to wait on casting Death Ward in teamfights until the enemies have already used some of their stuns, making it less likely you will be interrupted.<br/>Death Ward is an extremely effective spell against carries that typically rely on Magic Immunity to stay relevant in teamfights, such as Luna, Gyrocopter, Lifestealer, Sven, or Dragon Knight.<br/>Although Death Ward is easily interrupted, it is an effective zoning tool in teamfights that either draw immediate attention from foes with important crowd control spells or forces enemies to retreat from the area which the Death Ward resides in.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Zeus is an intelligence based hero played solely as a nuker. He has the highest magical damage output of any hero in the game and his strongest aspect is his early to mid game dominance as well as a extremely strong late game, even with minimal farm. If you play him correctly he can easily win games on his own.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Does a massive amount of magic damage<br/>Global Ult<br/>Strong midgame nukes<br/>Easy to play<br/>Can easily snowball<br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Not flexible<br/>Needs mana control<br/>Low mobility<br/>Useless if enemy have Magic Immunity<br/>Bad Attack Animation<h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>Zeus is a great hero. He can dominate lanes, take easy kills, deal massive damage and give vision to your team for easy ganks. He is not very item-dependent but can benefit greatly from them.<br/>Lightning Bolt has a ministun which allows you to cancel channels.<br/>If you ground target Lightning Bolt from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.<br/>If you think someone is just about to escape vision, you don't need to cast Lightning Bolt on the hero, just cast it on the ground right behind them.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arc Lightning</h4>In the laning phase Arc Lightning can substitute for your normal attack to get last hits due to its low cooldown and long range, helping you stay out of harm's way given that Zeus's own attack animation, damage and range is rather meager early on.<br/>Arc Lightning is a great tool for tower defense, because it draws aggro from a safe range and deals damage over every unit.<br/>Consider putting two points into Arc Lightning and then maxing your other abilities, as three hits of 85 damage leave the enemy ranged creep just one hero attack away from death, and you don't want to have to go forward to get that lasthit. With two ranks, your second cast will put the creep down to 100 hp, which only very few heroes can deny in a single attack.<h4>Lightning Bolt</h4>Always use Lightning Bolt before Arc Lightning so you may not lose your opponent in the fog.<br/>Always watch your positioning as Zeus and Arc Lightning have relatively long ranges, and Thundergod's Wrath has global range. Often, there is no reason to be up close in battle unless you are chasing down heroes; and Zeus' fragility compounds this.<br/>Remember that Lightning Bolt and Thundergod's Wrath provide True Sight. Do not be afraid to use your ultimate or cast Lightning Bolt where you think they may be if you believe an invisible enemy may be sneaking up on you or attempting to escape; if an enemy is invisible in a team fight make sure to cast Lightning Bolt before casting Thundergod's Wrath so that the granted True Sight allows your ultimate to damage the invisible target.<br/>Because Lightning Bolt offers 4.5 seconds of True Sight and flying vision, you can cast it on the ground near cliff-sides or other popular warding areas to check for wards or de-ward without actually purchasing sentry wards.<h4>Static Field</h4>Leveling Static Field increases your damage output by a great deal and scales very well into the lategame.<br/>During team fights, use all of Zeus's spells (including his ultimate) as soon as possible to make the best use of his passive, that it's based on the percentage of current health, not maximum health, so it will do more damage to heroes at full health. If you wait for the enemy team's health to go down before using Thundergod's Wrath, then Static Field will not do as much damage as it could have.<h4>Thundergod's Wrath</h4>When trying to kill low hp heroes (low, but not low enough for Ultimate only) in hard to navigate areas use Thundergod's Wrath to gain vision of your enemy so you can Lightning Bolt them to death.<br/>Considering the 25% magic resistance most heroes have by default, Thundergod's Wrath effectively deals 168.75/262.5/356.25 damage, provided they have no other source of magic damage reduction.<br/>Thundergod's Wrath can have a good synergy with Bloodseeker's Thirst, since it reveals any heroes that are at low health, so Zeus can simply ulti them to get a kill(s).<br/>Thundergod's Wrath should only be used to acquire a kill if your carry is unable to attain it himself. In most encounters, it should be used early in the fight to make things easier for one's team.<br/>Since magic damage doesn't scale well into late game as physical damage, combining it with allied spells like Soul Catcher, Bloodrage and Ancient Seal keeps him relevant for longer.<h2>Items</h2><br/><br/>
