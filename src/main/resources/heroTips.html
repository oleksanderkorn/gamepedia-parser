<body><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Abaddon is versatile hero who specializes in absorbing damage and shielding his teammates. Unlike other supports, Abaddon's Borrowed Time allows him to be in the middle of the fight, converting heavy attacks back into health. His Mist Coil Aphotic Shield makes it frustratingly hard for enemies to bring down his allies, and their low cooldowns can turn fights around at crucial moments. Curse of Avernus slows foes hit by your sword, giving them a hard time running from you and your allies (since you can hit them with no worries while your ultimate is off cooldown), at the same time increasing your allies attack speed and movement speed if they also hit the enemy. Although Abaddon's common build seldom allows him to do enough damage to kill enemies alone, he can still provide cheap nuke damage while played as support, and under favorable circumstances, he can also be played as a semi-carry.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very tanky support.<br/><br/>Low cooldowns.<br/><br/>Can fulfill multiple roles.<br/><br/>Has a built-in dispel.<br/><br/>Great support for beginners.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mobility.<br/><br/>Low starting armor.<br/><br/>Long cast animations.<br/><br/>Mana dependent.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Abaddon is renowned for his multipurpose spells capable of manipulating how much damage the enemy is able to deal to his team, and turn it against them. In this way, Abaddon is not only able to protect and heal his teammates, but also possesses offensive potential capable of dealing damage to enemies as well.<br/><br/>Abaddon's versatile skill set allows him to be played as either a carry or a support, depending on what his team needs. He is able to gear his skill build towards protecting teammates and shielding them from harm, or for more offensive purposes to give himself more damage output.<br/><br/>Beware that Abaddon has very long cast animations for Mist Coil and Aphotic Shield, requiring roughly 50% more time to cast his spells than most other heroes. Positioning and planning ahead are crucial for allowing Abaddon to get his spells off in time.<br/><br/>One of Abaddon's early weaknesses is his poor agility, resulting in low base armor (and thus vulnerability to physical damage despite being a strength hero) and poor attack speed (hampering his carry potential). Rectifying his armor weakness is crucial in order to make him effective in any role he plays, though improving his attack speed is dependent on if he is playing as a carry.<br/><br/>Depending on if he is being built as a support or carry, Abaddon has differing itemization priorities and skill builds.<br/>Abaddon is generally played as a safe lane support due to the vast survivability his skills provide for his team. His role in the safe lane is to control lane equilibrium through pulling creep waves, as his ability to harass the enemy off-laner is hampered by being a melee hero. He also stacks jungle camps for his carry to farm later, and acts as a babysitter capable of protecting his lane against enemy aggression with his powerful survivability spells. As a support he focuses on building mana items to allow him to continue casting his spells, and HP regen items to fuel the cost of Mist Coil, then utility items to give his team an advantage in fights. His skill build aims towards maxing out Aphotic Shield and Mist Coil first in order to maximize his early nuking power while also protecting his teammates.<br/><br/>As a carry, Abaddon must gear towards tankiness and damage output, forcing the enemy to treat him as a threat so that he can take advantage of his ultimate. A carry Abaddon is geared less towards casting but more towards damage output, prioritizing Mist Coil for nuking power and Curse of Avernus for attack speed. Unlike most carries that try to directly attack and kill the enemy, Abaddon's carry potential lies in forcing the enemy to engage him and wasting their nukes and disables on him, and then negating that damage with his ultimate.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Mist Coil</h4>Mist Coil's low cooldown allows it to be used multiple times in an engagement at all points of the game. It can be used as a heal in one cast, a damage nuke in another, and even cast to break Linken's Sphere on an enemy or Roshan.<br/><br/>Beware of overtaxing yourself when using this spell repeatedly. While its low mana cost and short cooldown allows Abaddon to almost always have this spell at the ready, getting too low in HP can prevent him from being effective in fights due to the danger of dying to enemy focus without Borrowed Time, or being forced to use his ultimate too early.<br/><br/>The health cost of Mist Coil is dealt as Pure damage, which allows it to interact with Abaddon's other spells.<br/>Because it is treated as damage by game mechanics, Mist Coil's damage is affected by both Aphotic Shield and Borrowed Time. Casting Mist Coil during an active Aphotic Shield prevents Abaddon from taking damage while simultaneously adding to its damage threshold, and can either proc Borrowed Time passively when falling below 400 HP or heal Abaddon if it is already active.<br/><br/>The self-damage from Mist Coil is also lethal, which allows Abaddon to commit suicide with the spell. Deliberately used in this manner, Abaddon can deny himself in the face of attacking enemies, preventing them from profiting from his death.<br/><br/><br/>During pushes, Abaddon can cast Mist Coil and/or Aphotic Shield on a currently tanking lane creep, to boost their survivability.<br/><br/>Use Mist Coil to secure last-hits at range.<br/><h4>Aphotic Shield</h4>Casting Aphotic Shield on an ally applies a strong dispel on them, removing stuns as well as all otherwise purgeable debuffs. This makes the spell extremely strong against long-duration disables such as Sacred Arrow, Fiend's Grip, Chaos Bolt and so on, as the disable can be immediately broken and the target allowed to act.<br/><br/>Aphotic Shield can be used as a farming and pushing spell, due to its area damage. Placing the shield on the leading creep in an attacking wave shields it from damage for a short time, and then inflicts area damage on the enemy creep wave once it bursts. Similarly, casting it on Abaddon while farming neutral camps allows him to deal nuke damage after shielding himself from their attacks.<br/><br/>Abaddon's Aphotic Shield can be used to harass enemy farm. By placing the shield on an allied creep with low hp, enemy heroes will be denied the last hit, otherwise suffer shield damage in the process. This allows easy creep denying after the shield bursts. Abaddon can also deny the creep himself to make the shield burst if the enemy hero doesn't do so. This can harass melee heroes and ranged heroes to a certain extent, making it a lot harder for them to farm.<br/><br/>Used as a counter-gank spell, Aphotic Shield has the power to completely turn situations around. Shielding a teammate who is being ganked stops them from taking damage (and can be further augmented by healing them with Mist Coil), forcing the enemy to commit additional time and attacks, and then turning that damage against them, effectively causing a double shift in HP of the shield's listed value. The damage from a bursting shield can potentially damage an enemy enough to bring them within kill range.<br/><br/>In the same vein, Aphotic Shield is a powerful tower-diving spell for finishing off weak enemies. Placing Aphotic Shield on an ally prevents them from taking damage from tower hits for a short time, and the shield bursting deals nuke damage to the enemy, usually enough to finish them off. As well, tower-diving allies do not need to stop to perform cast or attack animations in order for the shield to burst, allowing them to easily chase within range of the detonation.<br/><br/>Unlike most other sources of damage negation, Aphotic Shield blocks any damage that is taken (after reductions. This means that magic resistance and armor can increase Aphotic Shield's potency, as none of the shield's power is wasted on damage that is reduced by resistances (e.g., a 200 magic damage nuke on a target with 25% magic resistance deals 150 damage to the shield).<br/><br/>Casting Aphotic Shield upon the same target before its duration has ended automatically detonates the shield before reapplying another. Combining this tactic with its massive radius can help to increase your DPS in a teamfight or finish off enemies during a chase.<br/><h4>Curse of Avernus</h4>In practical terms, the short debuff duration of Curse of Avernus means that Abaddon must constantly focus on attacking an enemy in order to inflict them with the slow for more than a short period of time. Additionally, allies must coordinate with Abaddon in order to ensure that they can maintain the speed buffs through focusing on affected enemies, as the buff duration is only marginally longer than the debuff.<br/><br/>During the laning phase, Curse of Avernus can be a useful spell to get at least one level in, as the movement speed shift can allow Abaddon and his allies to gain a speed advantage over gank targets. This can also be used defensively, inflicting a ganking enemy with the debuff to prevent them from easily chasing allies.<br/><br/>Curse of Avernus can be a useful spell for farming, as it reduces neutral creeps' attack speed while boosting that of Abaddon, increasing his damage output while simultaneously reducing theirs to mitigate any damage dealt to Abaddon's HP pool.<br/><br/>In concert to the above, Abaddon can push creep waves surprisingly well through judicious use of Curse of Avernus. Inflicting the debuff on enemy creeps reduces their damage output while also boosting that of allied creeps, causing the creep wave to push towards the enemy base without needing to expend mana. The curse can also be inflicted on enemy buildings, particularly their towers, cutting down their attack interval while also increasing that of all creeps attacking them, accelerating the tower's destruction.<br/><br/>Abaddon benefits from building items that provide additional slows, as they stack linearly with that applied by Curse of Avernus. Further reducing the enemy's movement and attack speed can give Abaddon and his team a powerful mobility advantage.<br/><br/>Remember that while Curse of Avernus's debuff can be purged, it can also be applied through spell immunity. This allows Abaddon to inhibit the enemy's attempts to re-position and attack even if they activate spell immunity, which can give his team a crucial edge in fights.<br/><h4>Borrowed Time</h4>Borrowed Time is a good way to make the enemy to waste time and spells on Abaddon, as he can simply heal back up and force them to engage him all over again when their abilities are on cooldown. This is best exploited if Abaddon is already at full health, as the enemy then needs to expend resources to bring him to low health first, before proccing Borrowed Time.<br/><br/>Abaddon can tower-dive quite effectively in the early game combined with Borrowed Time, as he can simply ignore tower and creep damage in his pursuit, and then finish the foe off with his other spells. Remember that Mist Coil's self-damage is treated as a heal during Borrowed Time, allowing Abaddon to use it as a self-heal and nuke with only mana as its cost.<br/><br/>During Borrowed Time, Aphotic Shield does not proc any damage shielding, as any incoming damage is treated as a heal after reductions. Casting Aphotic Shield during Borrowed Time not only removes debuffs from Abaddon, but also leaves him with a fresh shield once it ends.<br/><br/>If the enemy attempts to avoid attacking Abaddon during Borrowed Time in an effort to prevent him from healing, Abaddon can force the issue by taking advantage of enemy area nukes and attracting the attention of the enemy's towers and creeps. Spells such as Macropyre, Midnight Pulse and March of the Machines can deal area damage outside of the casting hero's control, and can be used as sources of healing during Borrowed Time.<br/><br/>Abaddon retains the ability to cast Borrowed Time through any disables excluding Silence and Hex. This allows Abaddon to snap himself out of most enemy disables, including targeted channels like Dismember and Fiend's Grip and directly engage the enemy or cast his spells (for instance, to heal an ally with Mist Coil or protect them with Aphotic Shield). However, beware of persisting area disables such as Ice Path and Chronosphere, which can immediately disable Abaddon again after casting.<br/><br/>Beware that since the damage instance that procs Borrowed Time is not healed up, it is possible for Abaddon to die if an attack brings him from above 400 HP to death in a single instance, as Borrowed Time does not passively proc. In order to circumvent this, Borrowed Time can be manually cast before reaching the threshold, and with good timing can bait the enemy into healing Abaddon.<br/><br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Abaddon gains the ability to shield all nearby allies from harm during Borrowed Time, by giving them a damage resistance buff that redirects half of all damage they would otherwise take to Abaddon during his ultimate. Used at the right time, it can give teammates much more survivability by doubling their effective HP against all damage types for the duration of Borrowed Time, while forcing the enemy to heal Abaddon himself.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are important in order to keep Abaddon from being harassed out of the lane, particularly as he is a melee hero.<br/><br/>Clarity fuels Abaddon's powerful spells, giving him the mana to make or break engagements through manipulating the HP and damage taken by his allies.<br/><br/>Iron Branch are cheap and give Abaddon additional attributes. They can be built into a Magic Wand or Mekansm components, or simply sold for more inventory space.<br/><br/>Animal Courier is expected as support Abaddon is less item-dependent than others.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are important to get early on Abaddon, as he needs good positioning in order to make use of his spells. It also allows him to more easily chase down enemies with Curse of Avernus.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is important for giving Abaddon burst HP and mana regen whenever he needs it. Both can fuel his spell-casting and increase his longevity in fights, allowing him to accomplish more.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius provides Abaddon with more armor, bonus damage, and mana regen to fuel his spell-casting. The aura boosts his allies' survivability, further increasing his ability to protect them, and the item can be disassembled and both components recycled for later items once Abaddon's intelligence reaches the threshold where a basic Sage's Mask gives him better mana regen.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom allows Abaddon to apply a slow with his attacks, and stacks alongside Curse of Avernus. It can be a good item to build for an aggressive posture, in order to inflict a stronger slow on gank targets.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Tranquil Boots are very powerful on Abaddon, on top of being the cheapest boots upgrade available. The increased movement speed gives Abaddon better positioning, allowing him to get his spells off more easily. The additional armor gives him tankiness, increasing his effective HP against physical damage. The HP replenishment allows Abaddon to recoup the HP cost of Mist Coil, ensuring that he never puts himself at too much risk when casting the spell.<br/><br/>Magic Wand gives Abaddon increased attributes and much more burst HP and mana regen, giving him much more survivability and allowing him to use his spells even after running completely dry.<br/><br/>Mekansm gives Abaddon a powerful heal with which to protect his team, alongside Mist Coil. It also gives Abaddon more tankiness through the additional attributes and armor, making him harder to bring down.<br/><br/>Observer Ward are important to purchase regularly as a support. Providing map vision gives Abaddon and his team forewarning to engagements, allowing Abaddon to show up to keep the tide of fights in his team's favor.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important on all heroes. Abaddon's ability to turn ganks around and give his team a strong survivability advantage make him a strong hero to have present in any engagement.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a useful utility support item that synergizes with Abaddon's ability to protect and heal his team. The increased strength gives Abaddon more HP and base damage and the mana regen helps keep his mana pool filled. Urn charges can be used to heal teammates or damage enemies alongside Mist Coil, and can be used on Abaddon himself to recoup Mist Coil's HP cost.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots is a strong support item that allows Abaddon to replenish his teammates' mana as well as his own. Given the strong defensive power of Aphotic Shield, having the mana to cast it whenever it is needed can greatly benefit Abaddon's team.<br/><br/>Power Treads helps give a carry Abaddon more combat presence. The increased attack speed allows Abaddon to utilize his physical attacks more, and attribute switching can reduce the mana cost of Aphotic Shield, reduce the HP cost of Mist Coil, and give Abaddon more HP and base damage as needed.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a solid item on Abaddon, no matter what role he takes. Its aura grants armor, HP and mana replenishment, lifesteal, and bonus damage to Abaddon and all nearby allies, making it a powerful item to have present in any fight.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight gives Abaddon greatly increased magic resistance and HP regen, allowing him to shrug off magic nukes and vastly increasing his survivability. The active allows Abaddon to further protect his teammates through shielding them from the enemy's magic nukes for a short time, synergizing with Aphotic Shield.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a good all-around attribute item that gives Abaddon more HP, mana, armor, attack speed and damage, as well as an aura that he and his team can utilize for much longer due to Abaddon's tankiness.<br/><br/>Radiance is a strong carry item, as it greatly increases Abaddon's attack damage and gives him a burn aura that forces the enemy to engage him. The aura also inflicts a blind debuff on the enemy, causing them to miss attacks directed at any friendly units so long as Abaddon is nearby.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass greatly increases Abaddon's armor and attack speed, giving him physical survivability and increased damage output to allow him to carry effectively. The aura also greatly benefits teammates, and reduces enemy armor, allowing Abaddon and his team to deal more damage.<br/><br/>Necronomicon gives Abaddon powerful utility through being able to summon minions. The item grants Abaddon more strength and intelligence, giving him more HP, base damage and mana, while the summoned units can be used to push, contribute in fights, or provide True Sight once fully upgraded.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter extends the duration of Borrowed Time and allows Abaddon to shield his allies from damage. The reduced damage can also force the enemy to heal Abaddon as it is redirected to him during the ultimate.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque drastically improves Abaddon's HP, making him significantly harder to bring down. It also allows him to quickly replenish his HP outside of combat, making him a powerful threat if he is farmed enough.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides Abaddon with a single target hard-disable, making it a powerful support item. It gives Abaddon stats across the board and greatly improves his mana pool and mana regeneration, allowing him to make strong use of his spells.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves greatly boosts Abaddon's survivability and allows him to greatly support his team. The heal and mana replenishment are very powerful, and the self-dispel allows Abaddon to remove debuffs from himself that may be preventing him from participating effectively in teamfights. The aura is also very strong, giving Abaddon and his teammates enhanced survivability when they are at low health, giving Abaddon more time to save and protect them with his spells.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a strong support utility item, allowing Abaddon to cloak a teammate in invisibility and greatly boost their magic resistance. If needed, it can also be used to help one of Abaddon's teammates initiate invisibly on the enemy.<br/><br/>Solar Crest is a powerful support item that further enhances Abaddon's ability to protect his teammates. The armor and mana regen give Abaddon survivability and mana sustain, and the active allows Abaddon to either enhance a teammate's survivability against physical attacks, or induce an armor debuff and miss chance on a troublesome enemy to reduce their ability to fight.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness is a cheap lifesteal item that can give Abaddon tremendous attack speed in order to increase his damage output as a carry. The lifesteal allows Abaddon to maintain his HP while farming, and recover the HP cost of casting Mist Coil. Using the active in combat allows Abaddon to utilize his physical attacks to deal damage, while at the same time boosting his movement speed to better allow him to take advantage of Curse of Avernus. The increased damage vulnerability can be ignored in favor of Borrowed Time, which prevents the enemy from using it against him.<br/><br/>Blade Mail can be a powerful semi-carry item that fills in several of Abaddon's deficiencies. The bonus armor increases his tankiness, the bonus intelligence gives him more mana for casting spells, and the bonus damage increases his damage output for fighting and farming. The active can allow Abaddon to use his HP pool offensively during fights, discouraging the enemy from focusing him down when he does not have Borrowed Time activated.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a strong utility support item that helps Abaddon to get his spells off and protect his teammates further. The increased intelligence and HP regen give Abaddon a bigger mana pool and helps sustain his casting of Mist Coil, and re-positioning himself allows him to get within range to use his spells to protect his allies. As well, the active can also be used to help push escaping allies to safety if enemies are pursuing.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger greatly increases Abaddon's mobility, allowing him to engage the enemy more effectively during teamfights, position himself for casting his spells on his teammates, and chase enemies down as needed. Both Aphotic Shield and Borrowed Time can be used to prevent Blink Dagger's on-damage cooldown from proccing, allowing Abaddon to use it to blink whenever needed.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is a useful mid-game carry item to build. While the HP cost of the active cannot be converted into healing by Borrowed Time, Armlet provides many powerful carry bonuses, and Borrowed Time can still be activated once Abaddon's HP is low in order to quickly recover HP through enemy damage.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity increases Abaddon's support potential tremendously and is relatively cheap to build. The bonus intelligence and mana regen greatly improve Abaddon's ability to cast his spells to protect his team, and the bonus movement speed gives him better positioning ability as well as allowing him to get within range to use Curse of Avernus against enemies more easily. The active allows Abaddon to instantly disable an enemy from range, or can be used on himself to remove silences that may be preventing him from casting his spells or manually activating Borrowed Time.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos gives Abaddon greatly increased support potential while also making him more tanky. The huge intelligence boost greatly improves his ability to cast spells, while the bonus HP makes him harder to bring down in fights, as well as increasing the potency of Borrowed Time. The active allows Abaddon to greatly slow an enemy's movement speed from long range, allowing him to get within range to inflict them with Curse of Avernus to further debilitate their mobility.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard is a powerful utility item that benefits Abaddon both as a carry and a support. The damage block, increased HP and bonus armor make Abaddon much harder to bring down with physical damage, and the active gives all nearby allies enhanced damage block and armor, increasing their resistance to physical damage for a short duration.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd gives Abaddon increased tankiness and a strong active that helps him carry in teamfights. The increased strength and bonus evasion give Abaddon much more survivability against physical attacks, and the active allows him to disarm an enemy carry during a fight, preventing them from effectively contributing.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can be a necessary purchase on a carry Abaddon if the enemy has a large number of disables. While Abaddon can remove debuffs from himself with Aphotic Shield and Borrowed Time, spell immunity allows him to act continuously without the fear of being chain-disabled and rendered unable to participate in fights at all. The bonus strength and attack damage also increase his HP and damage output, giving him more carry potential.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb can be a very powerful utility support item that further allows Abaddon to keep his teammates alive. The item gives Abaddon increased armor for tankiness and mana and HP regen for self-sustain, allowing him to always be ready to participate in fights. Using the active on himself or a teammate discourages the enemy from casting single-target spells on them, as they can be turned back against the enemy; if Abaddon is not the target of the Echo Shell, he can also remove any disables placed on the targeted ally with Aphotic Shield, effectively using the enemy's disables against themselves with no effect on Abaddon's team.<br/><br/>Moon Shard greatly increases Abaddon's attack speed, giving him much more physical damage output, and increases his situational awareness at night. It can also be consumed in the late game to give Abaddon a permanent attack speed bonus and free up an inventory slot for other items.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is a strong item to build on Abaddon whether he is a support or carry. It greatly increases his armor and intelligence, increasing his tankiness and greatly improving his mana pool. The passive aura greatly reduces enemy attack speed, which can be stacked alongside Curse of Avernus, and the active ability allows him to inflict a damage nuke and slow enemy movement speed as well.<br/><br/>Silver Edge gives Abaddon offensive potential and a powerful active, increasing his carry potential. The item's attributes give him a great status bonus, attack speed and physical damage output, while the active can give him both initiation and escape ability, something he otherwise lacks. The active allows Abaddon to apply a break to an enemy during initiation at the same time as Curse of Avernus, negating their passives and reducing their overall damage output while simultaneously dealing backstab damage and applying Curse of Avernus to them.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is a very powerful carry item to build on Abaddon. It gives him stats across the board, improving his HP, mana, base damage, and attack speed, as well as giving him a powerful attack that can greatly slow any attacked enemy alongside Curse of Avernus.<br/><br/>Satanic is mainly strong on agility hard carries due to their high physical damage output and small HP pools, but can be very strong on carry Abaddon as well if he has built up enough physical damage output. The lifesteal and armor greatly increase his tankiness, alongside the bonus strength, which gives him HP and more damage to utilize the lifesteal. The active can be treated as a pocket version of Borrowed Time, allowing Abaddon to bring his HP back up to full in a matter of seconds using his damage output, drastically increasing his tankiness and forcing the enemy to work down his HP a third time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Alchemist is a formidable carry capable of amassing large amounts of gold, and sustaining himself almost indefinitely during teamfights. Armed with a Shadow Blade, Alchemist can also gank effectively by stunning enemies with Unstable Concoction. Because of the extra gold from his Greevil's Greed, Alchemist will always snowball into a potent fighter if a match goes long. Under Chemical Rage, a well-farmed Alchemist can demolish heroes and structures alike with alarmingly fast attack speed, all the while regenerating his health at incredible rates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Scales well into late game.<br/><br/>Good comeback potential.<br/><br/>Capable of farming gold quickly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly reliant on his ultimate.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/><br/>Worst stat growth in the game.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Alchemist is a fairly heavy carry, but may still have trouble dealing with other hard carries, such as Spectre.<br/><br/>Alchemist farms faster than any other hero, thank to his 3rd ability, Greevil's Greed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Acid Spray</h4>Use Acid Spray to farm in lane if your opponents are harassing you heavily.<br/><br/>Acid Spray is useful in farming creeps. Ask a support to stack camps for you.<br/>It is possible for Alchemist to farm ancient creeps safely early on with Acid Spray. Combined with Greevil's Greed, this can give Alchemist incredible amounts of gold over time. It is not uncommon to have expensive items like Radiance or Mjollnir by 14 minutes with this strategy.<br/><br/>Acid Spray can also be used to stack creeps from a distance. Using it on creeps will cause them to automatically pursue Alchemist, and therefore move away from the camp.<br/><br/><br/>Use Acid Spray to dissuade enemies from defending their towers, or pushing into yours.<br/><br/>If playing mid, use Acid Spray to push the wave before you pick up the rune every two minutes.<br/><h4>Unstable Concoction</h4>One point in Unstable Concoction is usually enough until other abilities have been leveled.<br/><br/>Smart opponents can make it difficult to land Unstable Concoction by juking and avoiding your vision, causing the backfire. It may be better to use it immediately when an enemy reaches the treeline, even if you lose damage and stun duration.<br/><br/>Enemies will attempt to disable Alchemist while Unstable Concoction is brewing, preventing him from throwing it and causing him to suffer a long stun in addition to the first enemy disable. Try to stay out of reach until you are ready to throw Unstable Concoction.<br/><br/>Fully brewed, Unstable Concoction is one of the most potent stuns in the game, in both damage and stun duration. The enemy is able to see your timer. It is imperative that you either start channeling within range, or channel a few seconds of the concoction from within fog before revealing yourself. This ability is most devastating to low armor heroes that almost take its full damage upon impact, especially if they are softened up by Acid Spray.<br/><br/>If you are in a tight spot and have no way to escape with low health, Unstable Concoction can be used to deny yourself.<br/><br/>It may not be a good idea to charge Unstable Concoction if you believe you are about to lose vision of an enemy (such as when chasing through trees), as you could end up stunning yourself.<br/><br/>Begin charging Unstable Concoction before using Shadow Blade or Silver Edge to take enemies by surprise.<br/><br/>Unstable Concoction can be used to deny yourself. If you find yourself in a sticky situation with Chemical Rage on cooldown and no means of escape, you can channel this spell in the hopes of denying yourself.<br/><h4>Greevil's Greed</h4>An early point significantly increases Alchemist's gold income.<br/>Putting your first skill point into it can gain you a 200 gold advantage if your team can secure the Bounty Rune on your side of the map. You may even be able to double it if you can get both Bounty Runes on your side of the map.<br/>If you are feeling particularly lucky or daring, you can try to steal the Bounty Runes on your opponent's end before claiming the runes on your side of the map.<br/><br/>Don't be to quick to learn this skill immediately when the match starts. You should invest the your first point into this skill only if you can guarantee that you will claim the rune, as if your teammates or opponents happen to steal it from you, you will be at a severe disadvantage during the early laning stages, as Alchemist's melee range, poor damage and attack speed makes it difficult for him to last-hit effectively.<br/><br/><br/><h4>Chemical Rage</h4>Chemical Rage disjoints projectiles, but can be difficult to time properly.<br/><br/>Feel free to use Chemical Rage for its healing effects; it even regenerates its own mana cost over the duration, and even more if you have percentage bonuses for mana regeneration from items like Sage's Mask or Perseverance.<br/><br/>When Chemical Rage is on cooldown, Alchemist is extremely squishy due to his poor strength gain and low armor.<br/><br/>Chemical Rage is the strongest single target DPS booster in the game (giving a 70% boost in DPS at level 3). This means that Alchemist scales very strongly with attack damage boosting items, however at the same time Alchemist does very little damage without such items. This means if Alchemist is going to contribute into team battles down the road, it is imperative to get yourself some attack damage.<br/><br/>It is important to understand that the Base Attack Time change of Chemical Rage does not alter the value of attack speed, neither up nor down. You still want to have a good mix of items that give attack speed and damage.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Tangoes and a Healing Salve, along with a Stout Shield allow Alchemist to take a bit of damage while going for last hits.<br/><br/>Iron Branches are very cheap and give small attribute bonuses.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give a nice movement speed boost.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives Alchemist's low starting armor a nice little boost.<br/><br/>Helm of Iron Will gives some armor and health regeneration. It builds into Armlet of Mordiggian.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Phase Boots gives a damage boost and the phase active works well with Chemical Rage movement speed bonus to chase opponents.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is useful on Alchemist because Chemical Rage health regeneration counters the item's health draining effect.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Boots of Travel allows Alchemist to split push lanes, and be present at while farming free lanes. Also, the movement speed boost greatly mitigates his weakness in mobility.<br/><br/>Battle Fury allows Alchemist to farm anything in no time, also you can farm it within 6 minutes with Battle Fury you can get Aghanim's Scepter for all your team.<br/><br/>Black King Bar allows Alchemist to be uninterrupted in his attacks.<br/><br/>Radiance is a good pickup since Alchemist can get it very quickly with Greevil's Greed, when the burn damage hurts the most. It can also deal heavy damage to the enemy team, as Alchemist can stay alive for prolonged periods with Chemical Rage.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass lowers enemies' armor, which stacks with the armor reduction from Acid Spray. It also provides a useful aura to the rest of your team.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering provides a useful aura and uses a Ring of Basilius as one of its components.<br/><br/>Blade Mail forces enemies to think twice about fighting back against Alchemist.<br/><br/>Manta Style is excellent for sieging buildings, and also provides Alchemist with a much needed disjoint mechanism.<br/><br/>Mjollnir increases Alchemist's attack speed greatly, and also gives a useful Static Charge to protect Alchemist or his teammates. Its lightning attack will also trigger often under Chemical Rage.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade goes well with Alchemist's high attack speed, and helps greatly in securing an enemy. It also gives bonus attack damage and greater survivability providing bonus HP and blocking damage from incoming attacks.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd gives some strength and evasion, and also gives the ability to disarm a threatening enemy.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives Alchemist a massive amount of health. Combined with the health regeneration from Chemical Rage, Alchemist is extremely hard to take down.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a valid alternative for Ring of Basilius, helping add both armor and mana regen, as well as increasing damage dealt by physical attacks and spells as well.<br/><br/>Solar Crest allows Alchemist to further reduce the armor of his enemies, makes it easier to fight them with his Ultimate, and allows him to further support allies.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade grants Alchemist invisibility to brew up his Unstable Concoction. He can break the invisibility by attacking the enemy for additional bonus damage and at the same time launch his concoction.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is a natural upgrade to Shadow Blade, and as such it should be purchased as an upgrade after Shadow Blade itself.<br/><br/>Moon Shard serves as a cheap, permanent upgrade to Alchemist without using any inventory slots.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Axe is a very strong initiator and disabler as he possesses an area disable capable of piercing spell immunity in Berserker's Call, and a low-cooldown slow in Battle Hunger that also boosts his movement speed. Given mobility and mana sustain, Axe is capable of wreaking havoc against enemies at all points of the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful ganker once he gets his Blink Dagger.<br/><br/>Very good at punishing melee heroes in lane.<br/><br/>Can farm lanes and the jungle very quickly.<br/><br/>Almost completely unaffected by spell immunity.<br/><br/>Very resistant to physical damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Damage output falls off in the late game.<br/><br/>Can have a hard time against ranged heroes in lane.<br/><br/>Small mana pool.<br/><br/>Countered by Nukers and Disablers.<br/><br/>If Axe sees a group of enemies, he should be very careful, as he needs to catch the entire group with his Berserker's Call, otherwise, the less enemies caught in Axe's trap, the more chances of dying he gets.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>The synergy between Berserker's Call and Counter Helix means that Axe is capable of dealing great amounts of pure damage during initiations, but must build for survivability to ensure he is not killed by enemy attacks during his initiations.<br/><br/>Axe's spells give him powerful harassment potential and survivability, allowing him to punish enemy lanes and gain an early advantage for his team. In order to transition well into the late game he requires farm, however his initiation and disabling abilities allow him to set up ganks and early teamfights to get the gold he needs to remain relevant.<br/><br/>As a melee initiator with strong survivability spells, Axe can be a very strong off-laner, or a powerful jungler.<br/>A combination of Berserker's Call and Counter Helix make Axe a good off-laner, as he can deal large amounts of damage with Counter Helix if the enemy dares to attack him at melee range. As well, he has the ability to force the enemy to attack him via Berserker's Call if he can get close enough, also using his enemy's lane creeps against them to increase the proc chance of Counter Helix.<br/><br/>Counter Helix allows Axe to be a strong jungler, as he can whittle down neutral camps without expending mana. Additionally, Axe's position in the jungle allows him to rotate mid to help set up ganks, or help to harass and gank the enemy's off-laner.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Berserker's Call</h4>Berserker's Call is a taunt that forces all enemies near Axe to attack him, while simultaneously boosting his armor to allow him to weather the enemy attacks.<br/><br/>Berserker's Call is Axe's prime initiating and disabling ability, as it cannot be blocked by spell immunity or Linken's Sphere. In order to utilize it to its utmost, Axe must possess strong mobility, namely Blink Dagger in order to instantly jump into the midst of the enemy to make the most of it.<br/><br/>Because of its short duration, Berserker's Call benefits greatly from assistance from allied area-of-effect disables. By taunting the enemy and forcing them to bunch up, Axe can open the enemy team up for follow-up disables such as Light Strike Array, Hoof Stomp, Black Hole, and so on. Conversely, Berserker's Call can also be assisted by allied setup, such as Vacuum and Reverse Polarity.<br/><br/>When chasing enemies that are trying to escape, Berserker's Call can be useful for holding them in place for Axe's teammates to catch up. Additionally, it can be useful for interrupting Town Portal Scrolls, as taunting the enemy will cause them to break the channeling and attack Axe, preventing them from escaping.<br/><br/>Beware that unlike Axe's other spells, Berserker's Call has a 0.4 cast animation. If possible, try to get as close to enemies as possible before taunting, or try to lead your blink so that they will run into the call's area as it is cast.<br/><br/>If a Blade Mail has been purchased, it is sometimes most optimal to activate it after Berserker's Call has ended, depending on targets. Activating it at the end of the duration will give Axe an extra 4.5 seconds of survivability, as enemy players will be further punished for targeting Axe with nukes and additional attacks once they are able to control their heroes. Additionally, it will buy time for Berserker's Call to come off cooldown to be cast again, as at max level it has a cooldown of only 10 seconds, meaning that Axe only has to survive for two more seconds after Blade Mail. Use it during Berserker's Call for additional burst damage, for instance if catching a hero in Berserker's Call that has high damage output but low health it can be used to completely eliminate the target during the duration of Berserker's Call.<br/><br/>Berserker's Call is capable of taunting invisible enemies. One useful way to bring enemies out of invisibility is to try to cast it if they are near Axe; this will force the enemy to attack him, bringing them out of invisibility. This can be useful for interrupting abilities like Meld, or interrupting an enemy that is channeling while under the effects of Glimmer Cape.<br/><br/>Axe does not need to stand in place once he has successfully taunted the enemy. If he catches enemy melee heroes, it is possible for Axe to kite them away from an escape path, as they will follow him during the taunt to try to attack him. Forcibly displacing the enemy during Berserker's Call can make a huge difference depending on the terrain and allied and enemy positioning.<br/><br/>Remember that Axe gets the bonus armor no matter if he manages to successfully taunt any enemies. If he is low on health and is trying to escape, Berserker's Call can be used simply to increase Axe's armor so that the enemy's physical attacks cannot kill him before he reaches safety.<br/><br/>When initiating for your team, it is usually a good idea to try to target the enemy's support heroes. Not only can this prevent them from casting powerful teamfight spells, but they also tend to have low HP and armor, causing them to take much more damage from Counter Helix, and possibly putting them within Culling Blade range to remove them from the field before they can contribute at all.<br/><br/>At maximum level, Berserker's Call is capable of disabling enemies for 3.2 seconds. If escape is necessary, Axe can attempt to taunt enemies and then immediately channel Town Portal Scroll, as he can escape during the taunt when the enemy is unable to cast stuns on him.<br/><br/>Use Berserker's Call to taunt and reveal invisible enemies if you are certain they are nearby.<br/><br/>Berserker's Call bonus armor makes Axe nearly immune to physical damage for a short duration, which can be used to neutralize physical nukes such as Omnislash and Unstable Concoction.<br/><h4>Battle Hunger</h4>Battle Hunger inflicts the target enemy with a damage and slow debuff that lasts until they kill a unit.<br/><br/>Battle Hunger can be a powerful harassing spell in the laning stage due to its long cast range and removal requirements.<br/><br/>By casting the debuff on the enemy and then going aggressive on the lane, the enemy can be forced to retreat away from the creep wave, preventing them from killing a unit to remove the debuff. Repeated over time, this can wear down the enemy's HP and force them out of the lane altogether.<br/><br/>Inflicting the enemy with Battle Hunger can also set up for kills if the enemy attempts to continue to lane to remove the debuff. Because the debuff slows the enemy's movement speed, casting Battle Hunger on them prior to allied initiation can slow their movement, greatly reducing their chances of escaping.<br/><br/>In order to make the most of this spell in-lane, try to time its casting with the enemy's attempts to last-hit. Inflicting the enemy with Battle Hunger while all creeps in the lane are near full health can force them to take more damage as no opportunities to kill a unit to remove the debuff will present itself soon. As well, casting Battle Hunger on them right after they last-hit the last friendly creep in the wave will give them no targets to kill (provided their own creeps are outside of deny range), making the spell run its full course. Axe can further debilitate the enemy by last-hitting and denying as much as possible to prevent the enemy from killing any units.<br/><br/>Casting Battle Hunger on the enemy when they have no creeps can be a great way to harass them. As they must retreat back to their tower to avoid tanking creep attacks, they will be too busy backing away to remove the debuff, and become vulnerable to tower-diving once your creeps reach the enemy tower.<br/><br/>Remember that Battle Hunger also increases Axe's movement speed while the enemy is affected by it, on top of slowing them down. This allows Axe to quickly close the distance to fleeing enemies and catch them with Berserker's Call.<br/><br/>Battle Hunger's long cast range allows Axe to use it as a finishing spell on a fleeing enemy who is at low health. In most situations there will be no opportunities for the enemy to remove the debuff from themselves, which can allow the spell to burn them down and kill them after the fact.<br/><br/>There is no requirement that Battle Hunger must be cast on an enemy hero. If mobility is a priority and a fleeing enemy hero is out of range, Battle Hunger can be cast on enemy creeps in order to boost Axe's movement speed, allowing him to then get within range to cast Battle Hunger a second time on the enemy hero.<br/><h4>Counter Helix</h4>Counter Helix allows Axe to deal pure damage in an arc around himself every time the enemy lands an attack on him, even if he is disabled.<br/><br/>Counter Helix syngerizes extremely well with Berserker's Call, as Axe can deal spin damage to enemies that he successfully taunts. If he catches multiple enemy heroes and creeps, Axe can deal a surprising amount of damage during the taunt, wearing them down for his team.<br/><br/>Counter Helix will only proc if an enemy lands a successful attack on Axe. This means that evasion and ethereal on Axe, or blind and disarm on the enemy, can prevent Counter Helix from proccing.<br/><br/>Because pure damage is completely unaffected by armor and magic resistance, Counter Helix makes Axe still deal a decent amount of damage in the late game, as most enemies can do nothing against its damage besides avoid getting hit. It also pierces spell immunity, making Axe a decent counter to Black King Bar.<br/><br/>The pure damage is also very strong against some naturally tanky heroes like Ogre Magi and Terrorblade (have very high armor), or Meepo and Viper (have higher magic resistance).<br/><br/>Counter Helix allows Axe to quickly farm creeps, whether they are lane creeps or neutral camps, since their attacks will greatly increase its proc chance. This can also be used to harass lane opponents, particularly if they are melee, since Axe can threaten them with great amounts of damage if he manages to get close.<br/><br/>In-lane, Axe can draw lane creep aggro by ordering an attack on an enemy hero while standing within 500 range of enemy creeps. This will draw the creeps to attack Axe, causing them to proc Counter Helix and allowing him to make quick work of the wave, pushing it towards the enemy.<br/><br/>In order to punish weak lanes, Axe can cut creep waves with Counter Helix: get behind the enemy tower, intercept the enemy's creep wave, and destroy it with Counter Helix, forcing the enemy to tank your creeps under his tower, which will also make last-hitting harder while also exposing them to tower dives. However, enemy rotations can punish such tactics since Axe will be in an exposed location while creep-cutting, far from assistance and easy to kill.<br/><br/>If you have successfully purchased Tranquil Boots and are jungling with Counter Helix, one tactic to conserve HP is to drop the Tranquil Boots on the ground before farming the neutral camp. This will prevent the Tranquil Boots from breaking, allowing Axe to pick them up to immediately start replenishing his HP. However, be very wary of enemy heroes encountering Axe while he is jungling, as they can pick up or destroy his Tranquil Bootswhile they are on the ground.<br/><h4>Culling Blade</h4>Culling Blade allows Axe to immediately kill an enemy if they are at low health, going through spell immunity and any other survivability buffs (including Shallow Grave and Borrowed Time), while simultaneously boosting the attack and movement speed of all nearby allies.<br/><br/>Effectively, Culling Blade allows Axe to reduce the maximum HP of enemy heroes by the threshold amount, as crossing below that threshold allows Axe to instantly kill them; as a lethal Culling Blade deals its damage as HP Removal, there is no way to increase or decrease this amount. It is important to know where these thresholds are in order to make the most efficient use of Culling Blade, however it is also important not to cast it too early, as failing a cull will put the ability on cooldown, preventing it from being used for the rest of the fight.<br/><br/>Culling Blade will always credit Axe with the kill, giving him the most gold for the kill. This can allow Axe to quickly get the gold for the items he needs, however it can also deny gold to your team's carries and stunt their item progression. If possible, try to use Culling Blade only as a last resort to secure a kill, or to prevent an enemy from participating further in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Culling Blade can be blocked by Linken's Sphere even if the enemy is below the kill threshold. Casting Battle Hunger on the target first can break the Linken's Sphere, allowing Axe to finish the target off.<br/><br/>Culling Blade will reset its cooldown if Axe successfully kills an enemy hero with the spell. This means that if removing enemies from the battlefield is a priority, Culling Blade is capable of eliminating multiple enemies in a span of seconds if he can get them low enough. However, keep in mind that Culling Blade is Axe's most mana-costly ability, so try to conserve enough mana during initiations to meet the demand if needed.<br/><br/>The speed boost gained from a successful Culling Blade can give Axe's team a powerful mobility advantage. Try to get a successful cull as early as possible in a teamfight, as the boost can make a great difference.<br/><br/>An Aghanim's Scepter-boosted Culling Blade not only increases in threshold and buff duration, but also drastically reduces the cooldown. One way to exploit this mechanic is to cast Culling Blade on an expendable enemy unit at the start of a fight; this will provide the speed boost at the start of an engagement, and the spell will come off cooldown by the time a cull opportunity on an enemy hero arises.<br/><br/>Using the console or config files, binding "toggle" and "dota_health_per_vertical_marker" to an unused key can be useful for providing a visual indicator by shifting the vertical markers for HP bars depending on the level of Culling Blade. These visual indicators can show exactly where the thresholds for Culling Blade are, ensuring that the spell can be used at the first possible opportunity. For instance, bind "P" "toggle dota_health_per_vertical_marker 250 325 400 550" will cause the 'P' key to cycle through the listed values.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango gives Axe health regeneration in the laning stage, allowing him to survive against most forms of enemy harass.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is crucial on a melee hero like Axe, as the damage block drastically increases his survivability against attacks, whether they be from enemy heroes or neutral creeps.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection gives Axe additional armor, further increasing his survivability against physical damage. It also allows Axe to build Tranquil Boots from the Side Lane Shop, boosting his efficiency.<br/><br/>Iron Branch is a cheap item that allows Axe to shore up his attributes with his remaining gold. It can be sold for inventory space as needed, or built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Tranquil Boots provide Axe with movement speed, armor, and passive HP regen outside of combat. It is crucial to get on Axe early for increasing his mobility for early initiations, giving him more armor for even more physical survivabliity, and providing a source of HP regen to allow him to remain on the field instead of returning to base.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is a powerful upgrade to Magic Stick, giving Axe additional attributes while also providing burst HP and mana regen, further increasing his ability to initiate and disable enemies with his spells.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can be a useful early-game item to build on high HP heroes with heavy mana costs like Axe. Having on-demand burst mana can allow him to cast his spells when needed, and he can easily recoup the HP cost with Tranquil Boots. The item itself also provides some passive mana regen and some HP regen as well to increase Axe's self-sustain.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good ganking item that gives Axe many benefits. The extra strength increases Axe's HP and base damage, and the passive mana regen helps with his mana problems. Urn charges can be used to add extra Pure damage to fights and ganks, or to heal Axe back up from any damage he incurs during Berserker's Call.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Blink Dagger is the most important purchase Axe must make if he is to become an effective initiator. Jumping on top of the enemy in order to disable them with Berserker's Call allows Axe to paralyze multiple enemies at once for his team to follow up on.<br/><br/>Vanguard gives Axe even more survivability against physical damage by giving him increased damage block, more HP and HP regen. The damage block is particularly strong for mitigating the damage Axe takes during Berserker's Call, allowing him to proc more instances of Counter Helix.<br/><br/>Blade Mail provides many strong benefits for Axe. The additional armor increases his durability, the intelligence boosts his mana pool to allow him to cast spells more often, and the attack damage lets him farm more easily and deal more damage to the enemy with his attacks. The active, used during or after Berserker's Call, further punishes the enemy for attacking him, allowing him to use his HP offensively to deal damage to the enemy during initiations.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is necessary for allowing Axe to be present at teamfights and ganks. His powers as an initiator can set up fights decisively in his team's favor.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Heart of Tarrasque greatly increases Axe's health and provides base damage, giving him much more power as an initiator, since he can continue disabling the enemy during fights so long as he is alive. As well, if he manages to survive fights and escape, he can quickly regenerate his HP and jump straight back into battle.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard drastically boosts Axe's intelligence and armor, giving him yet more survivability against physical damage while also eliminating his mana problems. The attack speed slow aura can greatly hinder the enemy from making physical attacks during fights, while the active can be used as a damage nuke and a slow to hinder their mobility.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives Axe stats across the board, providing tankiness and more mana. Its upgrade improves Culling Blade's kill threshold, allowing Axe to remove enemies from the battlefield much earlier, and reduces its cooldown to allow the spell to be used tactically.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel gives Axe additional battlefield and global mobility. The global teleport allows Axe to show up to fights to initiate for his team more easily, while the increased movement speed allows him to be more mobile on the battlefield, chasing enemies down and inflicting them with Battle Hunger to slow them.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is a strong teamfight item that greatly increases Axe's armor and attack speed. The armor provides yet more resistance against physical damage, and the attack speed allows Axe to become much more threatening with his right-clicks. The allied armor and attack speed aura is a strong edge in teamfights.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a strong survivability and utility item that can help Axe if the enemy's physical damage output is more than he can handle. The additional strength and evasion give him more health and survivability against physical attacks, respectively, and the active disarm allows Axe to completely stop an enemy from attacking.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is a strong purchase on Axe given his role as a close-range initiator. The item gives him greatly increased attack speed, making his physical attacks much more dangerous, and allows him to bounce Chain Lightning procs during fights to deal magical damage all around to the enemy. The Static Charge active can also be placed on Axe himself right before initiation, further punishing the enemy for attacking him during Berserker's Call.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard, upgraded from Vanguard, is a strong utility item that provides Axe with even more survivability against physical damage. The extra armor and attributes on top of the existing damage block and bonus HP can make him extremely tanky, and he can augment it even more and protect his allies with the active.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb is a strong initiator item that allows Axe to punish enemies for targeting him with disables. The item provides armor and more regen, making him more tanky and allowing him to replenish his mana over time. The active, used during an initiation, can punish enemies who target Axe with single-target disables and nukes, disabling and nuking them in turn to cause more chaos for Axe's team to capitalize on.<br/><br/>Bottle can be a useful purchase on Axe as an off-laner. It gives Axe the ability to replenish his HP and mana to survive harass, and can be replenished by taking runes. Once Axe has his Blink Dagger and begins roaming for kills, he can further keep his HP and mana up by picking up runes as they spawn, and use the runes themselves to further give him advantages during ganks and fights.<br/><br/>Force Staff gives Axe many strong benefits and is a powerful utility item to carry. The increased intelligence gives Axe a larger mana pool, while the passive HP regen helps to keep Axe's health topped up. The active can give Axe additional mobility, or can be used on teammates to help them initiate or escape. As well, using the active on himself after a successful Blink-Call can allow Axe to quickly kite enemies away, forcing them to follow him during the taunt.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a good survivability and self-sustain item. The armor aura helps increase Axe's survivability against physical damage, while the lifesteal, HP regen and flat mana regen aura can keep his mana up and allow him to sustain his HP while farming. All these benefits confer to nearby allies as well, making it a strong teamfight item as well.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can be a necessary purchase if he is facing a very disable-heavy lineup. Because he jumps right into the middle of the enemy to initiate, he is a prime target for focusing down with magic nukes and stuns, so having spell immunity can allow him to do more in fights.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Beastmaster is a utility hero that brings many benefits to his team, such as clearing trees with Wild Axes. His scouting Hawk functions like a moving ward, and his Boar slows down enemies with ranged attacks. Inner Beast speeds up allied attacks, and Primal Roar is the best single-target stun in the game. That said, Beastmaster does not excel at any one particular role and is usually played as a semi-support or initiator. His summons require a modest amount of micromanagement, which can be intimidating to new players. Beastmaster can pick off supports with ease, but cannot go head-to-head against heavier heroes. Depending on the situation, players can build Beastmaster as an initiator, pusher, or an armor/strength based brawler.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Large scouting vision with Hawk.<br/><br/>Long duration stun that goes through Spell Immunity.<br/><br/>Good at Pushing.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low damage.<br/><br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/><br/>Requires some micromanagement.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Beastmaster is usually played solo in the offlane, but also sometimes in the mid lane.<br/><br/>Some enemy setups can shut down Beastmaster in lane. If needed, ask a support to join you.<br/><br/>Micromanaging Beastmaster's summons, especially his Hawk, is important to winning games.<br/><br/>Compared to other supports, Beastmaster is fairly tanky.<br/><br/>Beastmaster has no escape mechanisms. Engage carefully.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Wild Axes</h4>Wild Axes has a very long range, and can be used to pick off fleeing enemies.<br/><br/>Wild Axes is good against juking enemies, as it cuts down trees over a wide area.<br/><br/>Wild Axes is a powerful farming tool, clearing waves of creeps at once.<br/>Aside from farming, Wild Axes is not very useful compared to Beastmaster's other abilities, and is usually maxed last.<br/><br/><br/>Use Wild Axes to stop an enemy from regenerating with Clarity or Healing Salve.<br/><br/>Wild Axes can be used to stack/farm ancient creeps, since they affect spell immune units. This can be very effective when used in Dire offlane (bottom), as Beastmaster doesn't need to leave the lane to hit the creep camp.<br/><br/>Be careful not to undercast Wild Axes. Always target the space behind the enemy.<br/><br/>Wild Axes can be used to cut down trees next to lanes. This gives better vision and could save Beastmaster from a gank.<br/><h4>Call of the Wild: Hawk</h4>The Hawk is Beastmaster's greatest asset, as it provides a large vision advantage for his team. It is usually leveled first.<br/><br/>Because of its low cooldown, there should always be a Hawk somewhere on the map, if not two.<br/><br/>Send a Hawk to scout ahead before a potential engagement. Even if it dies, it's well worth the sacrifice.<br/>Keep in mind that the Hawk cannot see enemies under Smoke of Deceit.<br/><br/><br/>Move and place Hawks over trees. This makes them harder to detect or kill.<br/><br/>If an enemy has spotted a scouting Hawk, and there are no impassable terrain nearby, immediately stopping the Hawk's movement may give it enough time to stealth before being killed.<br/><br/>Don't move Hawks too often, or they will be seen.<br/><br/>Hawks are good at scouting areas where wards are seldomly placed, like the forested edges of the map.<br/><br/>Most players will instinctively try to kill a Hawk. If seen, move the Hawk to bait enemies into favorable positions.<br/><br/>Hawks can be used as a target unit for Boots of Travel. Strategic placement will allow teammates to teleport to it for split pushing or ganking.<br/><h4>Call of the Wild: Boar</h4>Because of its low cooldown, Beastmaster can have two active Boars at the same time.<br/><br/>Assign control groups to Boars for easier microing.<br/><br/>In teamfights, target enemy carries with Boars to slow them down, making it easier for teammates to kite them.<br/><br/>Boars can be used to stack creeps for your team.<br/><br/>Boars can be used to block camps against the enemy team.<br/><br/>Target Boars on a pursuing enemies to slow them down.<br/><br/>With very good timing, Boars can be used to deny Beastmaster (or any other ally/building).<br/><br/>Hawks and boars give considerable experience when killed. In the laning phase, they will quickly give a level advantage to your opponent if they keep killing one or the other. Do not let that happen. Don't forget you can at least deny your boars once they're low on hp, but you should rather send them safely behind your tower and wait for them to time out.<br/><h4>Inner Beast</h4>Inner Beast is an excellent passive for pushing. With several teammates nearby, buildings will fall very quickly.<br/><br/>Inner Beast synergizes well with Boars, creeps, as well as units from Necronomicon. This gives Beastmaster significant pushing ability.<br/><br/>After the early game, Beastmaster should try to stay near allied carries so they benefit from Inner Beast.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Stout Shield allows you to take more harassment in lane.<br/><br/>Clarity, Healing Salve, and Tango allow you to stay longer in lane without having to return to the fountain.<br/><br/>Iron Branch is a very cheap item that provides a bit of attributes.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade is sometimes picked up to aid in last hitting.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early:</b><br/>Iron Talon is a viable choice if you started by jungling, or the offlane is too hard for you to survive.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a strong pickup on almost all heroes.<br/><br/>Bracer tanks you up and potentially uses one of your starting gauntlets.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives some good starting armor and mana regeneration in lane. The additional armor given to the creeps while activated can push the lane faster.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Boots of Speed offers additional movement speed. Since in early and mid game Beastmaster's summons deals more damage than himself, you can leave Boots of Speed as it is and build up Boots of Travel later.<br/><br/>Necronomicon has natural synergy with Inner Beast and is a great item to quickly take towers and add additional damage to target hit by Primal Roar, draining their mana and making the enemy hard to retaliate after.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Blink Dagger allows Beastmaster to engage on slippery targets that would not normally allow you to get into range to cast your ultimate.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage gives additional armor and mana regen. Together with Inner Beast and summons you can bring down Roshan in early game. Can be upgraded into a Solar Crest later.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance provides health, gives you much needed mana, and increases your ability to get in range to use Primal Roar on enemies. It also further increases the attack speed of your Boar.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering synergizes well with Inner Beast, since it boost your teams's damage as well as survivability. Also, Beastmaster is able to stay outside of base thanks to the lifesteal.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass stacks with his abilities and is a great pickup in general.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter further increases the power of your ultimate, giving it extreme range and a cooldown low enough to use it twice in protracted engagements.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is another strong aura item for your team and helps with pushing. It counters team with strong magical damage lineup.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque makes you extremely tanky, but be wary of getting it too early as you have less utility than with other item choices.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a strong utility item to disarm an enemy carry in teamfights. It will also give some extra health and evasion.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb allows you to use Primal Roar two times in quick succession. It will also allow you to summon an extra boar and hawk.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel can be bought in the late game. It is especially powerful when teleporting to the Hawk to kill lone target.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Brewmaster is an unpredictable brawler who sows disarray among enemy formations. With the help of a Blink Dagger, he jumps in to initiate with Thunder Clap, then divides into three elemental beings with Primal Split. He lands critical hits and dodges at random due to Drunken Brawler, dealing significant damage. Brewmaster is fairly tanky, and difficult to kill when he splits apart with his ultimate. However, he does not excel at any one purpose, and should be considered a hybrid between initiator, brawler, and tank.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High survivability with ultimate.<br/><br/>Numerous disables when in ultimate form.<br/><br/>Counters carries.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Requires fast micromanagement.<br/><br/>No mobility skills.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Brewmaster is usually played solo in the off-lane, although he can also work as a mid hero.<br/><br/>With his numerous disables during Primal Split, and the blind from Drunken Haze, Brewmaster is effective in shutting down physical damage carries.<br/><br/>When playing Brewmaster, try to gain an advantage for your team early before anybody on the enemy team, particularly the carry, can build a Black King Bar, as his disables cannot penetrate spell immunity.<br/><br/>If Brewmaster is being played more in the semi-carry role, consider using his ultimate as a life saver to keep yourself in the fight when you would normally die. The utility of the summoned spirits works excellently for finishing off opponents as well as initiation.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Thunder Clap</h4>Thunder Clap is extremely strong at the early stages of the game, acting as his area-of-effect soft disable. It is generally leveled up first due to its quite high damage.<br/><br/>Blink next to an enemy and use Thunder Clap as an initiation ability, as it will slow their movement.<br/>Keep in mind that sometimes there will not be time to use Thunder Clap during an initiation, as the cast time will allow enemies to disable Brewmaster. In these cases, it is better to use Primal Split right away.<br/><br/><h4>Drunken Haze</h4>Use Drunken Haze first on enemy carries to render them blind and useless.<br/><br/>Drunken Haze is usually not important in the early game, and can be leveled last.<br/><br/>Drunken Haze is a deceptively powerful debuff spell. Costing only 25 mana, it is capable of slowing and blinding an opponent for 4 seconds. With a cooldown of 5 seconds at maximum level, Brewmaster is able to inhibit an opponent's movement and attack almost indefinitely.<br/><br/>Drunken Haze is a very useful spell to negate the protective barrier of a Linken's Sphere carrier.<br/><h4>Drunken Brawler</h4>Drunken Brawler's ability icon changes color when a crit is ready. Use this knowledge to deal burst damage after initiating with Thunder Clap.<br/><br/>The guaranteed critical and evasion triggers are separate from each other.<br/><h4>Primal Split</h4>Splits Brewmaster into three units: Earth, Storm, and Fire.<br/>When Primal Split ends, Brewmaster reappears at one of the three units' locations, in this order: Earth -> Storm -> Fire.<br/><br/>If all three units die, Brewmaster dies.<br/><br/><br/>Use tab to quickly cycle through each unit and use their disables on as many enemies as possible.<br/><br/>Use Primal Split sparingly, as it has an extremely long cooldown. Try to avoid using it to run away if at all possible.<br/><br/>Queue Blink Dagger right before Primal Split ends to immediately blink to safety. This is useful if Brewmaster had low health prior to using Primal Split.<br/><br/>All auras Brewmaster has are bestowed around the spirits during Primal Split in this order: Earth, if Earth is dead, Storm, if Storm is also dead, Fire. The usual ones built on Brewmaster are Vladmir's Offering and/or Drum of Endurance. Shiva's Guard, Assault Cuirass and Guardian Greaves should also be considered.<br/>A special mention goes to Radiance, which considerably increases Earth's damage output, while putting Brewmaster at little risk so long as he manages to cast his ultimate. But Brewmaster is a slow farmer and he usually wants to fight well before he's gathered these expensive items.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Iron Branches are useful in boosting Brewmaster's early stats, making him tankier.<br/><br/>Bracer gives him more strength, as well as additional attack damage, and can be built into a Drum of Endurance later.<br/><br/>Bottle is commonly picked up if Brewmaster is in the mid lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Phase Boots aids his movement, and also multiplies nicely with his critical damage. The Phase ability will help him chase enemy heroes and position his Thunder Clap better.<br/><br/>Magic Wand gives him bonus attributes and a good source of regeneration.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a good midgame item that grants you a decent amount of health and gives you a nice boost in movement speed.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is critical to initiate, and improve on Brewmaster's low mobility.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Arcane Boots can be considered for more passive Brewmasters that rely on abilities rather than direct initiation.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives huge boost to health and mana. It also gives Primal Split spirits one of each of Brewmaster's abilities.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass makes Brewmaster even tankier, allowing him to survive longer engagements and getting off a Primal Split without needing to retreat. The aura also remains on each unit during his ultimate.<br/><br/>Blade Mail can be considered if Brewmaster's primary role is tanking.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is also useful for a tanking Brewmaster, as it reduces his reliance on Primal Split for survival.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives him an additional slow aside for Thunder Clap, as well as more armor for tankability.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque helps him withstand being focused down, as well as give him more attack damage. Note that Brewmaster will heal some of his health during Primal Split.<br/><br/>Radiance gives him even more damage, as well as damage enemies around him for as long as he stands.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering gives him a small boost in regeneration and armor, as well as lifesteal upon every attack, which works well together with his crits, helping out his survivability.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd gives some strength and even more evasion, along with the ability to disarm enemy attackers.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is sometimes picked up during the late game, allowing Brewmaster to jump in and initiate from across the map.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bristleback is a very good tank not only because of his formidable health pool, but also because of one of his abilities Bristleback, making him more of a tank when fighting his back. Being a carry and a tank at the same time, he can easily become team's initiator, capable of dealing and taking tons of health in a teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very durable.<br/><br/>Effective ganker early and mid game.<br/><br/>Can chase down fleeing enemy easily.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has mana issues in early and mid game.<br/><br/>Not effective against high-armor heroes.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Bristleback's mana woes can easily be remedied by a Sage's Mask or a Ring of Basilius, since his abilities have extremely low mana costs.<br/><br/>One of Bristleback's main weaknesses is his lack of disables, meaning he cannot silence or interrupt an enemy from casting spells. You can either rely on your teammates for disables, or buy an item of your own, so long as it benefits him in some way (a good example would be a Scythe of Vyse, since it gives him good mana regeneration for his abilities, and a devastating hex disable).<br/><br/>Beware Legion Commander and Axe, as both of them have abilities that force you to turn and face them for a few seconds, ensuring their and their teams damage is not directed to your back and thus making you far more vulnerable in a teamfight.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Viscous Nasal Goo</h4>Viscous Nasal Goo has extremely useful effects, provided that you keep casting it against your target, as it slows their movement speed for a lot when stacked up. Since each casts fully refreshes the whole stack's duration, and the duration is more than twice as long as the cooldown, after reaching the stack cap, you can time it so that you refresh the debuff before it expires, instead of continuously casting it whenever off cooldown. This way, you waste less of the duration, save some mana for your quills and can catch up faster to your target.<br/>This ability is very effective when combined with Warlock's Fatal Bonds, as the damage inflicted on the Viscous Nasal Goo target from other bound creeps or heroes is applied to the armor reduced hero at said reduced value. This makes the Bristleback/ Warlock lane combination very potent, even into the late game. When combined with area of effect items and attacks, a lot of damage can be dealt very quickly.<br/><br/><h4>Quill Spray</h4>Quill Spray can be used to secure last hits, whether from range or timing it with your regular attack.<br/><h4>Bristleback</h4>Use your passive ability Bristleback to your advantage; anticipate enemy attacks and turn your back on them, so that you can reduce as much damage as you can.<br/>Please note that you should not turn your back towards projectiles flying towards you, but the original damage source.<br/><br/>An early ability point on this ability during the laning phase can help you stay in the lane a while longer, especially if you are having trouble against attacks.<br/><br/><h4>Warpath</h4>Even if your enemies can easily defend against you with a Magic Wand, you can still heavily damage them with Warpath; as long as you're stacking your spells against them, the bonus damage will do its job.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Stout Shield is a strong pickup, as it helps cut down on lane harass when Bristleback is at his least tanky state and builds into Vanguard.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Ring of Health builds into both Vanguard and Hood of Defiance and can be picked up in the Side Shop, letting Bristleback weather almost any harass in lane.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius makes you slightly tankier and significantly increases your mana regen in the early game, as Bristleback starts with low intelligence, but has high intelligence gain. This means that disassembling the ring to make an Urn of Shadows or a Medallion of Courage is viable after Bristleback reaches 33 intelligence, naturally reached at level 7.<br/><br/>Magic Stick and Magic Wand are great on Bristleback, as he wants to be in a fight for as long as possible, giving him a chance to potentially use up charges twice for very large amounts of healing, and every two charges will grant him enough Mana for an extra Quill Spray or Viscous Nasal Goo.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Power Treads are the boots of choice on Bristleback, as they make him tankier and increase his attack speed, which goes well with Warpath.<br/><br/>Vanguard is one of a few strong early to mid-game pickups on Bristleback. It is best against teams that have a large amount of physical damage, and especially against teams with summons ( Enigma, Visage, etc) or dominated creeps ( Enchantress, Chen). Note that the damage block is deducted from the full attack damage, before any damage reduction (such as from armor or the Bristleback ability) takes place. Builds into a Crimson Guard.<br/><br/>Hood of Defiance, as opposed to Vanguard, is a much stronger choice when the enemies rather rely on magical damage. It upgrades into a Pipe of Insight.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Blade Mail is a hybrid pickup of damage and defense. It is strong against teams with high amounts of burst damage, either causing the enemies to take the damage themselves as well, or forcing them to not use their burst damage, giving Bristleback some time to deal with them.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a strong pickup if you're not the hardest carry on your team or the enemy team only has one physical damage dealer that it can be used on. The evasion as well as the strength increase can add a lot to Bristleback's effective health.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass has amazing synergy with Bristleback, as it is one of the few items that can increase the damage of his Quill Spray. It also increases his and his team's tankiness against physical damage, and the attack speed greatly increases his attack damage output thanks to Warpath. It also is a great pickup if there are other carries on your team which rely on physical attacks.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard is built off of a Vanguard, which is also a good item on Bristleback, and is an item any team should have one of if up against a physical damage heavy lineup.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is built off of a Hood of Defiance, which is also a good item on Bristleback, and is an item any team should have one of if there are any dangerous nukers on the enemy team.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is another large armor item, and it fixes any mana issues Bristleback can have. The active ability also gives Bristleback more presence in teamfights, damaging and slowing enemies in a huge area.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque grants a huge amount of health and gives you significant regeneration when not in a fight against heroes. It helps in siege situations, where you can soak up lots of damage and then wait a short time to be back at full health. The immense health boost allows Bristleback to use the passive Quill Spray to their full potential, as he can tank significantly more, retreat to heal up and then repeat.<br/><br/>Radiance is great on Bristleback if you can get it early in the game after a couple of items to tank up. This is basically a get-more-ahead item, as if you're hard to kill despite putting so much gold into an offensive item, it can be the best item to snowball the rest of the game by farming quickly and dealing massive area damage in teamfights. However, if you get this item at the cost of being tanky, this is a terrible item to pick up.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Centaur Warrunner is an aggressive tank who excels when he is placed in the middle of fights. He reflects damage with his passive ability Return, while stunning and attacking the area around him with Hoof Stomp and Double Edge. Unlike other tanks, Centaur Warrunner sacrifices some durability in exchange for damage output, and may have a hard time recovering if the early game does not go well.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky early game to late game<br/><br/>Can be useful to the team without large amounts of gold/items, but also benefits greatly from any gold he can get.<br/><br/>Can gank very effectively.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Countered by lifesteal.<br/><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>Low damage in the late game.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to enemy abilities which remove a percentage of health or kill at a certain health threshold.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Centaur Warrunner is usually played solo in the off-lane. However, with a support who has hard disables (such as Earthshaker or Lion) he can absolutely dominate the safe-lane and potentially get several kills.<br/><br/>Centaur Warrunner can also semi-jungle if the lane is going badly.<br/><br/>Centaur's actual damage is average at best in the early game, with slow attack speed and only one damaging ability that hurts himself as well. However, Return can do crippling damage to the enemy team if they choose to heavily harass him.<br/><br/>Centaur's late-game damage is entirely dependent upon how much Strength he has. If he ends up with over 200 strength (achieved by items such as Heart of Tarrasque and Armlet of Mordiggian) then he can deal frightening amounts of damage.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Hoof Stomp</h4>With a Blink Dagger, Hoof Stomp can be used as an initiation ability.<br/><br/>When trying to land Hoof Stomp on fleeing enemies, get in front of their path if possible. Most opponents will outrun the stun during the cast time if they are already on the edge of the radius.<br/><br/>Hoof Stomp has a long cast animation, and can be cancelled by the player or by enemies.<br/><h4>Double Edge</h4>Centaur cannot deny himself with Double Edge.<br/><br/>As Double Edge affects all enemies in a small radius around the target, it is very effective when taking on tight clusters of enemies. This includes jungle creeps, lane creeps, large amounts of enemy illusions, or multiple melee heroes trying to gang up on you.<br/><br/>It is generally not a good idea to use or skill into this ability until you have a Heart of Tarrasque, allowing you to quickly heal from the damage you deal to yourself.<br/><br/>Using Double Edge against enemies with unusually high magic resistance, such as Anti-Mage or Pudge, is not recommended, as it ends up hurting you more than it hurts the enemy.<br/><h4>Return</h4>Return is an extremely powerful ability and not to be underestimated. Although its most notable effect is greatly increasing damage against enemies that try to gank Centaur in the late game, even at lower levels it can completely shut down heroes with high damage and low health.<br/><br/>To force a tower to attack you and utilize Return, issue an attack command upon an enemy hero when in range (even one in another lane). This trick also works to aggravate lane creeps in order to push.<br/><h4>Stampede</h4>Stampede's effect is global. Keep an eye on allies and enemies across the map to use it when needed.<br/><br/>Stampede can be used offensively to allow you and your team to quickly initiate a teamfight, or chase down enemies trying to run away.<br/><br/>Stampede can be used defensively to help allies escape a bad situation.<br/><br/>Stampede only affects enemies once for a relatively short duration, so in larger fights the skill may go totally awry. This means the initiation must be careful and planned, with a chosen initiator, as with other fights (more than not, possibly Centaur himself).<br/><br/>In the late-game, if Centaur has the right items, Stampede can do upwards of 600 damage to every enemy hero affected by it (before reductions). This means that Centaur Warrunner or his teammates should try to trample over all enemy heroes if possible, as this can result in a whopping 3000 damage to the enemy team.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting</b><br/>Stout Shield and Infused Raindrop partially abates any harassment he receives.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection at the start of the game lets you make Tranquil Boots in lane from the Side Shop.<br/><br/>Tangoes and Healing Salve increases your survivability in lane.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango is useful to keep Centaur Warrunner in lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Items</b><br/>Magic Stick can increase your survivability in lane, and can be later turned into a Magic Wand to store extra charges and save inventory space.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed gives a nice movement speed boost.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots give you some extra survivability, and help negate the self-damage from Double Edge.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items</b><br/>Heart of Tarrasque grants extra survivability from the Health increase and health regen, and the Strength also increases damage done by attacks, Return, and Stampede. The massive health regen also allows for the near-constant use of Double Edge without needing to heal for a long time afterwards. Note that in the late-game it may be a good idea to buy a second or (rarely) even a third Heart, as they are the most gold-efficient source of Strength.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is a very cheap and effective source of Strength and Armor, increasing damage and tankiness greatly. It should be activated constantly, as your various health regen items will counteract its health drain.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items</b><br/>Vanguard can be a good purchase if playing against many physical heroes. Later upgrade to a Crimson Guard to help defend your team, or an Abyssal Blade for more stuns.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel further increases your ability to initiate by being able to teleport to almost anywhere on the map, as well as having extra movement speed.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a good, cheap source of armor and mana regen, two things that are often badly needed.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is essential to initiating with Hoof Stomp. It is a necessary item if your team has no other heroes that can initiate well.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter's buff is sometimes useful, but mostly during games where you already have an advantage.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight will help your team deal with enemy initiation and nukes, while reducing the health cost of Double Edge.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass turns centaur into a full tank, as well as providing his team with extra armor.<br/><br/>Radiance can be a luxury item when your team is winning, as Centaur will be able to live long enough to burn down the enemy.<br/><br/>Blade Mail's damage reflect stacks with Return, making Centaur an even less appetizing target. However, enemies will probably already be focusing on your teammates in a fight rather than you.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd grants strength, and also the ability to disarm enemies, which can be useful in the late game when Centaur's damage falls off.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Chaos Knight is a powerful strength hero dealing High Physical DPS that smashes his foes with straight, but powerful hits due to his Chaos Strike. Chaos Bolt is a luck-base spell that makes it hard to use, and he can close the gap with his enemies through Reality Rift. Phantasm has long recharge time, it would be recommended to time your ultimate for teamfights only. Chaos Knight requires adequate farming and an aggressive mindset to trample enemy Heroes. Once enough farming, he can overpower the late game with lots of Physical DPS with his Illusions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Good movement speed.<br/><br/>Great late game.<br/><br/>Can be aggressive in early and mid game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very RNG reliant.<br/><br/>Small mana pool.<br/><br/>Very tempting for enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Highly reliant on his ultimate.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>In most situations, max Chaos Bolt and Reality Rift first, since the critical damage from your Chaos Strike is negligible in the early game.<br/><br/>Always activate your Armlet of Mordiggian before using your ultimate, since the illusions also gain bonuses from it.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is sub-optimal even for ganking CK, better of finishing  Heaven's Halber if you have the mana.<br/><br/>If you manage to farm a Manta Style you gain two additional albeit somewhat weaker illusions that serve to wreck havoc among enemy ranks, Manta Style illusions much like Phantasm and rune illusions are pulled to your target with Reality Rift. You can often use this to block your target in a swarm of illusions they will not be able to escape from. The ultimate orb from Manta Style also boosts your mana pool just enough to allow you to cast illusions together with your ultimate ability.<br/><br/>It is not entirely advisable to pick Chaos Knight against enemies that can easily clear illusions such as Medusa, Lion, Pugna owning to the fact that they can clear illusions regardless of their stats and given that your illusions are produced by your ultimate ability with a rather long cooldown you cannot afford to have them destroyed easily like Naga Siren, Terrorblade and Phantom Lancer who can produce illusions much more frequently.<br/><br/>You may also want to be careful against an enemy that drains mana such as Quas Wex focused Invoker. Given Chaos Knight's dismal mana pool and intelligence gain Invoker's EMP can completely drain him of mana even in later stages of the game and without his active abilities Chaos Knight is not nearly as potent.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Chaos Bolt</h4>Although Chaos Bolt's damage is average, it's not to be underestimated. a lucky strike of 275 damage can be the difference between killing or failing to kill an enemy.<br/><br/>Chaos Bolt, like Storm Hammer and Wraithfire Blast is easy to predict and disjoint, even easier due to Chaos Knight's poor cast animation. Try to use it as close to an enemy as possible if they have a way to dodge it.<br/>Unlike Sven and Wraith King however, Chaos Knight can use Reality Rift to get in melee range of an enemy and make it a lot harder to disjoint your stun.<br/><br/><br/>Due to the unreliability of the spell, it makes Chaos Knight a poor initiator if he is in the field of vision of the enemy, and it is generally better to let your allies initiate the battle. If you are roaming, try to surprise and ambush your enemies, or use a Smoke of Deceit to increase your odds of landing the spell.<br/><br/>At level 1, Chaos Bolt has a guaranteed one second stun duration, while it only attains a guaranteed two second stun duration at level 4. As such, it may be prudent to either leave Chaos Bolt at level 1 or rush it to level 4 to get the most out of the spell.<br/><h4>Reality Rift</h4>While ganking in the early-mid game, use Reality Rift to get close to the enemy, then hit him once with your bonus damage and use Chaos Bolt to stun. If you are lucky, you could even get more than two hits while he is stunned.<br/><br/>Reality Rift will reduce your target's armor by a flat value, making your auto attacks stronger overall.<br/>Due to being a flat value, this reduction falls off late game.<br/><br/>Illusions benefit from the armor reduction.<br/><br/><br/>This ability will place you and your target at a random position between the distance of both characters. This can result in Chaos Knight and his target becoming trapped within trees or in elevated terrain.<br/><br/>Reality Rift will not only teleport Chaos Knight, but any illusions active when the ability is cast, including illusions from Phantasm. Consider this before using this ability.<br/><br/>A level 4 Reality Rift is usually much better than a level 4 Chaos Bolt, as the reduction in cooldown makes it a viable chasing skill.<br/><h4>Chaos Strike</h4>Since Chaos Strike has only 12% chance to proc, it is an unreliable form of damage. In comparison to other critical passives, such as Wraith King's Mortal Strike, it has a lower chance of occurring but also comes with 65% lifesteal on each proc.<br/>Against enemies that can easily kite Chaos Knight, you should focus on his other abilities rather than Chaos Strike. Also, if there is uncontested farm in lane skip Chaos Strike until level 11.<br/><br/><h4>Phantasm</h4>If you know for sure a fight is about to start, it's sometimes better to use your ultimate before it even starts off. The illusions have a very long duration and if you can find a good target to Reality Rift it can immediately turn a fight in your favor. Be mindful not to use it under enemy vision as they may immediately back away.<br/><br/>Also, if your enemies have huge teamfight AOEs, they may be specifically waiting for you to cast Phantasm in the middle of the fight to jump on you.<br/><br/>However, if all their abilities are meant to counter your army, it could be wise to keep it until they've blown some of them on different targets.<br/><br/>If that would be the case, it could be safer to use your illusions only to push towers, keeping your hero and the rest of your team safely behind. The illusions long duration should even enable you to split push a bit to make counter the enemy's teamfight strategy.<br/><br/>Your illusions pack a huge punch. They will automatically attack whoever you're pulling with Reality Rift. This target may instantly blow up. Don't forget to micro-manage your illusions while that target is dead and Rift is on cooldown. The same is true if you're dead. If you're confident with your micro-management skills, the best strategy is probably to send one after every enemy hero, similarly to Spectre's Haunt or try killing off supports, and against their buildings if you still have some left to spare.<br/><br/>Phantasm has a very long cooldown. It is generally unwise to use it as a last-ditch effort when you're about to die since it would still be on cooldown well after you've respawned. However, like Manta Style and Mirror Image it does provide a short instant of invulnerability that can help you disjoint spells, such as Disruptor's Glimpse.<br/>The potential to disjoint spells can have an incredible impact on teamfights and the game overall, allowing you and your illusions to survive for longer and deal more damage.<br/><br/><br/>Phantasm boasts the most powerful illusions in the game, creating an army that can boost Chaos Knight's damage output for up to 400%. When used in conjunction with Reality Rift and Chaos Bolt it is often possible to destroy the target before they get a chance for retaliation. Given that your illusions do full damage and are far more durable than illusions produced by any other hero always remember that even if your main hero dies your illusions still pose a very serious threat.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items</b><br/>Iron Branches are very cheap and give small attribute bonuses.<br/><br/>Tango and a Healing Salve, along with a Stout Shield allow to take a bit of damage while going for last hits.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early items</b><br/>Boots of Speed give a nice movement speed boost.<br/><br/>Magic Wand provides instant mana and health during battles.<br/><br/>Helm of Iron Will gives some armor and health regeneration. It builds into Armlet of Mordiggian.<br/><br/> Enchanted Mango will solve Chaos Knight's mana issues and also provides health regeneration before it is used.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads are easily the strongest boot on Chaos Knight, as they provide tankiness, which transfer to his illusions, and allow him to tread switch if he has a source of regeneration.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian most cost effective item for Chaos Knight. It provides a very large amount of strength, which will transfer to his illusions if it is activated before Phantasm is used. As Chaos Knight's main source of damage is his illusions, this allows them to stick around much longer.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque makes Chaos Knight and his illusions very durable, and gives them a nice damage boost. This also enables you to keep Armlet of Mordiggian permanently on, as the heart will regen faster than the health loss, resulting in a large amount of bonus strength, damage, and attack speed at all times.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Assault Cuirass is a very strong pickup, giving Chaos Knight and the illusions armor and the much needed attack speed.<br/><br/>Black King Bar provides a bit of tankiness and a bit of damage on top of much prized magic immunity. As magic immunity does not transfer to illusions, this is best when picked up against teams that can easily isolate the real CK and either lock him down for a long period of time or burst him down with single target magical damage.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a strong pickup for Chaos Knight late game, if there are strong right-click heroes on the enemy team, or when sange was brought instead of armlet<br/><br/>Manta Style is a strong pickup on Chaos Knight if the enemy team does not have a way to clear out your illusions. They take more damage and deal less damage than the illusions made by Phantasm. However combined with a level 3 Phantasm, Reality Rift will completely surround and trap any enemy that does not have the ability to blink away, phase through, or instantly kill an illusion; this often guarantees a kill. Do not rush this item, Chaos Knight does not have enough health to ensure that the illusions will last and will just waste mana.<br/><br/>Satanic gives strength and armor, which increases durability. Its active ability allows Chaos Knight to stay in the fight much longer. Note that illusions do not lifesteal.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade will give Chaos Knight's illusions Manabreak. Unlike other illusion heroes such as Phantom Lancer, which need the manabreak for damage, Chaos Knights does not need it for damage as a carry CK's illusion usually will kill the target instantly after a Reality Rift. Only get it to counter heroes like Windranger.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is the most efficient stat item in the game, second only to Armlet of Mordiggian; It makes you and your illusions far stronger by giving you 25 strength and 25 agility, and with 25 intelligence it almost single-handedly fixes any mana issues Chaos Knight could have by giving nearly 600 points of raw mana and some regen.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows will provide Chaos Knight with early game regeneration and will allow Chaos Strike to be skipped until level 11. Should be core on a ganking Chaos Knight.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar to counter heroes with evasion.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Clockwerk is a tanky initiator and ganker built to isolate and separate enemies. His array of disables and nukes provide strong crowd control in any situation, allowing him to greatly disrupt the enemy. Rocket Flare provides distant scouting vision, and Hookshot allows Clockwerk to initiate from extreme distances. He specializes in trapping and zoning out enemies with Power Cogs, allowing him and his team to pick off single heroes. With Blade Mail, his core item, Clockwerk reflects damage and forces enemies to risk their lives by attacking him, or entering deeper into his team formation to find different targets. His abilities require good positioning and aim, which can be daunting for newer players. Clockwerk's damage scales badly into the late game, where his purpose will be limited to initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky, super long range initiator.<br/><br/>Powerful area control.<br/><br/>Effective ganker.<br/><br/>Good scouting vision.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low damage in the late game.<br/><br/>Requires good aim.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Clockwerk's main purpose is to force enemies to fight him one on one inside his Power Cogs, where Battery Assault and Blade Mail gives him an advantage.<br/><br/>Clockwerk has very strong initiation abilities, but his damage scale off greatly the longer a game goes due to enemies' mana and HP pools getting larger. As such, he is most effective in the early- and mid-game where he can get ganks off and secure map control for his team to gain an early advantage.<br/><br/>While he has good base strength and impressive strength growth, Clockwerk suffers from poor base agility, meaning that he is quite vulnerable to physical damage if he does not get any armor items.<br/><br/>Clockwerk's caster-oriented skill set means that he needs a source of mana regeneration in order to be effective. Due to all this and his strong initiation spells, Clockwerk benefits most from building items that give him survivability, mobility and mana.<br/><br/>Clockwerk can be effective in the early to mid-game even without many items.<br/><br/>In most cases, Clockwerk is played as an off-laner, as his spells allow him to harass the enemy while also providing a measure of survivability. As well, he can be very powerful with early levels, becoming a strong roamer and ganker once he hits level 6.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Battery Assault</h4>Battery Assault works best if Clockwerk can single out and lock a lone enemy inside Power Cogs. As the shrapnel hits random targets within a certain radius of Clockwerk, removing random targets from the equation allows Clockwerk to inflict all of the damage on a single enemy, often resulting in a kill.<br/><br/>Activate Battery Assault before initiating with Hookshot or Power Cogs to save time and maximize damage.<br/><br/>Battery Assault is a very strong chasing spell that works best if Clockwerk has more movement speed than his target. The mini-stun from the shrapnel will force enemies to stop each time they are hit, drastically impeding their attempts to flee. This allows Clockwerk to guaranteed slow an enemy down for the full duration of the spell after getting within range to land one mini-stun, and gives any nearby allies time to catch up.<br/><br/>Never underestimate the amount of damage that Battery Assault can deal to a lone target in the early game. With just two levels in the ability, it is possible to run down and kill enemies by yourself in the laning stage if you can catch them away from other units.<br/><br/>Battery Assault will not hit invisible units. Therefore, it is highly recommended to carry Dust of Appearance or Sentry Wards if you are ganking a hero with invisibility spells or items.<br/><br/>Heroes with long cast or attack animations (over 0.6 seconds), will be continuously interrupted by Battery Assault, assuming there are no other units in range.<br/><br/>To interrupt a channeling enemy, simply walk next to them while Battery Assault is active.<br/><h4>Power Cogs</h4>Power Cogs is a powerful harass and escape spell in the laning stage. Against melee carries, Clockwerk can easily get within range to shock them with the cogs when they approach the creeps to get a last-hit, destroying their HP and mana at little cost to himself.<br/><br/>Erect Power Cogs as a defensive barrier when being ganked. The pushback will give Clockwerk enough time to get away.<br/><br/>Power Cogs together with Battery Assault can be thought of as a way to disable dangerous enemies. By pinning down a target inside the barrier with Clockwerk, Battery Assault can mini-stun and damage on the target for several seconds.<br/><br/>Power Cogs can be destroyed in two enemy attacks unless they are level 4. If you are attempting to lock down an enemy and don't have level 4 cogs, it can be beneficial to simply block the enemy's path with the cogs from outside rather than locking them in, as the shock can provide additional damage and stun, and the enemy will be forced to destroy at least two cogs in order to go in the direction they wish to.<br/><br/>Used as an initiating tool, Power Cogs can greatly impede enemies' movements whether they are outside or within the barrier.<br/>Placing the cogs in a certain area can inflict several of the enemy with the shock and prevent them from moving in that direction, which can be used to cut off escapes or deter advance.<br/><br/><br/>Locking down targets within the barrier allows your team to hit them with AoE nukes like Mystic Flare, Split Earth, Ghostship, Sun Ray, and so on.<br/>Beware that the same vulnerability applies to Clockwerk. Even though Clockwerk can destroy his own cogs, the time it takes to do so will also allow enemy nukers to deal much damage to him.<br/>This can be countered if Clockwerk uses Blade Mail at the right time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Remember that Power Cogs can be destroyed by Clockwerk in one hit, which is useful for escape when a gank or initiation goes wrong.<br/><br/>When ganking lone targets from behind, it can be useful to utilize Power Cogs' shock rather than locking down an enemy inside. The cogs can deal additional damage and reduce the enemy's mana, and block off the enemy's retreat. The shock can also be used as an additional disable to stun the enemy for a short amount of time.<br/><br/>The pushback can be used to displace enemies over impassable terrain, such as pushing them onto or over a cliff. This is especially common when used in and around the Roshan Pit.<br/><br/>The pushback stuns enemies, which will interrupt channeling spells or items if Battery Assault and Hookshot are on cooldown.<br/><br/>Be very careful about when and where you use Power Cogs, as they will impede allied movement as well as that of enemies. Deploying Power Cogs at the wrong moment or place can trap teammates or hinder pursuit against enemies.<br/><br/>Clockwerk usually starts with a point in Power Cogs since it allows him to trap his creep wave inside the cogs so the creeps meet close enough to his tower so that he can't be zoned out by the enemy supports. If you're really desperate for some exp, you can even trap the first wave twice, then trap the second or third wave...<br/><br/>One point in Power Cogs is usually enough for the early game, and can be leveled last after that.<br/><h4>Rocket Flare</h4>Rocket Flare can be used to last hit creeps in lane, and to break Clarity and Healing Salve on enemy heroes from long range.<br/><br/>Use Rocket Flare's global range to pick off retreating enemies.<br/><br/>Use Rocket Flare to give Clockwerk vision for Hookshot.<br/><br/>During the early game, your skill points are better spent on your other spells, so one or two levels of Rocket Flare is enough.<br/><br/>Try to use Rocket Flare where your team has little or no vision.<br/><br/>Rocket Flare's area damage is useful for pushing lanes across the map.<br/><br/>If you have advance notice that your team intends to gank in another lane, try to send a rocket at the enemy to add your own nuke damage as well.<br/><br/>Besides the lingering flying vision given over its destination, it also provides vision as it travels, so overshooting the rocket can allow you to scout out more area.<br/><br/>Never hesitate to use your rocket to check behind treelines where you suspect the enemy may be, and be sure to occasionally check Roshan Pit if the entire enemy team is missing.<br/><h4>Hookshot</h4>Hookshot is the longest ranged initiating ability in the game, allowing Clockwerk to almost instantly stun and close the distance with any enemy that he has a clear line of engagement towards.<br/><br/>Be wary of obstructions in Hookshot's path. Make sure Clockwerk is not behind any allies, and that there are no neutral creep camps in its path.<br/><br/>Keep your finger on the Stop hotkey (S by default) to immediately cancel Hookshot's cast animation if it looks like you're going to miss.<br/><br/>Take advantage of Hookshot's long cast range to initiate on an enemy who doesn't even know that you're in the same part of the map.<br/><br/>Use Power Cogs immediately after Hookshot to lock the enemy in place.<br/>The stun duration allows Clockwerk to even move a short distance away before dropping the Power Cogs if he chooses to block off their escape route and push them back with the shock.<br/><br/><br/>While Hookshot is very powerful for initiating on lone enemies, its long cast range also allows Clockwerk to jump on enemies in the rear line of teamfights. This can be useful for disrupting the enemy's supports and preventing them from effectively participating, as well as for getting in position to split the battlefield with Power Cogs.<br/>In the same idea, it can be just as valuable to jump on that squishy enemy glass cannon ( Sniper, Clinkz...) that sits behind his team's front-liners rather than let them dish out their damage.<br/><br/><br/>Hookshot to allied heroes, creeps, and neutral creeps to quickly escape a bad situation.<br/><br/>Hookshot can stun enemies through spell immunity. As such, it can be used as a last resort if an enemy has activated spell immunity and is trying to teleport away.<br/><br/>If you suspect the enemy is in the Roshan Pit, a Hookshot will usually hit a target in the cramped space, surprising the enemy team without giving away your intentions with Rocket Flare.<br/><br/>In the late game with Aghanim's Scepter, players with good aim can use Hookshot as a method of travel, jumping across the map constantly.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve give Clockwerk enough basic lane survivability through health regen. Depending on how much harass is expected in the off-lane, more than one Tango may be advised.<br/><br/>Stout Shield gives Clockwerk protection against harassment in-lane, as he is a melee hero who must walk within range to get last-hits.<br/><br/>Iron Branches are cheap and give Clockwerk stats in all categories, giving him more HP, some armor and attack speed, and mana.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed early on give Clockwerk enough movement speed to evade ganks by the enemy's supports. They also allow him to chase with Battery Assault and get early kills against squishy supports if he can single them out.<br/><br/>Bracer gives Clockwerk useful stats, especially strength for more HP and base damage. The additional HP helps him to survive enemy nukes and attacks when initiating.<br/><br/>Bottle is important on Clockwerk given his mobility, ability to roam around and gank targets, and small mana pool. As he can pick up runes while roaming, the regen lets him stay out on the field without having to return to base as often, allowing him to accomplish more for his team.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius can be a useful item to purchase on Clockwerk during the laning stage, as his low base intelligence means that its flat mana regen benefits him disproportionately. The extra armor also gives him more survivability, and the extra damage helps with last-hitting. It can be disassembled to build other items using the components, or built into a Vladmir's Offering.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a very useful utility item on a roaming Clockwerk in place of a Bracer. The strength gives him more HP and base damage, while the mana regen helps with his casting. The active can be used to deal more damage to an enemy during a gank, or heal yourself or allies afterward.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots give Clockwerk more mobility, allowing him to get in position to cast his spells or chase an enemy more easily with Battery Assault. The extra damage also lets him last-hit more easily, and deal more damage to enemies penned in by Power Cogs<br/><br/>Power Treads can be useful to pick up on Clockwerk depending on your build. Being able to switch attributes can allow Clockwerk to take better advantage of Bottle, and reduces the mana cost of his spells while also allowing him to give himself more HP during initiations. As well, the increased attack speed helps with his right-click damage output in teamfights or while farming.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots can be useful to purchase on a utility Clockwerk who is dependent on casting spells and using item abilities. Clockwerk's main weakness is his small mana pool, so alleviating that allows him to cast his spells more often.<br/><br/>Magic Wand gives Clockwerk some stats, and allows him to replenish some HP and mana instantly. The former is useful for giving him more HP after casting Hookshot to initiate on the enemy, extending his survivability, while the latter can give him enough mana to cast any of his spells in an emergency.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is arguably Clockwerk's most important item. The armor gives him more survivability against physical damage when initiating with Hookshot, the intelligence gives him a bigger mana pool to cast spells, and the damage gives him more damage output. The active allows him to use his HP pool offensively by punishing the enemy for focusing him, and can buy him survivability if the enemy avoids targeting him while the item is active.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should always be carried by all heroes. Clockwerk's initiating power is useful at all times in teamfights, ganks and counter-ganks.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Observer Ward can be bought when necessary, as Clockwerk is not extremely reliant on items.<br/><br/>Dust of Appearance is ideal for ganking invisible enemies, as Clockwerk's close promixity after initiation guarantees the debuff will be applied without guesswork. Remember that Battery Assault cannot hit invisible enemies.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter significantly reduces Hookshot's cooldown, and gives him stats across the board. The reduced cooldown allows Clockwerk to use his ultimate tactically, as he can cast it multiple times in a single teamfight.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Clockwerk stats across the board, generally increasing his survivability as well as ability to cast spells. The movement speed aura also makes him more mobile, allowing him to position for spells or chase more easily.<br/><br/>Vanguard is a very good item to get on Clockwerk as it increases his survivability during initiations. As Clockwerk is already very resistant against magic nukes, the damage block makes him quite tough against physical attacks as well, and the HP regen allows him to maintain his HP pool in the field, meaning less returns to base.<br/><br/>Force Staff gives Clockwerk an extra tool for more mobility on top of the highly beneficial intelligence, allowing him to quickly close the gap to cast Power Cogs or Battery Assault, or escape from unpleasant situations. Its most powerful use is to allow Clockwerk to escape from inside his own Power Cogs without having to destroy them, allowing him to trap dangerous melee enemies inside that could otherwise tear him apart with right-clicks.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger drastically increases Clockwerk's mobility and gives him yet more initiating power. Clockwerk can blink on top of enemies to initiate rather than using Hookshot, or use the blink to quickly re-position himself for a clear line of fire for Hookshot.<br/><br/>Mekansm gives Clockwerk stats across the board, additional armor, and a way to heal himself and his team, especially after using Hookshot to initiate. However, its high mana cost means that you should increase the size of your mana pool if you want to build this item.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a useful survivability and aura item that can give Clockwerk's team an edge in fights. The armor aura increases Clockwerk's survivability, and the mana regen and lifesteal can allow him to roam over extended periods of time without returning to base for HP or mana.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives Clockwerk a powerful amount of utility for a cheap support item. The extra movement speed helps Clockwerk to chase down enemies with Battery Assault, and the intelligence and mana regen allow him to cast his spells much more often. The active adds yet another disable to Clockwerk's repertoire, allowing him to disable another enemy after a Hookshot initiation or stopping someone in their tracks so that you can walk over and surround them with Power Cogs. As well, the active can be used on Clockwerk himself to give him temporary invulnerability while at the same time removing debuffs.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb is extremely strong on Clockwerk, as it serves many of the same purposes as Blade Mail. It gives Clockwerk regen and armor, increasing his durability and staying power. The active can be cast during Hookshot-Cog initiations to use the enemy's targeted spells against them if they decide to attempt to focus Clockwerk down.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard is a good utility upgrade from Vanguard, as it gives Clockwerk additional armor for a modest buildup. The active can greatly help your team in fights, and drastically increases Clockwerk's survivability against physical damage during initiations.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a good utility item that increases Clockwerk's initiating power. Besides the stats and armor, Clockwerk is uniquely qualified to use the item's active ability as he will often find himself right in the middle of the enemy after Hookshotting in, allowing him to apply the magic resistance debuff to the enemy team and making his team's magic nukes hit for more, as well as those of Clockwerk himself.<br/><br/>Necronomicon has strong synergy with Clockwerk. Using the item after initiating on an enemy with Hookshot and Power Cogs can trap them inside the barrier with you and two summons that help to deal additional damage, on top of providing True Sight within the area once it is upgraded. It also provides strength and intelligence to Clockwerk, giving him more HP and mana.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves is a strong boots item that gives Clockwerk strong survivability if upgraded from a Mekansm and Arcane Boots. The aura gives him increased survivability when initiating with Hookshot-Cog, particularly once its bonuses increase when his health drops below a certain threshold, and the self-dispel can remove debuffs from him, increasing his survivability.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight allows Clockwerk to shield himself and his team from magical nukes, and gives him significantly more survivability after initiating with Hookshot as he can resist enemy magic nukes more easily.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque greatly increases Clockwerk's HP pool and gives him some base damage. The greatly increased durability allows him to initiate without fear of being quickly destroyed by the enemy, which can allow him to make full use of his disables in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Radiance allows Clockwerk to inflict burn damage to the enemy during Hookshot initiations, as well as when chasing enemies down with Battery Assault. The induced miss chance also gives him and his team increased survivability against physical attacks, as all enemies affected by the burn will miss some of their attacks no matter who the attacks are directed at.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard increases the size of Clockwerk's mana pool, allowing him to cast spells more often, and greatly increases his survivability against physical damage. The active can be cast prior to using Hookshot, instantly applying the nuke damage and slow to the entire enemy team upon reaching your destination.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Doom is a versatile carry who can become a powerful late-game threat due to his ability to quickly farm with Devour, his strong nuking power, and his ultimate Doom that lets him disable an enemy for at least 15 seconds. His skill set and fast farming potential allows him to be built in any number of ways to meet the enemy threat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Doom's ultimate is one of the strongest single target disables in the game.<br/><br/>Devour boosts gold income and grants Doom access to jungle creep abilities.<br/><br/>High base STR and high STR growth gives Doom naturally high HP and base damage.<br/><br/>Potent scaling damage-over-time debuff from Infernal Blade.<br/><br/>Versatile hero that can be built in a variety of different ways, as either a support or core.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable to ranged heroes<br/><br/>Very vulnerable to slows<br/><br/>Low starting base armor<br/><br/>Little to no armor increase through stats<br/><br/>Has low intelligence<br/><br/>Has low base agility and low agility gain<br/><br/>Has a 2.0 BAT (the lowest in the game), with low agility (base and gain), making the use of his nuke very unreliable<br/><br/>Nuke is considered a normal right-click, meaning it can miss if the opponent hero has evasion.<br/><br/>Can't properly tank without his 2nd skill<br/><br/>Any other proper tank can be a better aura carry, if they get equal or more farm than Doom<br/><br/>Vulnerable to early harassment<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One of Doom's greatest weaknesses is his minimal base armor and extremely low agility, making him very vulnerable to physical damage despite being a strength hero, and reducing his physical damage output potential. As well, he has the lowest base attack time in the game, meaning that his attack speed is extremely slow unless boosted by items. Therefore, he must build armor items in order to survive in teamfights, and attack speed items in order to be able to deal any damage to enemies.<br/><br/>Due to his Devour ability, Doom is a good farmer who can quickly get the gold to purchase many strong core items to alleviate his weaknesses. His ability to obtain gold and experience using this ability also allows him to greatly diversify and play many different roles depending on what his team needs.<br/>In general, Doom is best played as a safe lane carry, as his ability to farm can allow him to get numerous powerful items that give him strong teamfight presence. The degree to which he can carry is almost unlimited, and can be chosen depending on which stage of the game it is best to end on based on the enemy team's lineup.<br/><br/>Doom's ability to instantly kill creeps with Devour makes him a respectable jungler, as he can farm neutral camps relatively quickly with the ability. He can also rotate with any abilities he has gained through consuming creeps to gank the enemy as needed.<br/><br/>With a few points in Scorched Earth, Doom can be a very strong off-laner, as the spell can give him the mobility and survivability he needs to stay alive. Devour allows him to consume creeps, both enemy and neutral, to guarantee gold and experience gain, while Infernal Blade allows him to inflict surprising amounts of damage against enemy supports that attempt to trade hits with him.<br/><br/>Doom can also play a utility or support role, as his ultimate gives him a way to contribute to a teamfight regardless of how much farm he has. Devour allows him to obtain gold without being given major farm priority, meaning that even if given the priority of a hard support he can get gold to buy items that help him or his team.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Devour</h4>Devour allows Doom to instantly kill a target non-friendly creep, gaining the gold and experience bounty immediately and then bonus gold after consuming it.<br/><br/>Devour is Doom's strongest early-game spell, as it accelerates his gold and experience gain, giving him an early advantage. It should generally be the first spell that is maxed out, as it allows Doom to obtain early levels and fast core items if left alone by the enemy team.<br/><br/>Assuming it is always used when off cooldown, Devour increases Doom's GPM by 21/50/90/150 (90/130/186/270 with talent) - not including the bounty from the creep it is used on. For comparison, Midas gives 132 GPM.<br/><br/>The ability to steal neutral creep abilities is very strong, as Doom gains both the active and passive abilities. This allows him to choose a creep that gives him the most benefits depending on what opponents he is facing or what he needs in-lane. Good Doom play requires understanding each neutral creep's strengths and how they can be best utilized depending on the situation; certain creeps are very powerful in the laning stage or give an edge while jungling, while others are powerful for initiating or disabling enemies in fights, and still others provide auras or can place buffs that greatly benefit the whole team in the late game.<br/>If you are going to jungle at the start of the game, a Satyr Tormenter should be first priority to use your Devour on, as its Unholy Aura greatly increases your survivability and regeneration and makes up for Doom's low attack speed and armor. This is not recommended if you are going to lane, however, as the aura pushes the lane and either makes you more vulnerable to ganks or hurts your farm, while Shockwave uses too much mana to be spammed in lane for harass.<br/><br/>A very good choice for at early game is to devour a Hill Troll Priest as it is useful if you are either going to jungle or lane. In lane it provides you and your lane partner much higher mana regen (even higher than the bonus Crystal Maiden provides with a level 3 or lower Arcane Aura), allowing you to continuously spam your abilities. In addition, its Heal can allow you to heal without using consumables (this is rather inefficient due to the longer cast time it has when used by Doom).<br/><br/>If you intent to gank often or simply want to score early kills, good choices for Devour targets would be the Ghost, Centaur Conqueror, Hellbear Smasher or the Satyr Banisher. The Ghost's Frost Attack can in coalition with an Orb of Venom greatly slow the enemy; provided you continue to hit them. A Centaur Conqueror's War Stomp can potentially stun the enemy for a reasonably lengthy duration and score your team a kill, but its small radius and big delay when cast by Doom makes it very unreliable and requires good positioning to be successfully used. The Satyr Banisher's Purge is a very strong ganking ability, as it not only greatly slows the enemy and has an extremely low cooldown (3 seconds), but it also dispels many buffs. A Hellbear Smasher's Thunder Clap is often times more reliable than War Stomp and its Swiftness Aura allows you to deal more blows, but it pushes your lane once the gank is over so you should quickly replace the abilities with others.<br/><br/>Mud Golems are also possible choices, as they give you a reliable but somewhat weak nuke and stun in Hurl Boulder, although you should mind the large cooldown. Their greatest strength, however, is in Shard Split, which spawns two Doomlings on your death, both of which have the Hurl Boulder ability. If the enemy is weakened enough and they do not dispose of the Doomlings quickly, you may get your revenge from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>Devouring a Kobold Foreman for Speed Aura is also a good choice because it grants a movement speed aura that allows Doom and nearby allies to gank more effectively or outmaneuver the enemy team during fights.<br/><br/>Obviously, the best choice for late game is the Alpha Wolf, which not only increases the right-click damage of your entire team with Packleader's Aura, but it also gives you a Critical Strike, both of which greatly amplify your strength as a carry.<br/><br/><br/>Keep in mind, Doom must digest any creep that has been devoured before he can use Devour again, even if it has come off cooldown. Doom digests creeps at a rate of 20 HP per second, based on the HP of the creep when it was eaten, so at higher levels of Devour it is often necessary to damage a creep somewhat before devouring it.<br/><br/>Beware that you get the bonus gold at the end of the digestion period, and that you lose the debuff upon death, so if you are killed while you are digesting a creep you do not gain the bonus gold. This means that it is a good habit to work down creeps in order to cut down the digestion period, as getting ganked by the enemy can cost you more than just unreliable gold upon death.<br/><h4>Scorched Earth</h4>Scorched Earth increases Doom's movement speed while simultaneously giving him HP regen and magical burn damage in an area around him.<br/><br/>Due to the amount of health regeneration and damage it provides, Scorched Earth is a good ability to max out early in a match. The self-heal can greatly increase Doom's survivability in engagements, which in turn helps to keep him alive and active on the map rather than retreating to base to heal or respawning.<br/><br/>Regardless of leveling priority, at least one early level of Scorched Earth is recommended, as the movement speed boost is the same at all levels. The extra speed can be crucial in the early game to chase enemies down or outrun pursuers.<br/><br/>Due to its instant cast time, Scorched Earth allows Doom to activate it without breaking stride, which can help him to chase or escape without stopping to cast the spell.<br/><br/>If jungling, Scorched Earth can give a measure of additional damage output and HP regen. This can be additionally powerful if the Dark Troll Summoner from the Troll Camp has been previously devoured, as the summoned Skeleton Warriors also gain the HP regen from the spell.<br/><br/>Scorched Earth is a strong candidate for maxing out early, after Devour. In early game engagements, the burn damage and heal can allow Doom to efficiently trade attacks with the enemy, allowing him to be aggressive in the laning stage.<br/><br/>Be very mindful of Scorched Earth's extremely long cooldown. While it costs comparatively little mana to cast, the long cooldown means that using it to farm leaves you vulnerable once the spell's effects end, as you no longer have a movement speed boost or HP regen spell available for some time. Try to only use Scorched Earth when absolutely necessary, as the mobility and survivability it grants can make a huge difference if you are ganked.<br/><h4>Infernal Blade</h4>Infernal Blade is an attack modifier that allows Doom to inflict a damage-over time burn on enemies he attacks, damaging them for a portion of their maximum health. The initial strike with the spell also mini-stuns its target.<br/><br/>Because Infernal Blade's damage is expressed as a percentage of the target's maximum HP, it scales into the late game, reliably dealing damage no matter how much health the enemy has. However, due to Doom's need to farm and stay alive in the early game, it is wise to avoid leveling Infernal Blade too much until after both Devour and Scorched Earth are maxed out.<br/><br/>Due to its ability to mini-stun targets upon attack, an early value point in Infernal Blade can greatly benefit Doom and his team. Stopping an enemy channeled spell or interrupting a Town Portal Scroll can halt powerful enemy spells or prevent them from escaping or reinforcing their teammates.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that despite its low mana cost, Infernal Blade has a very long cooldown at low levels, limiting its damage output. As well, Doom's low base intelligence means that even casting the spell a few times in the early game can greatly drain his mana pool, preventing him from casting his other spells as needed. Try to avoid using Infernal Blade profligately, and cast it only when necessary to either inflict harass damage against lane opponents or when the nuke damage is needed for a kill attempt.<br/><br/>As a castable attack modifier, Doom can manually inflict enemies with Infernal Blade during the laning stage without drawing creep aggro. Even though the percentage-based fraction of damage does not do much, the flat damage portion is much stronger in the laning stage, allowing Doom to inflict powerful harass damage against enemies should he get within range to trade auto-attacks with them.<br/><br/>When casting Infernal Blade during a fight, try to utilize the mini-stun as a disable if possible. Rather than trying to inflict the debuff on an enemy at the earliest opportunity, it may be wise to avoid stun-stacking if an ally has already disabled the enemy with a leading stun. Try to work down the enemy with regular attacks while they are disabled, and then cast Infernal Blade in order to impede them once they are able to act.<br/><h4>Doom</h4>Doom is often considered the most powerful single-target disable in the game, as it silences and mutes its target for at least 15 seconds. Used on the proper enemy, it can convert any 5-vs.-5 fight into an uneven 4-vs.-5 fight.<br/><br/>Doom is an extremely powerful ganking spell, since it prevents the target from casting spells or using items, rendering them completely helpless. If Doom can be used to pick off one of the enemy's strongest heroes alone, it can give Doom's team a numerical advantage even before a teamfight happens, discouraging the enemy from engaging at all.<br/><br/>Be mindful that Doom's ultimate has a 0.5 second cast animation, longer than his standard cast animation of 0.3 seconds. This can allow particularly reactive enemies to dodge or evade Doom as he attempts to cast the spell, so the element of surprise is very important in allowing Doom to get the spell off. If possible, try to get a teammate with strong initiating abilities and items disable key enemy targets first, so that they cannot react to Doom coming within range to cast his ultimate.<br/><br/>The strongest counters to Doom are Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb, which can cause the ultimate to be entirely wasted or even reflected back to Doom himself. If possible, try to break an enemy Linken's Sphere with a cheap unit-targeted ability first, either from an item or a creep ability obtained through Devour. Teammates can also help Doom by using their cheap unit-targeted abilities to break a Linken's Sphere for him.<br/><br/>In teamfights, Doom should generally be targeted on the biggest threat on the enemy team, as preventing them from participating in a teamfight can greatly tip the odds in your team's favor. However, the biggest threat may not always be the enemy's hard carry, so use your best judgment.<br/><br/>The target that you choose for Doom is extremely important, as the huge 15 second duration can render spell-dependent heroes such as Zeus or Lina absolutely useless. As well, if you can catch an enemy hero carrying key support items like Mekansm or Pipe of Insight, you can prevent those items from being used during the subsequent fight, all the more so if they are being carried by a hero that has powerful teamfight contribution spells, killing two birds with one stone.<br/><br/>Beware that when enemies drop below 25% of their maximum HP, they can be denied by their teammates, preventing Doom and his team from gaining the gold or experience bounty. Additionally, Doom is not guaranteed to kill enemies that break off from a fight, and they can potentially limp away at low health and survive. If the goal is to kill the Doomed target, try to prevent them from escaping in order to prevent any of the two situations from happening.<br/><br/>Conversely, remember that once an enemy is Doomed, they lose much of their ability to contribute during an engagement. If the goal is to win a teamfight, the Doomed target can be ignored and their teammates should be focused on and killed, allowing Doom's team to kill the Doomed enemy at their leisure and take map objectives once the rest of the enemy team is defeated.<br/><br/>When considering purchasing Aghanim's Scepter, keep in mind that it is best purchased only if the break can be utilized effectively. If the enemy lineup has strong threatening heroes with troublesome passive abilities such as Phantom Assassin, Bristleback and Spectre, applying a break on them can greatly reduce the threat they pose to your team. However, not building an Aghanim's Scepter lets you use the gold and inventory slot to build a different item, which may counter enemy heroes in a better way.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are important basic regen items to have. Since Doom is a melee hero, he is easy to harass during the laning stage, so having regen can allow him to remain in-lane.<br/><br/>Stout Shield gives Doom damage block, which is useful both in lane and while jungling, particularly because of his extremely low base armor.<br/><br/>Iron Branches are cheap and give Doom some all-around attributes. They can be sold later for inventory space at little cost, or used to build into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>In general, a Clarity or two are recommended during the laning stage, and especially if jungling, as Doom's abysmal base intelligence means that he runs completely out of mana after casting less than a handful of spells.<br/><br/>Iron Talon is a very powerful farming booster for Doom that can allow him to accelerate his farming speed as needed. It boosts his damage against creeps while also providing armor, increasing his physical damage resistance whether it is against creeps or heroes. Using the active on creeps can greatly reduce the amount of time Doom takes to clear a creep camp, and in particular can instantly reduce any neutral creep's health so that Devour can completely digest them before it comes off cooldown.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick provides burst health and mana regen that can often be enough to save Doom's life. As Doom has very low base intelligence, a full-charge Magic Stick can easily replenish more than half of his mana pool in the early game, giving him the mana to cast most of his spells.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are important to get early on all heroes. For Doom, increasing his base movement speed increases his mobility with Scorched Earth, allowing him to chase down or outrun enemies more easily.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives Doom more armor, vastly alleviating one of his early weaknesses, and gives him some flat mana regen that is very useful on him early on due to his low base intelligence.<br/><br/>Wind Lace allows Doom to gank enemy heroes more effectively in the early game, and may be upgraded later on into a Drum of Endurance.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots give Doom more last-hitting power, allowing him to farm more easily, and gives him a mobility active that can be used alongside Scorched Earth. Mobility is important on Doom as he must be quick to get within range to cast Doom at the right time in ganks and teamfights.<br/><br/>Hand of Midas is very good item for any role Doom as he can get lots of early gold from Devour to be able to afford it early on.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is powerful on Doom for all the same reasons as Magic Stick. The increased attributes make him stronger in all areas, and the greater charge storage allows Doom to replenish much more health and mana. A full-charge Magic Wand can give Doom enough mana to cast any one of his spells as needed.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a good mid-game item for Doom that can be built from an already-purchased Ring of Basilius. It gives Doom more armor, health and mana regen, lifesteal to maintain his health pool, and bonus physical damage. The aura gives his team a bigger edge in teamfights, increasing their overall strength.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is mandatory on all heroes. Doom's ultimate makes him a strong ally to have in any engagement due to his ability to completely disable an enemy for an extended period of time.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Shadow Blade improves Doom's physical damage output, helping him deal damage in fights or farm more efficiently. The active allows Doom to invisibly initiate on enemies while dealing backstab damage prior to casting his ultimate, or can be used as an escape ability as needed.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a good all-around stat booster that has an easy buildup and lets Doom participate more often in early fights. It provides more health, a bigger mana pool, and an aura that increases attack and movement speed to boost his team's mobility and damage output.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is a strong item on Doom that solves his armor and attack speed issues, giving him and his team increased physical damage output during fights.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity grants Doom a versatile active ability to avoid incoming enemy spells, temporarily disable an enemy, or trigger Linken's Sphere. It also boosts Doom's movement speed which is important for successfully closing-in on enemies and using Infernal Blade. Doom also has low base Intelligence so the INT boost and mana regen from this item is appreciated.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard rectifies Doom's low base intelligence, allowing him to cast his spells much more often, while simultaneously alleviating his armor problem. The active can be used in a teamfight to debilitate enemies' movements, and is powerful when chasing enemies down.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a very useful initiating item on Doom, as he can use it to quickly get within range to disable enemies using any abilities he has gained via the use of Devour, as well as his ultimate. It greatly improves his mobility, allowing him to move around the map or position himself for casting spells more easily.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is a very strong item on Doom, as it augments his already impressive strength growth. Once he has sufficient armor, bulking up his health can make him much harder to kill in teamfights, allowing him to outlast the enemy. The passive health regen allows him to completely recover his health pool outside of battle, which lets him be much more active.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter drastically improves the disabling power of Doom's ultimate, as it allows him to Break enemies rather than simply silencing and muting them, preventing them from contributing at all. Since the debuff does not count down in Doom's presence, it is guaranteed that an enemy is forced out of the fight, turning it into a 4-vs.-5 engagement. The countdown prevention also increases the spell's chances of killing its target if they linger in the area for too long after being afflicted by Doom.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is a powerful complement to Doom's ultimate, as it allows him to remove two enemy players from a teamfight, drastically tipping the odds in his team's favor. However, due to Doom's low intelligence and the high mana cost of refreshing cooldowns, Doom should increase the size of his mana pool before attempting to purchase this.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd can give Doom increased survivability against physical damage by giving him more health as well as evasion against auto-attacks, helping to offset his armor vulnerability. The active is also powerful in eliminating a target's ability to attack, a powerful complement to his ultimate if the target decides to stand their ground and fight.<br/><br/>Radiance turns Doom into a walking hazard, as it inflicts burn damage to all nearby enemies (as well as stacking with Scorched Earth), and augments his attack damage. The Burn also induces a blind on all nearby enemies, causing them to miss some attacks and giving Doom more survivability against physical attacks.<br/><br/><br/>It is possible to build any type of boots on Doom, as his flexibility allows him to be played in many different ways.<br/>Arcane Boots is usually a good pickup on a support Doom, as his low base intelligence often limits his ability to cast spells or use active abilities on items. It also can be upgraded into Guardian Greaves later.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots can be powerful to get on a support Doom, however, it is also powerful on a roaming Doom who wishes to play aggressively early on and can give him a powerful early-game advantage even as a carry. The armor drastically increases his early-game survivability, while the increased movement speed can allow him to chase down enemies quickly, especially once combined with Scorched Earth. Finally, the health regen allows him to recover health between fights, allowing him to quickly prepare for another gank.<br/><br/>Power Treads can be useful for giving Doom good physical damage output due to the extra attack speed, and the extra attributes allow him to increase the size of his health or mana pools depending on what is needed. Treads are a powerful alternative to Phase Boots in any situation.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel can free up an inventory slot to allow Doom to get a full six slots of core items. It additionally improves his mobility, both through increased base movement speed and higher bonus through Scorched Earth.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blade Mail is a powerful mid-game item that gives Doom many powerful benefits. The increased intelligence greatly offsets his low base mana pool, the armor alleviates his weakness to physical damage, and the active works alongside his huge health pool to punish the enemy should they decide to attack him.<br/><br/>Vanguard can greatly offset Doom's vulnerability to physical damage, and make him much beefier overall. It is a useful mid-game item that can be upgraded into a powerful utility item.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is a decent mid-game item on Doom, as it gives him armor as well as many useful stats. It greatly increases his attack power and survivability, and the health loss from Unholy Strength can be negated by Scorched Earth.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can be extremely important to get on Doom, so that he can prevent himself from being chain-disabled and killed before getting his ultimate off. As well, once he gets farmed enough he needs to prevent himself from being disabled in teamfights so that he can take the enemy team head-on.<br/><br/>Moon Shard greatly increases Doom's attack speed, giving him much more damage output with his physical attacks. The increased night vision also gives him better situational awareness, allowing him to spot enemies farther out in order to initiate on them with Doom. It can also be purchased as a seventh-slot item and consumed to give Doom a permanent attack speed bonus, given his ability to quickly farm using Devour.<br/><br/>Silver Edge, upgraded from a purchased Shadow Blade, gives Doom more damage output and health, and increases his initiating potential by allowing him to deal more backstab damage and inflict break on enemies prior to casting Doom. Its break can also be used alongside that of an Aghanim's-upgraded Doom to debilitate two enemies simultaneously.<br/><br/>Mjollnir can be a good item to build to give Doom enough attack speed to offset his low agility growth. Using the active on yourself can discourage the enemy from focusing you down for fear of proccing Static Charge. It is a powerful complement to Doom's tankiness once he has enough armor and health.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is a powerful all-around stat booster, giving Doom more health, mana, armor and attack speed, to make him a much bigger threat to the enemy team. The attack modifier allows Doom to greatly slow enemies, and gives him a strong mobility advantage when combined with Scorched Earth.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is an unorthodox item to build on Doom, but can be a powerful hybrid caster-survivability item. It greatly improves Doom's health and mana, giving him more survivability and casting power, while the cooldown reduction allows him to apply Infernal Blade's debuff and interrupt enemies more frequently in fights and reduces his ultimate's cooldown to allow it to be used more regularly. The spell lifesteal also greatly increases Doom's survivability, as he can lifesteal off of Infernal Blade's scaling damage, Scorched Earth and Doom in the middle of battle.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade can be useful to get on Doom once he has built enough attack speed to increase the chances of proccing a bash, as it greatly increases the strength of his attacks while also providing some strength to increase his health and base damage. The active ability can also be used to instantly disable a target, through spell immunity if needed.<br/><br/><br/>Doom's flexibility allows him to be played as a non-core hero as well, as he can contribute to teamfights with his ultimate alone. His ability to farm with Devour allows him to build items even when not given farm priority.<br/>Mekansm is a useful item on a support-utility Doom, as it gives him stats across the board and a respectable amount of armor. The active also heals Doom himself and teammates, however, its high mana cost means that Doom must increase the size of his mana pool if he decides to purchase this.<br/><br/>Necronomicon can be a good item to get on Doom due to the increased intelligence and strength it provides, increasing the size of Doom's mana and health pools, respectively. The summoned warriors give increased contribution in teamfights, and they can benefit from Scorched Earth's healing as well.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard is a good utility item that vastly increases Doom's survivability against physical damage. The active ability can further protect all teammates from physical damage for some time as well.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives Doom a much bigger mana pool, good mana regen, good stats across the board and a ranged hard-disable that is a powerful complement to his ultimate. It is also useful on a carry Doom due to the Hex alone.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves greatly improves Doom's overall survivability, as its aura can make him much harder to bring down at low health. The active is very powerful in teamfights for healing and replenishing mana, and can remove debuffs from Doom himself.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dragon Knight is a durable front-line carry who can transform into a dragon and wipe out enemies with ranged projectile attacks. His heavy armor and regeneration from Dragon Blood makes him tankier than most carries, especially in the early game. If his team gains the upper hand, Dragon Knight's presence often ensures continued domination with little chance of enemy comeback. With a Shadow Blade, Dragon Knight can make a decent ganker due to Dragon Tail and its long stun duration. While resilient, Dragon Knight's damage output depends heavily on his dragon form, and can be rather useless if caught while it's on cooldown. Dragon Knight is also quite slow, and has no mobility skills.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Heavy armor against physical attacks.<br/><br/>High health regeneration.<br/><br/>Instant cast animations.<br/><br/>Strong splash damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow movement speed.<br/><br/>Very dependent on his ultimate.<br/><br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Dragon Knight is one of the few heroes with no cast time on his abilities, so abilities can be cast in between attacks on the backswing animation.<br/><br/>Creep stacking is a good tactic for Dragon Knight, as his ultimate will clear camps quickly.<br/><br/>Dragon Knight has a quick, clean attack animation, making last hitting fairly easy (especially with a Quelling Blade).<br/><br/>With any source of lifesteal, Dragon Knight rarely needs to return to the fountain.<br/><br/>In the early game, enemies teams may choose to ignore Dragon Knight during teamfights, due to his low damage.<br/><br/>Dragon Knight's item build varies depending on what he's facing. Good players must analyze enemies' items to make an informed decision.<br/><br/>Despite being tanky against physical damage, Dragon Knight has no defenses against magical and pure damage. Don't overestimate his tankiness against a mixed lineup of heroes.<br/><br/>Like several other carries, Dragon Knight relies heavily on Black King Bar to keep himself from being disabled in teamfights.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Breathe Fire</h4>Breathe Fire can be used to farm and harass in lane, especially if Dragon Knight has a Soul Ring.<br/><br/>Breathe Fire is useful as an early game nuke, being your damage source until you can unleash heavy auto attacks.<br/><br/>Breathe Fire reduces enemies attack damage.<br/><h4>Dragon Tail</h4>Dragon Tail is the longest (guaranteed) level 1 single target stun in the game. Mirana's Sacred Arrow can stun up to 5 seconds at level 1, but must travel at least 1500 range and as such is difficult to hit with.<br/><br/>Dragon Tail scales poorly. One or two levels is often enough to fulfill its primary stun purposes.<br/><br/>Dragon Tail is great for ganking, especially if you have Shadow Blade.<br/><br/>Dragon Tail's cast range increases as you transform yourself into a Dragon.<br/><h4>Dragon Blood</h4>Max it first as it can keep you alive longer. It is a must skill when playing in offlane.<br/>Restores 180/360/540/720 (360/720/1080/1440 with Talents) health in one minute.<br/><br/><h4>Elder Dragon Form</h4>Despite its long duration, make sure Elder Dragon Form is always ready before a teamfight. Without it, Dragon Knight is easily kited.<br/><br/>Elder Dragon Form changes attack range from melee to ranged. Keep this in mind when building items as it also changes the effect of items like Manta Style, damage block, bash chance and cleave.<br/><br/>The Dragons' corrosive breath affects towers, easily taking them down.<br/><br/>Use the Splash damage from the Level 2 Red Dragon to clean waves and stacked camps. A Helm of the Dominator is usually bought for this job.<br/><br/>Frost Breath and Corrosive Breath are not unique attack modifiers, so they are stackable with items granting unique attack modifiers.<br/><br/>The splash damage will not trigger lifesteal.<br/><br/>However, if the attack modifier increases the attack damage, it will affect splash (both Corrosive Breath and Frost Breath are applied to all units damaged by splash), and so does critical strikes. Splash damage is also affected by damage manipulation.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango. One is usually enough, as Dragon Blood can keep him in lane with minimum health regeneration.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade makes last hitting easier, which is very important for a carry.<br/><br/>Clarity is needed because of Dragon Knight's poor mana pool.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength grant more health, and can be used to build a Bracer.<br/><br/>Iron Branch gives nice attributes, and can be used to build a Magic Wand.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are compulsory because of the early speed boost they give.<br/><br/>Magic Stick provides you with some regeneration while laning.<br/><br/>Bracer is a good early game item: it gives more attributes and some damage.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is a useful item on Dragon Knight, as it allows him to farm using Breathe Fire constantly. The extra health regeneration from Soul Ring together with the regeneration from Dragon Blood offset the health loss.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads are useful not only because of the attack speed they give, but also because you can switch the attribute to Intelligence if you need more mana, usually just before using an ability; otherwise you can keep them on Strength to make you more durable and to make last hitting easier.<br/><br/>Magic Wand provides you with more attributes and good health and mana regeneration. Also, it uses up the branches bought earlier, making room for more items while keeping their stats.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is a crucial item to have in most games to prevent being disabled. With the added survivability, damage and magic immunity, you become more durable and able to jump into the fight with less risk of dying.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is the best item to buy if you need to be tankier. Not only does it provide you with a massive HP boost and a passive ability to gain health more quickly, but it also adds 45 damage.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a good item both offensively and defensively: it gives more damage, more strength and some evasion. Its maim is nice for chasing enemies, and its disarm is a nice counter to auto-attackers and carries.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade gives good mobility, and is a favorite for ganking players. The stealth allows you to initiate using your stun, and the bonus damage coming out of stealth is also helpful.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator gives attack speed, +4 to all stats and extra HP regen, as well as an aura which helps increase your team's durability. Due to the changes in 7.00, it no longer builds into Satanic so isn't a core item anymore.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger assists with Dragon Knight's mobility problem and allows him to initiate with Dragon Tail.<br/>However, if your team already has an initiator and you do not need to initiate, Sange and Yasha works just as well and provides more durability.<br/><br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian gives damage, attack speed, and a nice boost in strength when activated; significantly increasing Dragon Knight's carry potential. His HP regen from Dragon Blood also assists in negating the Armlet HP degeneration. Armlet is also good in conjunction with Satanic, allowing DK to become an extremely durable carry.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass gives attack speed and armor to you and surrounding allies. It also places a debuff on enemies, making them easier to kill. It is a good item if you have many auto-attackers in your team.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight give more survivability and tankiness for both you and your team against magic damage, the bonus health regen is also very useful.<br/><br/>Maelstrom and its upgrade Mjollnir supplements Dragon Knight's damage output and provides a useful deterrent against attacking enemies.<br/><br/>Satanic grants a sizeable strength boost, as well as damage and 20% lifesteal, significantly increasing Dragon Knight's survivability. A good item to build if using an Armlet of Mordiggian<br/><br/>Daedalus makes you deal more damage, and gives you the chance to make critical hits.<br/><br/>Desolator improves Dragon Knight's tower pushing and increases his damage. It also synergizes with an Assault Cuirass pickup and creates a huge armor disparity.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha provides you with more strength, more agility, more damage and more attack speed. Other than this, the added movement speed and its greater maim make chasing enemies easier.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi provides a slow that stacks with lifesteal from Satanic and Mask of Madness. It also pierces spell immunity, like the Frost Breath from your level 3 Dragon Form. Cold Attack combined with Frost Breath reduces an enemy's damage output significantly and makes it hard for enemy heroes to disengage from a fight once they are attacked by Dragon Knight. It also provides a huge health boost rivaling Heart of Tarrasque and can be considered as an offense oriented replacement as it also provides intelligence that helps with your mana consumption, and agility which gives attack speed for more DPS and armor that increases your overall effective health.<br/><br/>Moon Shard can be considered as a final luxury when your team is far ahead.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Earth Spirit is one of the strongest disabling heroes in the game, possessing a stun, silence and slow in all of his basic abilities, allowing him to combo his abilities based on the needs of his allies and how he wants to affect his enemies. By judiciously using his spells at the right time and in the right situation, he can inflict the enemy with powerful crowd control effects.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very dangerous roaming presence.<br/><br/>Performs role well without items.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Requires precise positioning and timing.<br/><br/>Mediocre lane presence if not playing aggressively.<br/><br/>Somewhat level dependent.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Due to the high potential impact of his spells, Earth Spirit is a relatively farm-independent hero, and can contribute greatly to ganks and teamfights with few to no items. He is best played as a utility initiator that can be useful without items but increases greatly in effectiveness with farm.<br/><br/>Earth Spirit has little single-target physical damage, and his spells require the use of Stone Remnants in order to be effective. As such, it is difficult to farm with him, so he should get his gold by being active and getting kills and assists in teamfights and ganks.<br/><br/>Positioning is key with Earth Spirit; this hero is adept at initiating, counter-initiating and running down fleeing foes. All of his spells allow him to disable enemies in some form or another, so being within range to cast his spells can allow him to turn the tide of any teamfight.<br/><br/>Earth Spirit can generally be played in numerous roles, depending on what is needed by his team.<br/>Most commonly, Earth Spirit is played as a solo off-laner, as he possesses survivability due to being a strength hero and has an escape in Rolling Boulder. Getting solo experience in the off-lane allows him to get fast early levels, which in turn allows him to use his abilities to devastate his opponents and greatly disrupt the enemy's safe lane. He can then transition into roaming and ganking with his spells.<br/><br/>As a roamer, Earth Spirit can use his wide array of disables to set up kills on enemies in their lanes. While he will not get much farm or experience, he can appear without warning in any enemy lane and disable enemies for kills, giving his teammates strong lane advantages.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Boulder Smash</h4>Boulder Smash is a powerful utility spell that allows Earth Spirit to forcibly re-position a unit while dealing damage, or launch a Stone Remnant to stun and deal damage over great distances.<br/><br/>A successfully targeted Boulder Smash with a Stone Remnant is one of the longest-ranged and fastest-moving stuns in the game. You can use it for a variety of effects despite its mediocre damage, such as canceling an enemy's teleport from a safe distance (e.g. a Naga Siren who has cast Song of the Siren, a Tinker with Boots of Travel or a Nature's Prophet hidden inside Sprout) or interrupting enemy channeling spells without endangering yourself, such as Death Ward.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Boulder Smash can be cast on allies as well as enemies, not just Stone Remnants. It can be used to help an ally initiate, or to forcibly displace an enemy in a direction favorable to your team. However, keep in mind that a Boulder Smash cast on a unit has a relatively short travel distance and will not stun any enemies in its path. It also will not interrupt the targeted unit, so it won't cancel channeling spells this way.<br/><br/>When ganking or solo-killing a target, it is often beneficial to keep Boulder Smash in reserve in case the target attempts to teleport out. Earth Spirit has limited physical damage output and his spells lack immediate nuking power, so holding on to your stun can allow you to prevent the target from easily escaping after being initiated on.<br/><br/>As it does not interrupt channeling when cast on an ally, Boulder Smash can be used to re-position teammates who are channeling big ultimates in teamfights (such as Death Ward and Black Hole to put them in a better position whilst the spell remains in effect. On a smaller scale, it can be used to displace an ally who is channeling a Town Portal Scroll, making them harder to locate by the enemy and buying them time to escape.<br/><h4>Rolling Boulder</h4>Rolling Boulder is a powerful mobility spell that allows Earth Spirit to initiate, escape, or simply re-position to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Leveling up Rolling Boulder only decreases its cooldown, so it is best to only take one point in the ability in the early game for mobility, and spend your skill points on your other disables and nukes, which increase in damage and duration.<br/><br/>When augmented by a Stone Remnant, Rolling Boulder increases Earth Spirit's travel speed and maximum distance, and inflicts a slow on the first enemy hero it collides with. Because the distance is fixed and the speed only changes upon hitting the Stone Remnant, it is best to place the remnant right on top of Earth Spirit, in order to minimize the travel time.<br/><br/>By utilizing the delay on Rolling Boulder, it is possible to decrease the time required to execute a Remnant-augmented roll. Cast Rolling Boulder in the desired direction, and then place the Stone Remnant in Earth Spirit's path during the delay (remember that you can double-tap Stone Remnant), instead placing the Remnant and then casting Rolling Boulder.<br/><br/>Remember that Rolling Boulder allows Earth Spirit to move up and down cliffs and through trees, so you can use it to pass over normally impassable terrain. However, keep in mind that getting disabled during the spell's 0.6 second delay will interrupt it, so be very careful about using it when fleeing enemies with stuns, roots or silences.<br/><br/>When using Rolling Boulder to initiate on a target, good aim is absolutely mandatory. The boulder only stops when it connects with an enemy hero, so if you miss and overshoot, you may wind up in an extremely disadvantageous position.<br/><br/>Remember that while you are rooted for the duration of Rolling Boulder, you may still use items (excluding Blink Dagger). For instance, Town Portal scrolls can be used without being interrupted, so they can be activated during the delay or roll, allowing Earth Spirit to start channeling an escape early and displace himself during the channeling.<br/><br/>Depending on when and where in the roll the Stone Remnant is placed, Earth Spirit moves at a net rate of 500 or 762-1000.<br/>Rolling without a Stone Remnant moves Earth Spirit 800 units in 1.6 (0.6 + 1) seconds, resulting in a net rate of 500 effective movement speed. Rolling into a Stone Remnant 949-950 distance from Earth Spirit's initial location moves him 1600 in 2.1 (0.6 + 1 + 0.5) seconds, resulting in a net rate of 762 effective movement speed. Rolling into a Stone Remnant 0-150 distance from Earth Spirit's initial location moves him 1600 in 1.6 (0.6 + 1) seconds, resulting in a net rate of 1000 effective ms.<br/><br/><h4>Geomagnetic Grip</h4>Geomagnetic Grip is an ally-targeted spell that allows Earth Spirit to pull an allied creep or Stone Remnant to his position.<br/><br/>Because Geomagnetic Grip's silence duration does not scale that well, it is best skilled up only if the longer silence duration is necessary for countering specific enemies, or if the additional magical damage is needed.<br/><br/>Remember that Geomagnetic Grip deals no damage unless a Stone Remnant is pulled. Therefore, if the aim is to deal damage, a remnant must be used.<br/><br/>When using Stone Remnants to utilize Geomagnetic Grip's silence, remember that Stone Remnants have no collision boxes. Therefore if your aim is surprise, you can place the Stone Remnant in the enemy's fog of war (inside of trees, or on an elevated cliff) and then pull it to you to avoid alerting them when they see the remnant being placed.<br/><br/>When upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, Geomagnetic Grip has great utility in saving allies who are being ganked by the enemy, as it can pull them to safety over terrain and regardless of the direction they are facing or intervening enemy units. As well, it will silence any enemies within melee range of your teammate, preventing them from casting mobility spells to pursue.<br/><h4>Stone Remnant</h4>Stone Remnant allows Earth Spirit to place a remnant within a certain radius of himself, and then use it in combination with his spells.<br/><br/>Stone Remnants are key to enhancing the effectiveness of all of Earth Spirit's spells. They should be treated as a resource more valuable than mana, as while abilities and items exist to replenish mana, none exist to increase the number of Stone Remnant charges available besides waiting for them to naturally replenish.<br/><br/>When casting your spells to farm or disable enemies in fights, remember that you can use the same Stone Remnant more than once. The Stone Remnant that you pulled to you with Geomagnetic Grip to silence an enemy can then be used to stun a distant target with Boulder Smash, or quickly re-position yourself with Rolling Boulder.<br/><br/>Stone Remnants persist on the field for up to 2 minutes, and ignore pathing and collision. If you are short on Stone Remnants but have plenty of mana, you can recycle them by moving old Stone Remnants to more advantageous positions using your spells. As well, Stone Remnants left over from previous teamfights can be improvised if another fight occurs in the same area.<br/><br/>Double-clicking on the command to place a Stone Remnant (or ALT + ability hotkey if Quickcast and Smart Double Tap are enabled) will place a Stone Remnant directly in front of Earth Spirit. This can facilitate easier casting of Boulder Smash and Rolling Boulder, and give players more time to direct their attention at enemy targets as needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tango are basic regen requirements in almost any lane that Earth Spirit is placed in.<br/><br/>Clarity potions will help Earth Spirit to cast his spells more often to make a bigger impact in the early game, as he is limited more by his mana pool than by the number of Stone Remnants he has.<br/><br/>Iron Branch is a cheap and effective way to improve Earth Spirit's stats, particularly his strength and intelligence, both of which are lacking in the early game.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is recommended when playing in the off-lane, as it will significantly reduce the amount of damage Earth Spirit takes from enemy player harass.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are essential early on for Earth Spirit, as the improved movement speed will allow him to position himself more quickly for casting his spells. It is not absolutely necessary to upgrade them immediately, which can save you gold for other items.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a useful pickup when in a lane against heroes who are harassing you by spamming low mana cost spells. In particular, your low early mana pool means that you will greatly benefit from having an extra source of mana regen for casting your spells if you're in a pinch.<br/><br/>Bottle is essential if Earth Spirit is played in the mid lane, but can also be a handy source of regen if playing as a roamer or off-laner. As Earth Spirit is very mobile and very active, a Bottle will give him health regen between ganks and fights, and the mana replenishment will recover a sizable fraction of his mana pool, allowing him to stay on the go.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Force Staff has many uses for a hero like Earth Spirit, and can be built relatively easily as its components aren't that expensive. It can be used to quickly re-position Earth Spirit in order to more easily cast his abilities, as well as escape from failed fights or ganks. As well, the active can be used to save nearby allies, or disposition enemies for your spells. It also improves his mana pool, always good on a strength caster, and the health regen helps keep him at full health as needed.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is useful for the same reason as Magic Stick, as well as for the additional stats if you are not a core farmer on your team.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good pickup on very active Earth Spirit players since he is very powerful in teamfights and ganks, and is a strength hero who can benefit from additional mana regeneration. The active ability can be used to heal teammates after ganks or teamfights, or can add an additional 150 pure damage to an enemy during a gank. Remember to check with teammates to see if any of them are purchasing one as well, as only one Urn will receive charges when a nearby enemy hero dies.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is an essential basic item that all heroes should carry at all times, but is doubly so on Earth Spirit. Because of his mobility and powerful disables, being able to show up quickly to a gank, counter-gank teamfight is critical.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots are almost essential on Earth Spirit if no other mana regen items are built. As a strength caster, he benefits greatly from the larger mana pool, as well as the mana replenishment given upon activation. Arcane Boots also greatly benefit your team, especially if your allies are having mana issues.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is helpful if your team has multiple spell casters. It provides a large amount of intelligence to improve Earth Spirit's mana pool, and the extra armor is very useful as he often gets right in the middle of battles when initiating. The 25% magic resistance reduction on enemies works well with all of Earth Spirit's spells, but synergizes best with his ultimate, Magnetize, as Magic Weakness' long debuff duration can stay in place throughout refreshing Magnetize on enemies.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is useful against the enemies which rely on their attacks. The disarm will render the targeted hero unable to attack, making most hard carries useless until the effect wears off. Heaven's Halberd will also give Earth Spirit extra health, attack damage, and evasion, all helpful for staying alive in fights.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is useful in most situations, but especially against a team of casters. The extra magic resistance helps keep Earth Spirit alive during initiations, and the active protects all allies from magical damage for a short period of time. As well, the additional health regen allows Earth Spirit to remain out in the field for longer without having to return to base to heal.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque will massively increase Earth Spirit's survivability, granting him over 1000 bonus health and very fast health regeneration between fights which will allow him to start every teamfight or gank at full health. This survivability allows Earth Spirit to stand in the center of fights, making it easier to deal damage with Magnetize. If all goes well, Earth Spirit can place more Stone Remnants, refreshing the duration of his ultimate with a much smaller risk of dying.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse greatly improves Earth Spirit's mana pool, as well as giving him some overall attribute improvement. The ability to hex an enemy target is extremely useful, as it can disable a key target instantly and eliminate their evasion and ability to use items, giving you and your team time to disable them further.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a useful mid-game item that gives Earth Spirit many positive benefits. The intelligence shores up his small mana pool, the armor gives him survivability against physical damage, and the attack damage gives him more physical damage output which helps him farm late-game items more easily as needed. But most importantly, using the item's active ability while initiating can discourage the enemy from attacking you, giving you more time to cast your spells as needed.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard greatly increases Earth Spirit's physical survivability as well as the size of his mana pool. The active ability can be used in conjunction with initiating a teamfight with Rolling Boulder, as you can apply the blast to the entire enemy team almost instantly, slowing them down enough to catch them all with Magnetize.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is an extremely powerful item to purchase on Earth Spirit, as it will allow him to position himself much more easily for casting his spells and has a very short cooldown. As it costs no mana to cast, you can use it without worrying about not having enough mana to cast your spells.<br/><br/>Mekansm improves Earth Spirit's already good armor and health regeneration, and is a good utility pickup for your team. Keep in mind though, it has an extremely high mana cost, more than any of your other spells, so it is necessary to increase the size of your mana pool first. If you don't, you may render yourself unable to cast your other spells after healing your team, or healing your team after pulling off your spell combo. Remember to check whether a teammate is going to purchase Mekansm, as a team only needs one.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter unlocks a new ability, Enchant Remnant, which greatly increases Earth Spirit's ability to disable enemies, save teammates, and initiate during teamfights and ganks. It also augments Geomagnetic Grip so that it can be cast on allied heroes.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a very powerful early-game purchase on Earth Spirit. Using his basic attacks to slow enemies' movement speed synergizes well with all of his other disables, greatly improving his ability to set up kills for his team.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a cheap utility item can make Earth Spirit highly elusive and give him additional initiation power that augments his already strong mobility. The active can allow him to initiate invisibly, cloak himself for escapes when combined with Rolling Boulder, or give him strong magic resistance when jumping in during teamfights. It also allows him to do the same for allies, and synergizes with his ability to save teammates by pulling them from harm using Geomagnetic Grip.<br/><br/>Aether Lens greatly augments Earth Spirit's disable potential and is a great utility item to build in many situations, in particular as it can be cheaply assembled by using the Energy Booster from Arcane Boots. Besides the additional mana, it provides HP regen which aids in survivability and allows Earth Spirit to roam independently. The cast range increase affects all of Earth Spirit's spells, extending the reach of his disables, and the spell damage amp can help him to deal more damage with his nukes.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity can be useful to build in situations where farming a more expensive item is prohibitive. It improves Earth Spirit's mana pool and regeneration, ensuring that he will always have the mana to cast his spells, and the extra movement speed allows him to move into position for his spells more easily without resorting to using a Blink Dagger or Force Staff. As well, the active cyclone can be used to make yourself temporarily invulnerable while also dispelling debuffs such as silences, or instantly disable an enemy to set up your other spells.<br/><br/>Solar Crest gives Earth Spirit strong resistance against physical damage. As a strength hero with innately high HP, giving him armor and evasion makes him harder to kill in fights, while the passive mana regen keeps his mana pool topped up. The active can be used on allies or enemies, giving Earth Spirit even more utility beyond his already potent disables.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard is a useful utility item to pick up on Earth Spirit if the enemy has lots of physical damage output. As a melee hero the damage block is very effective, while the increased health pool makes him much more durable while initiating. The active will also allow you to give a large amount of physical damage protection to your allies, as even ranged heroes will get full damage block for the duration of the buff.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb protects Earth Spirit from targeted spells, or allows him to share that protection with allies. The item provides HP and mana regen, as well as armor and additional bonus damage.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves can drastically improve Earth Spirit's survivability when initiating teamfights. When upgraded from Arcane Boots and Mekansm, it removes Mekansm's mana cost while providing Earth Spirit with a strong teamfight aura and a self-dispel to remove debuffs from himself.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Earthshaker is a powerful spellcaster designed to repeatedly stun enemies. However, his naturally low mana requires careful management and selective use, especially during the early game. His Echo Slam allows him to wipe out large groups of enemies, making him an ideal pick against heroes like Chaos Knight, Meepo, Broodmother, or Phantom Lancer. Compared to intelligence supports, Earthshaker has a sizeable health pool. But compared to most strength heroes, Earthshaker is fairly vulnerable and can be easily killed if caught out of position.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Numerous stuns.<br/><br/>Excellent initiation.<br/><br/>Good early ganking.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>Long cast animations.<br/><br/>Easy to harass in lane.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Due to his costly abilities, Earthshaker needs good timing and game sense to be effective.<br/><br/>In the early game, Earthshaker is very easy to harass in lane. Players should play conservatively except when setting up a gank with his allies.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fissure</h4>At 1500 range, Fissure is one of the longest ranged stuns in the game.<br/><br/>Use Fissure to block off enemy retreat or reinforcements.<br/>Earthshaker is exceptional at ganking the mid lane, because at a good angle, Fissure can completely block the enemy midlaner from running back to their tower.<br/><br/><br/>Keep your finger on the Stop hotkey (S by default) to immediately cancel the cast animation if it looks like you're going to miss.<br/><br/>Fissure creates an impassable ridge and splits two adjacent heroes between the ridge.<br/>Fissure is useful for separating a fleeing ally from a pursuing enemy. This requires practice, as it is quite common to misclick and wall off both heroes on the same side.<br/><br/>The impassable terrain is effective in splitting the battlefield during a teamfight. However, improper use of Fissure can prevent melee carries from inflicting damage on or chasing the enemy.<br/><br/><br/>Fissure's long range can be used to snipe off retreating enemies.<br/><br/>Fissure has a long cast animation and may be interrupted in a hectic fight.<br/><h4>Enchant Totem</h4>Enchant Totem has a very long cast animation and can be interrupted,<br/><br/>One of Enchant Totem's main roles is to stun enemy with Aftershock. It can be used as a mini-initiation ability with Blink Dagger or its Aghanim's Scepter upgrade.<br/>Beware of its long cast animation: Enemy may simply walk out of the Aftershock radius.<br/><br/><br/>Enchant Totem has a very low cooldown, allowing Earthshaker to repeatedly return to the fight during long engagements.<br/><br/>The Enchant Totem buff lasts 14 seconds, meaning that it should be pre-cast before a fight to maximize Earthshaker's damage.<br/><br/>Enchant Totem is useful for last hitting buildings. However, if the team's carry is around, Earthshaker should yield the last hit (and therefore extra gold) to them.<br/><h4>Echo Slam</h4>For maximum damage, use Echo Slam around as many enemy units as possible.<br/><br/>Use the Aftershock stun duration from Echo Slam to follow up with other abilities.<br/><br/>It is not always best to use Echo Slam to initiate. Experienced players often stay back during fights, waiting until enemies are grouped up before jumping in.<br/>That said, some team compositions are very dependent on Earthshaker to initiate. Use sensible judgment.<br/><br/><br/>A well placed Echo Slam is one of the few abilities that can turn around a badly losing game.<br/><br/>There are certain positions that enemies will natually group up. This includes Roshan pit, the high ground around Tier 3 Towers, narrow paths such as river, places without vision such as uphills, or even at times when they are ganging up on a teammate.<br/><h4>Items</h4>Starting items:Tango provides health regeneration in lane.<br/><br/>Iron Branch gives basic stats and can be built into Magic Wand, also allows more regeneration from Tango.<br/><br/>Clarity potions allow him to cast Fissure's more than once, since its mana cost is relatively high and Earthshaker's mana pool is small.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should be purchased if there are no other supports on the team. However, he may need to sacrifice a few items, such as Gauntlets of Strength, or two Clarities, reducing his lane presence by a big deal.<br/><br/>Infused Raindrop provides excellent protection against magical harassment, against which Earthshaker normally has no defense.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango provides extra health regen, also an extra mana source in a pinch for an extra Fissure.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango provides health regeneration in lane.<br/><br/>Iron Branch gives basic stats and can be built into Magic Wand, also allows more regeneration from Tango.<br/><br/>Clarity potions allow him to cast Fissure's more than once, since its mana cost is relatively high and Earthshaker's mana pool is small.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should be purchased if there are no other supports on the team.

It can also be used to chase fleeing enemies to take them down with his Enchant Totem.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Blink Dagger is an indispensable item for Earthshaker to initiate with Echo Slam. It can also be used to chase fleeing enemies to take them down with his Enchant Totem.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Force Staff act as a supplement to Earthshaker's mobility, as you can initiate from even further. It can also be used to escape rough situations, especially Power Cogs.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity increases mana pool and mana regeneration. The active adds an additional disable on enemy, also purges silence for a spellcaster as Earthshaker.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter can kite enemies and buy yourself time if being constantly focused by physical attackers.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape increases Earthshaker's magical resistance. The active can help himself or ally to escape when enemy has no detection.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter allows Earthshaker to jump into fights with Enchant Totem, giving him even greater mobility. It also provides a good boost to his stats.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord can give more damage to his own abilities, and any of the allies' abilities that are affected by magic resistance.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb allows Earthshaker to use his skill one more time in teamfight, providing a theoretical 9 second chain stun in late game than can even bring down the entire team. Note that the first Echo Slam usually clear up the creep wave and summons so the second one won't be as effective if used immediately.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb gives you additional armor and regen. The active can purge debuff (especially silence) from you or your ally, also reflect all targeted spells.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse offers a hard disable which is useful in late game.<br/><br/>Daedalus increases damage output from Enchant Totem with raw damage and critical chance. It is an unorthodox build and favored by more combat-oriented Earthshaker builds.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is sometimes picked up during the late game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Elder Titan is a very flexible hero who can provide great amounts of utility to his team through his abilities, depending on how he is built. He can use Astral Spirit to accrue great amounts of bonus damage and movement speed, and then take advantage of Natural Order to inflict that bonus damage on enemies when their defenses are reduced. He is also capable of disabling multiple enemy heroes at once with a combination of Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp, as well as set up strong slows and deal tremendous damage with Earth Splitter after landing a successful Echo Stomp.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Wide area disable.<br/><br/>Anti-tank aura.<br/><br/>Can deal high physical damage as a support.<br/><br/>Good scouting ability.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Mediocre stat growths.<br/><br/>Difficult to land spells.<br/><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>Requires some micro-management.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>In general, due to being a strength melee hero, Elder Titan benefits greatly from building durability items. After increasing his tankiness, he can transition into carrying defensive auras and teamfight items, which can give his team an edge in fights.<br/><br/>Depending on your team composition and level of play, Elder Titan's skills have differing priorities to max. Level Echo Stomp to increase the sleep's duration, making it easier for Elder Titan and his team to set up their own spells without disturbance. Astral Spirit provides the highest overall damage increase in a single spell, allowing Elder Titan to deal damage from the spirit passing through enemies as well as giving him bonus damage once it returns. Maxing Natural Order early massively increases the amount of damage enemies will take in engagements, allowing high damage dealers on Elder Titan's team to maximize their damage output.<br/>If being built as a melee-range fighter, Elder Titan focuses on maxing out Astral Spirit and Natural Order, completely forgoing Echo Stomp and his ultimate to get four levels in both by level 8. By doing so, Elder Titan can cast Astral Spirit to maximize the amount of bonus damage and movement speed he gains by passing it through enemy units, and then engaging the enemy in direct combat to utilize the bonus damage and apply his Natural Order aura to enemies he is attacking to further increase the damage they take from his attacks. Because Astral Spirit is his only mana-costing ability, Elder Titan focuses on building durability items and increasing his attack speed, so that he can take the enemy head-on and maximize his damage output.<br/><br/>Built as a utility initiator-disabler, Elder Titan gets only one value point in Astral Spirit, then focuses on maxing out Echo Stomp and Natural Order, while leveling his ultimate where possible. The objective of this build is to combine Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp in order to set up long-duration sleeps on enemies, and then weaken their defenses for teammates to exploit, using his ultimate both as a nuke and a disable. Because he lacks levels in Astral Spirit, Elder Titan will have little auto-attack damage output, and focuses on using his spells to great effect. Elder Titan must build items that grant him mana for sustaining his casting, mobility to let him more easily position himself to cast his spells, and utility items to help give his team an advantage in fights.<br/><br/><br/>Elder Titan is most often played as an off-laner, but can be played as a mid hero or safe-lane support depending on the lineup.<br/>Astral Spirit allows an off-lane Elder Titan to get last-hits from distance, and he benefits from getting solo experience if the enemy supports fail to zone him out effectively. Additionally, the spirit can accrue bonus damage and movement speed via nearby jungle creeps as well as lane creeps, giving Elder Titan more mobility and last-hitting power as needed, and scout the fog of war for potential incoming ganks. A value point in Echo Stomp can serve as an emergency escape spell of sorts, as it can stop attackers in their tracks once they've expended their disables, allowing Elder Titan to escape while they are asleep.<br/><br/>A mid Elder Titan can use a combination of Astral Spirit and Natural Order to bully his opponent, as he can gain bonus damage and movement speed through the spirit to trade right-clicks and chase the enemy mid down, while Natural Order's aura greatly increases the amount of damage they take from trading attacks. As well, Echo Stomp can be used to punish any enemies attempting to tower dive, or can aid in setting up friendly ganks.<br/><br/>As a support, Elder Titan will have very little farm and experience priority, however he can remotely set up disables via Astral Spirit and Echo Stomp once he hits level 2, which can disable the enemy's off-laner long enough for his team to get in a favorable position for a gank. As well, he can transition into a utility farming support by passing his Astral Spirit through neutral camps in his jungle and then use the bonus damage to farm if needed.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Echo Stomp</h4>Echo Stomp is an unorthodox disable in that it is a sleep, rather than a stun. As such, it is mechanically very unusual but can be very strong when used properly.<br/><br/>Remember that Echo Stomp is a channeled spell, and as such stunning or silencing Elder Titan during the 1.2 second delay will interrupt it and cause the spell to fail. Because of this, Echo Stomp is best used when combined with Astral Spirit.<br/><br/>The most important aspect of Echo Stomp is that all slept units will awake immediately upon taking player-based damage. As such, it requires that allies do not attempt to attack or cast spells against the enemy, as it will remove the disable and allow the target to act again.<br/><br/>Conversely, however, this can be used to your advantage, as damage from non-player sources will not wake the target up. This means that if an enemy hero is tower-diving or has accrued creep aggro, inflicting them with the sleep will allow towers and creeps to continue to damage them without waking them up. Additionally, this works with Roshan's damage, making Echo Stomp a very strong spell for countering Roshan attempts by the enemy team.<br/><br/>Used properly, Echo Stomp is a very strong initiating spell, as it can sleep multiple enemies for up to 5 seconds, a duration comparable to the longest disables in the game. As well, it can be a very strong counter-initiation spell, breaking up enemy ganks by interrupting them as they are distracted trying to kill an ally.<br/><br/>If you manage to knock out multiple enemy heroes with an Echo Stomp, it is extremely important to prioritize and focus your targets. As the enemy will only awaken once the duration expires or when they take player-based damage, you can single out one enemy to focus down and kill while their teammates are still unconscious, and then clean up the remainder more easily once the sleep's duration ends. Hitting all of the enemies with player-based damage will immediately wake them up, wasting the sleep.<br/><br/>Echo Stomp can be a useful juking spell if being chased through the jungle by the enemy. Elder Titan can run around a blind corner, and then immediately begin channeling Echo Stomp. Any chasing enemies will likely not have enough time to interrupt Elder Titan upon reaching his location, and will be knocked out, allowing him to escape.<br/><br/>If attempting to combine Echo Stomp with Earth Splitter, at least 2 levels in Echo Stomp are required, as Earth Splitter takes 3.14 seconds to implode after casting. Under optimal circumstances, enemies will have only 0.54 seconds to escape the spell, and will be unable to do so once Echo Stomp is level 3 or higher.<br/><h4>Astral Spirit</h4>Astral Spirit is the lynchpin that allows Elder Titan's abilities to work together to create devastating combinations. It allows Elder Titan to cast Echo Stomp from long range, and carries his Natural Order aura as well, making it one of his strongest spells. No matter how Elder Titan is skilled, at least one early level is needed to make his abilities effective.<br/><br/>Astral Spirit spawns at a target location up to a distance of 1200 away from Elder Titan, and can then be controlled to move even further after that. This allows Elder Titan to set up Echo Stomp from very long ranges, without revealing his own position to the enemy team.<br/><br/>Remember that Astral Spirit's movement speed is set to match that of Elder Titan when he cast it. This makes building movement speed items on Elder Titan very important, as it affects not only his own mobility but that of his spirit.<br/><br/>Astral Spirit gives Elder Titan bonus damage and movement speed for a short duration after returning to him. As such, it can be a very strong spell to use against crowded enemies, as it can accrue massive amounts of bonus damage and movement speed, turning Elder Titan into a terrifying threat if he has enough attack speed to take advantage of this bonus damage.<br/><br/>In general, Astral Spirit's priority should be passing through enemy heroes if possible, as it serves three purposes. Passing the spirit through enemy heroes will accrue much more bonus damage and movement speed for Elder Titan than it will for creeps, putting the spirit on top of an enemy hero weakens them by applying Natural Order's aura to them, and it reveals their position through the fog of war, allowing nearby allies to take advantage of this knowledge and the aura.<br/><br/>Astral Spirit will accrue bonus damage and movement speed not only by passing through enemies, but neutrals as well (even spell immune ones). As such, if the opportunity presents itself, try to pass the spirit through jungle camps if possible, as they can serve as an additional source of power. The spirit also deals damage to them as it passes through, weakening them for later jungling.<br/><br/>Remember that Astral Spirit still gathers bonuses for units it passes through on its return path to Elder Titan. Because of this, it can be beneficial to re-position Elder Titan after casting the spell, so that after passing through as many creeps as it can during its duration, it can pass through even more on its return path, maximizing the bonuses gained from the spell.<br/><br/>The above can also be used to cast surprise Echo Stomps, as the spirit moves at 600 speed when returning, faster than Elder Titan himself can move. After casting Astral Spirit, maneuver it through the fog of war and behind the enemy, then return it so that it paths over the enemy on its return path to Elder Titan. When it reaches the enemy's position, begin channeling Echo Stomp, and the spirit will stop and begin casting it on top of the enemy. This can be a very rude surprise for enemy players, who will usually be looking in the wrong direction and not expect the Astral Spirit to be moving so quickly, let alone stop in the middle of a return.<br/><h4>Natural Order</h4>Even though it has no visual effect, Natural Order is one of Elder Titan's strongest abilities, as it can nullify base armor and counteract base magic resistance on enemy heroes, making even the toughest enemies much squishier.<br/><br/>Both Elder Titan and his Astral Spirit carry this aura. However, keep in mind that the aura has a very small radius, so in practical terms it is only useful when Elder Titan himself is engaging a foe or his spirit is on top of them.<br/><br/>Natural Order makes Elder Titan a very strong hero to counter agility-based carries. As most agility carries will build agility items to boost their base damage and attack speed, they will also have unusually high amounts of base armor, which is nullified by Natural Order. As well, agility carries will normally have small health pools, making them weak against magic nukes, which Natural Order also amplifies through its magic resistance reduction.<br/><br/>Depending on how Elder Titan is built, players should make use of the aura on either Elder Titan, his Astral Spirit, or both. As Elder Titan fights enemies, his teammates should focus down any enemies he engages, or any enemies that are standing inside his Astral Spirit. Try to micro-manage the Astral Spirit to put it on top of high-priority targets, in order to weaken their defenses from a distance if Elder Titan himself cannot reach them.<br/><h4>Earth Splitter</h4>Earth Splitter is an extremely strong damage spell that has a long delay but a wide area of effect. Casting it successfully can severely weaken the entire enemy team and slow them down tremendously, allowing teammates to mop up.<br/><br/>In general, Earth Splitter is best used once the enemy team has been knocked out by Echo Stomp, as the sleep's duration allows the ultimate to run its full course. However, it can also be used if the enemy has been disabled by a teammate, such as through Ravage, Black Hole, Chronosphere or Reverse Polarity.<br/><br/>Always remember to place your Astral Spirit and Elder Titan himself in close proximity of the enemy when the crack implodes, in order to apply the Natural Order debuff to them. This will ensure that the enemy will take almost the full brunt of the damage, and places Elder Titan in a favorable position to begin attacking the enemy using bonus damage from Astral Spirit, as they will be severely slowed as well.<br/><br/>Due to its wide area and long range, Earth Splitter can be a strong chasing spell, as it can force enemy players to path differently in order to avoid the damage and slow. As well, in emergencies it can be used as an escape spell by casting it in a direction and then running down the length of the crack, forcing enemies to break off or be damaged and slowed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items</b><br/>Tangos and Healing Salve are minimum health regen requirements. They should be purchased in order to offset any harass damage you take.<br/><br/>Clarity is useful because Elder Titan's spells are quite costly, and casting one or two spells will drain a significant portion of it. As such, having mana regen can allow you to cast more than just three spells before running dry.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is very useful on Elder Titan, as he has decent strength and armor, and is a melee hero who can get easily harassed when walking up for last-hits.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early items</b><br/>Boots of Speed are essential early on for Elder Titan, especially in the off-lane. It serves the primary purpose of allowing him to evade ganks by the enemy supports, but also allows him to get in position for his spells more quickly. As well, it improves the mobility of Astral Spirit, which is based on Elder Titan's own movement speed.<br/><br/>Magic Stick allows Elder Titan to benefit from burst HP and mana regen. In emergency situations, a full-charge Magic Stick can allow Elder Titan to cast any of his non-ultimate spells one more time, and can allow him to cast his ultimate provided that he is not completely out of mana.<br/><br/>Bracer gives Elder Titan useful stats, particularly strength for more health and base damage. It can build into a Drum of Endurance later on.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items</b><br/>Power Treads gives Elder Titan many strong benefits. Treads switching allows him to give himself more intelligence to reduce the strain that casting places on his mana pool, or strength for more HP and base damage. As well, the additional attack speed allows Elder Titan to better take advantage of any damage he gains from Astral Spirit.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance, upgraded from a previously purchased Bracer, gives Elder Titan useful stats across the board as well as an aura that provides movement and attack speed. The aura, as well as its active component, give Elder Titan an edge in teamfights, especially when combined with the bonuses provided by Astral Spirit.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is very strong on Elder Titan, as it provides him with stats and a way to instantly replenish HP and mana. As Elder Titan is extremely reliant on casting, restoring 255 mana instantly can allow him to do much more in fights.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is mandatory on all heroes. For Elder Titan, being able to use his abilities to help in ganks, counter-ganks and teamfights can be instrumental to victory.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items</b><br/>Crimson Guard is very strong on Elder Titan, as the damage block, armor and additional HP all combine to make him very tanky and hard to bring down. The utility that its active brings to a fight allows him to increase the survivability of his team against physical damage.<br/><br/>Hood of Defiance provides Elder Titan with protection against magic nukes, allowing him to stand in teamfights and make the most of Natural Order against the enemy. It can be upgraded into a Pipe of Insight to provide utility for his team, protecting them against magic nukes as well.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd serves as a utility and survivability item that increases Elder Titan's offensive potential. The strength and evasion give Elder Titan increased survivability against physical right-clicks, while the strength and damage bonus increase the power of his own right-clicks, adding a Lesser Maim on top that can slow his foes down. The active ability, Disarm, can also be used against the enemy's main carry, preventing them from attacking for some time.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass shares strong synergy with Elder Titan's spells, on top of the physical survivability it grants. The attack speed allows Elder Titan to leverage any bonus damage he gains from Astral Spirit, while the armor reduction aura stacks with that of Natural Order, causing Elder Titan's attacks to hit even harder.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is a strong physical survivability item that gives Elder Titan more intelligence for casting spells and an active slow that greatly benefits his abilities. Slowing the enemy down can make it harder for them to escape, allowing Elder Titan to catch up and apply his Natural Order aura, or can be stacked on top of a successful Earth Splitter to keep the enemy bunched up.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a good mid-game item that gives Elder Titan many good benefits. The bonus intelligence gives him a bigger mana pool for casting spells, the extra armor gives him survivability, and the extra damage helps with his damage output for teamfights and farming. The active allows him to use his HP pool offensively, discouraging enemies from focusing him as he initiates and threatening large amounts of reflected damage against fragile burst casters.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a highly expensive luxury item but carries many strong benefits. It gives Elder Titan a targeted hard disable to use against enemies, and can be use to pin an enemy down for Echo Stomp. It greatly increases the size of his mana pool, gives him scaling mana regen, and gives him stats across the board.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb allows Elder Titan to cast his ultimate twice in quick succession, which can severely cripple any enemy it catches, potentially even killing them from full health. It is best purchased if players are confident that they will have enough setup to land Earth Splitter with precision, but requires increasing the size of Elder Titan's mana pool as the entire combination can consume up to 825 mana.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can be a good item to build on Elder Titan for various reasons. While it can prevent Elder Titan from being interrupted as he casts Echo Stomp, its primary utility is to prevent him from being disabled as he closes the distance with enemies to fight them using his bonus damage from Astral Spirit and the resistance reduction from Natural Order.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a very strong item to pick up on Elder Titan, as it gives him all-around stats that aid in his survivability and ability to cast spells. It augments the power of Earth Splitter, allowing him to slow enemies for a longer duration and disarm them at the same time, preventing them from easily retaliating.<br/><br/>Bottle can be very useful to build on Elder Titan, both as an off-laner and a mid. As Elder Titan's spells all cost a significant portion of his mana pool, being able to replenish his mana allows him to remain mobile and not have to return to base as often.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can greatly improve Elder Titan's ability to cast spells, allowing him to draw from his HP pool for mana.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a strong support item on Elder Titan. It provides him with additional armor and mana regen, giving him survivability and helping to maintain his mana pool. The active can be targeted on allies to give them more resistance to physical damage, or can be targeted on enemies to further reduce their armor alongside Natural Order, making them weaker against allied attacks, as well as Elder Titan's attacks (especially when combined with Astral Spirit) and Earth Splitter. Upgraded to Solar Crest, it can add evasion and miss chance to the mix.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger can be very situational but powerful in Elder Titan's hands. It greatly increases his mobility and allows him to position himself for casting his spells much more effectively, as well as instantly getting within range to fight.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a strong durability item on Elder Titan, and can be purchased relatively easily due to the cheap price of its components. It provides an armor aura that gives Elder Titan and his teammates more survivability against physical damage, and the damage bonus and lifesteal aura also provide strong bonuses in teamfights. The mana regen also helps to maintain Elder Titan's mana pool.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb gives Elder Titan strong utility and survivability no matter how he is built. It provides armor and HP regen, increasing his tankiness, and mana regen to fuel his spell casting. Echo Shell can be cast on an ally to discourage the enemy from casting targeted spells on them, or on Elder Titan himself to increase his survivability when directly engaging the enemy in combat.<br/><br/><br/>If attempting to take advantage of Astral Spirit and Natural Order to make Elder Titan a brawler, the following items can greatly increase his effectiveness.<br/>Orb of Venom is a good early-game item that lets Elder Titan slow enemies with his attacks. The slow can synergize with Astral Spirit's bonus damage and movement speed, letting Elder Titan easily chase enemies to land highly-damaging attacks on them.<br/><br/>Phase Boots can be a useful alternative to Power Treads, as the active can be used to chase enemies down after gaining bonus damage and movement speed via Astral Spirit.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade has good initiating utility that allows Elder Titan to more easily utilize his Astral Spirit damage. If activated after casting Astral Spirit, Elder Titan can approach enemies invisibly and attack them with the backstab damage, then recall his Astral Spirit to allow him to immediately take advantage of any bonus damage and movement speed he obtains. It can also be upgraded into a Silver Edge for all of the same benefits, as well as applying a break and damage reduction to any gank targets to further debilitate them.<br/><br/>Moon Shard greatly boosts Elder Titan's attack speed, allowing him to take advantage of any bonus damage he accrues through Astral Spirit. The increased night vision range also allows him to spot enemies from longer range, setting up ganks or disables more easily.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha greatly increases Elder Titan's early fighting potential. Increasing his attack damage, HP, attack speed and movement speed makes Elder Titan much deadlier in fights, as he can chase down enemies more effectively and deal more physical damage when combined with Astral Spirit's movement speed and bonus damage.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi vastly increases Elder Titan's attributes across the board, making him tankier and giving him more mana. The attack modifier allows him to slow enemies with his attacks, preventing them from easily running away from him and allowing him to utilize Astral Spirit's bonuses to the utmost.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Built as a utility disabler that focuses on landing Echo Stomp, Elder Titan can increase his effectiveness.<br/>Urn of Shadows is a good roaming item that gives Elder Titan increased flexibility. The bonus strength gives him base damage and more HP, while the mana regen allows him to cast his spells more regularly. Charges can be obtained easily through ganking and setting up kills with Echo Stomp, and those charges can either heal teammates or Elder Titan himself, or add more damage to a gank.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots are very useful if Elder Titan is being built to cast instead of brawl. It increases the size of his mana pool and allows him to replenish his and his teammates' mana, greatly increasing his utility and allowing him to always have the mana to cast his spells in fights.<br/><br/>Force Staff serves many useful benefits on Elder Titan if he is being built in a support-utility role. The item's components are easy to build, and it increases the size of his mana pool while also giving him some HP regen and an active that helps with his positioning, which can be crucial for getting his spells off.<br/><br/>Mekansm is built mainly as a utility item that offers stats and survivability. Elder Titan's tanky nature allows him to benefit greatly from it, however he must build up his mana pool first, as Mekansm's active costs more than any of his spells.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord gives Elder Titan stats across the board and armor, increasing his inherent tankiness and greatly boosting his intelligence to facilitate easier spell casting. However, its main utility is in its active ability, which can reduce an enemy's magic resistance further on top of Natural Order, increasing the potency of magical damage even more. Using it on top of Earth Splitter and Natural Order allows Elder Titan to cut enemies' HP by up to a maximum of 56%.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a strong item for aiding Elder Titan in casting. The base movement speed increase grants him more mobility, especially when combined with Astral Spirit's bonus movement speed, and the extra intelligence and scaling mana regen ensure that Elder Titan will always have the mana to cast what he needs. The active can pin an enemy down with a cyclone, giving Elder Titan enough time to set up a perfect Echo Stomp.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Huskar is a resilient ranged attacker who sacrifices his own health to inflict greater damage. An injured Huskar attacks with incredible speed, making him frustratingly hard to kill even at the brink of death. His deadly Life Break is supremely suited to killing enemies one-on-one, especially during the early to mid game. Huskar's natural magic resistance prevents enemies from nuking him down while he finishes the job, then heals himself with Inner Vitality. He fulfills the roles of carry and ganker, although the damage over time from Burning Spears will not match heavier carries in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very resilient.<br/><br/>Requires no mana management.<br/><br/>Can turn fights around even at low health.<br/><br/>Excellent early to mid game presence.<br/><br/>Counters heavy magical damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Many counters.<br/><br/>No disables.<br/><br/>Low armor.<br/><br/>Needs Regeneration items to Survive.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Huskar is not a true initiator. Try to let another team member initiate, then jump in to single out soft targets.<br/><br/>A good amount of Huskar's damage comes from Burning Spear's magical burn damage, meaning that magic resistance makes Huskar much less effective.<br/><br/>Huskar's abilities synergizes well with each other, Burning Spear and Life Break both use up health, and feed your Berserker's Blood increasing your damage output while Inner Vitality makes you more durable.<br/><br/>Due to his low base armor, Huskar is susceptible to physical burst damage.<br/>Good examples of this is Clinkz and Sven as well as any carry who has a Daedalus or Desolator completed.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Inner Vitality</h4>Use Inner Vitality on yourself or your allies before jumping into a fight to increase their durability.<br/><br/>Do not worry about casting it too early before a team fight as it has a fairly long duration and its cooldown at max level is a few seconds shorter than its duration. This will reduce the chances that you are caught off-guard and become disabled long enough before being able to cast it. This will also increase the chance that you can re-cast it during a fight in case that you are Purged or another team mate is in dire need of regeneration.<br/><br/>Always use Inner Vitality before using your ultimate to increase your chance of surviving and reduce the toll on your HP done by your ultimate.<br/><br/>With enough mana regeneration, you can even use Inner Vitality constantly, mitigating the need to return to base. This makes heroes such as Crystal Maiden and Keeper of the Light a good ally of Huskar.<br/><h4>Burning Spear</h4>Burning Spears is useful for harrassing enemies during the laning phase.<br/><br/>Keep in mind the cast range of Burning Spear is 450, but Huskar's attack range is only 400. Therefore you can increase your range by 50 when manually casting Burning Spear. However, putting Burning Spear on autocast will not increase your range.<br/><br/>Remember that Burning Spears will stack on an enemy. You can manual cast them repeatedly on laning phase to harass enemies without drawing creep aggro. When you can regenerate health enough to sustain Burning Spear, switch it to auto-attack and burn them down!<br/><h4>Berserker's Blood</h4>Berserker's Blood makes Huskar very potent against heavy magic damage teams.<br/><br/>With enough stacks and health left, Berserker's Blood can help you survive finishing spells that deal magical damage such as Thundergod's Wrath, Assassinate and Reaper's Scythe.<br/><br/>Berserker's Blood does not protect against pure damage. Dealing with heroes such as Bane and Timbersaw can result in death, as using your ultimate in their presence can have dire consequences, since some of their spells are not reduced by magic resistance.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that the magic resistance from Berserker's Blood DOES NOT equate to spell immunity, a common mistake for new players is to treat it as such. Huskar is still vulnerable to huge burst of magical damage when at nearly full health. Examples of this would be Requiem of Souls at point blank range (most likely after using Life Break) with the maximum amount of souls and stacks of Remote Mines both of which could kill Huskar even at full health.<br/>Berserker's Blood works best against gradual magical damage or damage spread over multiple instances like Rot, Life Drain, Mystic Flare, Static Storm, Epicenter, Echo Slam, and Poison Nova, all of which are almost impossible to be used to insta-kill Huskar since their damage will be greatly reduced. But keep in mind that some of these also provide debuffs like stun, slow and silence that could hinder Huskar.<br/><br/><br/>The attack speed from Berserker's Blood is unreliable as it depends on your current health. If you are your team's main carry, consider building attack speed items like Mjollnir and Assault Cuirass to further boost your DPS.<br/><h4>Life Break</h4>In most cases, if an enemy hero used their escape skill while Huskar is airborne, Huskar will still be able to finish his jump.<br/><br/>Be wary of heroes that have high natural magic resistance like Anti-Mage due to his Spell Shield because using Life Break against them might deal more damage to you than to them. Same can be said against heroes that usually build Hood of Defiance or Pipe of Insight.<br/><br/>You should also be warned not to use your ultimate on a hero who has spell immunity or else you lose a percentage of your health while the target does not. However, the slow will still pierce through spell immunity.<br/><br/>As Life Break deals magical damage to an enemy relative to his current health, it is possible to kill any enemy in one hit with the help of damage amplification, provided it is not spell immune or has access to very high magic resistance (e.g. Spell Shield).<br/>It is possible to use certain combinations of items and heroes together with Huskar to kill any hero instantly. For example applying the effects of Veil of Discord, Ethereal Blade and Orchid Malevolence to a target and then hitting them with an Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Life Break will cause an instant death. However, building all these utility items on Huskar himself will destroy a great deal of his carry potential. This same effect can be achieved using Soul Catcher instead of Veil of Discord or Decrepify instead of Ethereal Blade.<br/><br/><br/>Beware of heroes with Blade Mail as they can destroy you if you use Life Break on them recklessly.<br/><br/>Also it is worth noting that any hero using Blade Mail with sufficiently high health will kill you if you use Life Break on them assuming that you do not have spell immunity.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter enables Huskar to destroy enemy heroes with high health very quickly. The reduced cooldown will allow Huskar deal magical damage equal to 73.74% of the enemy's health in 4 seconds if he is able to use Life Break twice in succession.<br/>Life Break can also be used on multiple different enemies in a team fight making it easier for the rest of your team to finish them off.<br/><br/>The low cooldown from Aghanim's Scepter can also be used to jump from one hero to another. If you are being focused on by a melee carry who happen to have spell immunity, jump to another hero to kill them off, or stall enough time so that the enemy's spell immunity runs out.<br/><br/>Jumping to a different enemy is also useful for timing out debuffs on Huskar. Jumping to another enemy while you are slowed, rooted or disarmed will give you a chance to turn the tables against your enemy.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter's upgrade will also apply a 60% slow that pierces through spell immunity.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Tangoes and a Healing Salve help Huskar to regain lost health from Burning Spear.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength give extra attack damage and health to draw from when using Burning Spear. They also build into Urn of Shadows.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give a nice movement speed boost.<br/><br/>Magic Stick helps Huskar recover health in a pinch.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows helps Huskar to restore health after a gank and has a good to support allies and use it to heal himself if Inner Vitality has no mana.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian provides every stat that Huskar needs to be more effective and its Unholy Strength provides a way for Huskar to control his health. If you are able to practice armlet toggling, it will drastically improve Huskar's damage output and allow him to use it to survive fights as long as there is no Heartstopper Aura or Radiance Aura or you are not afflicted by any DPS debuff. An important fact to remember is that its active ability also adds to Inner Vitality's regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Black King Bar will cause Huskar to take no self-damage from Life Break, allowing him to use it to initiate with little risk of dying.<br/><br/>Satanic allows Huskar to sustain his health while under focus from the enemy team. It provides strength, armor and 25% lifesteal. Its active could also be used in a pinch to keep yourself from dying.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives a massive HP regen bonus from Inner Vitality, it allows Huskar to keep Unholy Strength active indefinitely and it gives enough health to allow you to be at a low enough percentage to increase stacks from your Berserker's Blood but not low enough to be bursted down. This also complements an Aghanim's Scepter pickup as it will allow you to use Life Break frequently, even against Roshan or creeps.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass gives protection from physical damage, which synergizes well with Berserker's Blood which gives magic resistance.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter increases the effectiveness of Life Break.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade makes Huskar into a much better ganker. It also gives attack speed for more Burning Spear stacks.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd gives some strength and evasion, and it is also able to disarm an attacking enemy.<br/><br/>Maelstrom or Mjollnir is a good item to pick to proc Chain Lightning as much as possible and to increase your farming potential.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade is a decent item if against low mana pool heroes such as Wraith King to prevent them from using their abilities. However, this is not recommended as it does not provide either strength or damage and is quite a hefty investment.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar is a good pickup due to its 35% chance to deal a 100 damage mini-stun and if against heroes with evasion like Phantom Assassin, Brewmaster or any carry who is planning to or already built evasion items like Heaven's Halberd or Butterfly.<br/><br/>Skull Basher and Abyssal Blade are also viable items because Huskar will proc Bash at a decent rate due to his attack speed. When Skull Basher is upgraded to Abyssal Blade, he can make use of Overwhelm after using Life Break. Keep in mind that melee carries will still proc it more even if you have the same attack speed, you do however have the range advantage.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is important to keep in mind on Huskar since you do not lose a percentage of your health when you use your ultimate while spell immune.<br/><br/>Helm of Iron Will could be bought first when planning on building a Helm of the Dominator. Due to Huskar's reliance on Burning Spears for damage and not from physical basic attacks which you rarely use against creeps in lane, an early Helm of Iron Will offers more benefits than buying an early Morbid Mask and will allow Huskar to regenerate more in the laning phase. You can even buy 2 Helms if you plan to build an Armlet of Mordiggian too, a +10 in armor and the bonus 6 HP regeneration will reduce damage in the laning phase significantly and will allow you to spam Burning Spear.<br/><br/>Platemail will drastically improve Huskar's survivability and can be used to build an Assault Cuirass or a Shiva's Guard or both if you plan to stack armor. Since Huskar is already durable against magic damage, Stacking armor will help reduce his second biggest weakness which is physical damage. However, against a pure damage heavy lineup, stacking strength or HP items is still the better solution.<br/><br/>Sange as well as its upgrades Sange and Yasha and Heaven's Halberd provide a good amount of strength to cost ratio and give a fair amount of utility.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Io is a unique hero that provides boosts to its allies by linking to them. While relatively powerless alone, Io can be extremely useful when paired with the appropriate heroes. It regenerates allies through Tether, and buffs their defense and attack speed with Overcharge. But most importantly, Io can Relocate an ally to any point on the map, setting up perfect ganks or saving that ally from certain death.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not item dependent.<br/><br/>Global mobility.<br/><br/>Grealty increases one's durability.<br/><br/>Low mana costs.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dies very easily.<br/><br/>Requires precise coordination with teammates.<br/><br/>Useless alone.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Io is best played with a partner with whom you share communication.<br/><br/>Io is extremely weak and can't do much alone. His utility comes entirely from boosting teammates.<br/><br/>Io is expected to sacrifice its life to save another teammate.<br/><br/>As a general rule, Io works best with a Carry who has mobility and health and/or mana regen issues; see the Counter page for some suggested Io Buddies.<br/><br/>Tether heals his allies for 1.5x the healing done to Io itself. Don't forget this to save allies and in lane phase, when using items like Tango, Enchanted Mango and building items like Urn of Shadows and others.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Tether</h4>Tether is required to buff any ally with Overcharge or to use Relocate.<br/><br/>Tether can be used on allied heroes to get to their side with great speed, as it latches from a considerable distance.<br/><br/>Approaching a confrontation from behind will allow for easier use of Tether's slow. Positional items are also useful for this.<br/><br/>Use Tether on an ally or lane creep to escape dangerous situations.<br/><br/>When ganking, remember to slow the target target by passing over them with Tether's link.<br/><br/>Tether to an ally, then use a healing item to double the benefit for that ally.<br/>The Tethered ally will not gain anything if Io is at full health. Using Overcharge to lower your health before using any healing items will assure you are able to pass along the boosted regeneration.<br/><br/>However, for mana, it does not matter if Io is full or not. Mana will always be transfered, regardless of Io's mana status.<br/><br/><br/>When ganking or escaping, always remember that Tether duration is the same as its cooldown, so it can be maintained on constantly as long as you have enough mana.<br/><h4>Spirits</h4>During the early game, Spirits can be used to harass and keep enemies away from the creep wave.<br/><br/>Spirits take practice and focus to control, but should not come before performing Io's other duties.<br/><br/>Spirits will hit invisible enemies, and can be used to finish off fleeing targets.<br/>It can also be used to detect invisible enemies nearby, although there is no guarantee Spirit will impact an unseen foe.<br/><br/><h4>Overcharge</h4>Overcharge is extremely powerful on carries and should be used during teamfights and ganks.<br/>Enemies may target Io because of this. Combined with its health costs, using Overcharge can leave Io very vulnerable.<br/><br/><br/>The damage reduction of this skill is also notable and can considerably increase the survivability of your partner.<br/><br/>Overcharge should always be skilled early as Io is not able to heal his allies with tether with full health. Overcharge grants an easy means to lower your HP and mana.<br/><h4>Relocate</h4>Use Relocate to bring an ally into a ganking position.<br/><br/>Use Relocate to save an ally from certain death. This is arguably the most important thing Io can do for the team.<br/>Doing so will usually result in Io's death when Relocate returns it to the original location.<br/><br/>Remember to break the Tether before this happens, or the ally will be brought back with Io.<br/><br/><br/>It's also possible to Relocate from a safe spot, then bring back an injured ally upon returning. This is not always viable however, as it entails the 12 second discrepancy between Relocations.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Gauntlets of Strength give Io a bit of extra health and damage. They can be used to build into an Urn of Shadows.<br/><br/>Tangoes, Healing Salves, and Clarity potions can be used to sustain Io and a lane partner, thanks to Tether.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give a nice movement speed boost.<br/><br/>Magic Stick restores mana and health in a pinch to both Io and a Tethered ally.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows can be used in conjunction with Tether to restore a large amount of health to Io and an ally.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a cheap upgrade from Magic Stick. It helps Io heal allies even more.<br/><br/>Mekansm heals Io's partner for 625 health, as opposed to the standard 250.<br/><br/>Bottle is useful for restoring both ally's health and mana.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots can be used to restore a large amount of mana to Io and his allies, thanks to Tether.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots can also be considered for healing allies.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Glimmer Cape is useful to evade enemies when they are focusing on Io, or to save an ally from a gank.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity serves a similar purpose and can also be used offensively as a disable to stop channeling spells or prevent escape.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque makes Io a very effective healer, thanks to its powerful health regeneration.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard provides a useful aura that can help in ganks and the slow can allow less mobile allied heroes to get closer to their targets.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides a valuable disable, and also some useful attribute bonuses.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd gives some strength and evasion, and the ability to disarm an enemy hero that is causing trouble to your team.<br/><br/>Necronomicon can be used during Relocate to aid in a gank or push.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives you cost efficient attribute bonuses and further boosts you and your Tethered partner's attack and movement speed.<br/><br/>Dagon provides extra burst damage that you might need to take down an enemy hero in a Relocate gank.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves is the next logical step for an Io with Mekansm and Arcane Boots, as it combines the two items into one slot, potentially allowing another item in your inventory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Kunkka is a strategic fighter that relies on his carefully placed abilities to disrupt enemy formations. His skills complement one another, and need to be used in conjunction to be effective. With his Tidebringer, Kunkka can deal a good amount of damage to a large area in front of him. Playing Kunkka requires good timing, tactical thinking, and an understanding of enemy movement. If insufficiently farmed, however, Kunkka will barely do any damage, and must rely on landing his abilities if he is to remain useful to his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Large, disruptive AoE abilities with massive damage.<br/><br/>Wide reach and crowd physical damage with Tidebringer.<br/><br/>X Marks the Spot is a unique single target control ability.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>A hated target in teamfights and may be focused at first.<br/><br/>Requires good timing to land ability combos.<br/><br/>Ability damage falls off in the late game.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Kunkka's abilities work best when the enemy team is clumped together. Time your ability usage accordingly.<br/><br/>In general, carry Kunkka can be placed either mid or in the safe lane.<br/>As a mid, Kunkka should focus on getting early levels and harassing down the enemy's mid with Tidebringer, then using his spells to get early kills and farm his core items.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Torrent</h4>Torrent allows Kunkka to target an area where, after a delay, any enemies in the area will be stunned, and then damaged and slowed.<br/><br/>Due to its delay, Torrent can be very hard to land and is very mana-costly on a hero with a small mana pool. Good prediction or a leading stun is required to land it properly.<br/><br/>Torrent has a very long range for an area stun, and can be used to predict and pick off fleeing enemies.<br/><br/>Kunkka makes a very visible hand gesture when casting Torrent, which opponents can easily see and use to gauge the timing in which Torrent was cast so that they can dodge it. When casting Torrent on an enemy without a leading disable, try to either cancel your animation in order to fool the enemy if they can see you, or cast it from the fog of war by taking advantage of its extremely long cast range.<br/><br/>Unlike most other spells in the game, Torrent does not require Kunkka to face in the direction that he casts the spell, preventing enemies from easily predicting the location in which the waterspout will appear. This also allows Kunkka to get the spell off a bit faster, as he will not have to turn to face the target area first. Try to be tricky with where you cast Torrent if Kunkka is visible to the enemy, and remember not to target it outside the spell's cast range, otherwise Kunkka will have to turn and walk within range to cast, allowing the enemy to easily see what direction Torrent is being cast in.<br/><br/>Torrent can be more easily landed if X Marks the Spot is used first. By inflicting X on the enemy, and then casting Torrent on that spot, you can force the enemy to return right before Torrent completes. However, mind the cast range of X Marks the Spot, as it is very low at early levels, and be sure that your timing is perfect otherwise the enemy may arrive after the torrent or have time to evade it after returning.<br/><br/>Combined with Tidebringer, Torrent can be used to lock down a foe long enough for you to maneuver into a position favourable to hit them or their teammates with cleave damage.<br/><br/>Torrent can also be used to stack a neutral camp, if timed properly. This is because the units, while thrown into the air, are technically not within the camp's spawn radius, and so new creeps will spawn. This should be utilized either to grant Kunkka's teammates a higher gold per minute, or to increase his own. Torrent should be cast at approximately the XX:57.5 second mark.<br/><h4>Tidebringer</h4>Tidebringer is a castable attack modifier that allows Kunkka to deal cleave damage in a wide area in front of him, giving him a damage bonus with each strike.<br/><br/>Because Tidebringer can only proc once every few seconds, it is recommended to build raw damage over attack speed. Getting a good Tidebringer cleave off can potentially kill enemy heroes in a single attack if Kunkka has enough damage.<br/><br/>Using Tidebringer frequently in-lane is a good way to harass a lane opponent safely from range, but it will also push the creep wave and can reduce Kunkka's ability to farm safely. Conversely though, it is also a good lane pusher when playing mid, as it can force the enemy mid to retreat to their tower when the runes spawn, allowing Kunkka and his team to more easily control the rune spots.<br/><br/>Remember that Tidebringer does not work against wards and buildings, and that leaving it on auto-cast can cause it to proc before it is needed. Try to manually cast Tidebringer whenever possible, so as not to waste its attack power and so that it is readily available should a cleave opportunity arise.<br/><br/>When set on auto-cast, Kunkka retains the damage bonus when attacking allied units, even though the spell does not proc. This can give Kunkka an advantage in denying creeps, however be sure to turn off auto-cast so that you do not accidentally proc the spell when attacking an enemy creep afterward.<br/><br/>Cleave ignores armor on the splashed targets, and the cleave damage is based on Kunkka's attack damage rather than any damage dealt to the unit that was attacked. Therefore, when using Tidebringer, it is best to attack a nearby creep to inflict cleave on all enemies behind it.<br/><br/>Remember that Tidebringer's cleave has a very long range. Angled properly, it is possible to hit enemies through the fog of war, and even through invisibility, making it a powerful ability for killing fleeing enemy heroes that are low on health. It is best to use a nearby enemy creep, or even one from a neutral camp, in order to splash the damage in the direction of your choosing.<br/><h4>X Marks the Spot</h4>X Marks the Spot is a flexible spell that can be cast on enemies and allies alike to return them to their point of origin after a delay.<br/><br/>X Marks the Spot counters enemy heroes with great mobility since the ability forcibly drag them back after enemy moves away and his or her abilities are on cooldown.<br/><br/>Used on enemies, X can be used to prevent escapes and lock down foes for your spells and those of your allies. Used on allies, it gives them a safe method of return if they are disabled while initiating. However, remember that Return still requires Kunkka to execute his cast animation, so the target will return to the X 0.4 seconds after Kunkka is commanded to.<br/><br/>When being chased, X Marks the Spot can be used to return the chasing enemy to an early and more distant location.<br/><br/>X's principal utility is in locking down a target so that they can be hit by Torrent and Ghostship, both of which are otherwise hard to land. The same applies to teammates with similarly hard to land spells such as Light Strike Array, Split Earth, and so on. Good timing is required to do so, however, as returning the target before the spell hits gives them time to evade, while returning them after will result in a clean miss.<br/><br/>X Marks the Spot has a very short cast range at level 1, making it hard to land on an enemy during a gank. However, it lasts for the full 4 seconds at all levels so managing to cast the spell will give your team a large amount of time to set up for the return.<br/><br/>There is no maximum limit on X's return range, so it can bring its target back to the origin even after teleporting across the map. As such, it can be used on a foe who is attempting to teleport back to their base, or on an ally to get back to base to grab items from the stash or refill a Bottle and then return. Kunkka has to cast X on himself before he starts teleporting to make use of this trick.<br/><br/>X Marks the Spot lasts twice as long on allies. This gives it very powerful utility since an ally can have up to 8 seconds to scout, initiate, tower dive, or otherwise harass the enemy and be pulled back to safety.<br/><br/>Beware, X Marks the Spot cannot pull back invulnerable allied units. This means that certain abilities are able to interrupt an allied X, so be sure that you know what the enemy's capabilities are, as you can return a teammate early before they are inflicted with invulnerability, or hold back the return until after.<br/><br/>Conversely though, allies who are spell immune will still be pulled back. Therefore, if trouble is encountered, they can apply spell immunity to themselves in order to prevent themselves from being disabled, and still have a way with which they can return.<br/><br/>One useful way to gauge the timing of X Marks the Spot is to use the triplets from the spell's sound effect. Each ascending triplet marks one second of the spell's duration, so knowing the timing of any disables waiting at the return spot can allow Kunkka to pull enemies back in a timely manner. Again, remember that the target is returned on a 0.4 second delay due to Kunkka's cast animation, so be mindful of that as well.<br/><h4>Ghostship</h4>Ghostship is a wide-area magic nuke that deals significant damage in its impact area and buffs allies that it passes through on the way.<br/><br/>Like Torrent, Ghostship can benefit from being set up with X Marks the Spot in order to lock down a foe prior to casting. Because X Marks the Spot's maximum cast range at level 4 exactly matches the impact distance of Ghostship, the two spells work extremely well together. Also remember to walk back and cast the spell if the target is marked at a closer distance.<br/><br/>Ghostship's cooldown is pretty short compared to other ultimate ability. After Kunkka kills a hero with all him abilities, his ultimate will be ready in less than a minute.<br/><br/>While its cooldown is quite short, Ghostship is very mana-costly, especially on a hero with a small mana pool like Kunkka. Additionally, its long delay means that landing the spell requires a large amount of crowd control or the element of surprise.<br/><br/>Ghostship will always appear a specific distance behind Kunkka and end a specific distance in front of Kunkka, taking a specific amount of time to do so. The distance at which the boat appears and hits can be seen by hovering over the ability and noting the radius circle. You can also just cast it from outside Kunkka's range as to make him move into range and ensure that the Ghostship will land to where you targeted it.<br/><br/>Although it is not obvious, the Rum buff is a very powerful ability that should never be discounted. Any allies with the Rum buff will take half damage from all enemy damage sources for its duration, and can never be killed by the remainder once the buff wears off. This allows allies to absorb up to twice the normal amount of damage and still survive, making it extremely powerful on tanky heroes that are already very damage-resistant.<br/>The Rum buff lasts only 10 seconds. If your team can't finish the fight in 10 seconds and the enemy teams has DoT abilities such as Doom or Poison Nova, consider retreating after or even before the Rum buff dissipates.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Clarity is very useful on Kunkka as his spells are all very mana-costly. Being able to use Torrent more than once without running completely out of mana greatly increases his ability to lock down foes and score early kills.<br/><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are basic regen requirements in all lanes but mid. Having flexible regen allows Kunkka to remain in lane without being harassed out.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength increase Kunkka's base damage and HP, giving him more resilience and last-hitting power.<br/><br/>Faerie Fire is a useful consumable to purchase as a mid Kunkka. The damage bonus gives him last-hitting power and allows him to splash more damage on his lane opponent with Tidebringer, and consuming it can give him some last-second burst HP regen that can save him during enemy gank attempts.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are important on all heroes, but can be quite important on Kunkka for getting in position to cast X Marks the Spot on foes at early levels.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is useful on all heroes. On Kunkka, it can help alleviate his mana issues by giving him some burst mana regen for casting his spells.<br/><br/>Bottle is effectively mandatory if Kunkka is to be played mid. A Bottle is extremely useful for replenishing Kunkka's small mana pool, and can be easily replenished using X and a teleport to base.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows gives Kunkka a measure of mana regen and some more HP and base damage, enhancing his power as a roamer-disabler. The item's active can be used to heal yourself or teammates, or add more damage in a gank.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots are the best boots for Kunkka, as they give him bonus damage with which he can last-hit more easily, as well as increasing the effectiveness of Tidebringer. The active also increases his mobility, allowing him to more easily get into position to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is powerful for all the same reasons as Magic Stick, 255 burst HP regen is very powerful and 255 burst mana is enough to allow Kunkka to cast any of his spells.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade is a very powerful initiating item to get on Kunkka, as it allows him to inflict an additional 175 damage to the entire enemy team when combined with Tidebringer. As well, it can be used for mobility or escape as demanded.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Kunkka stats and bonus movement speed.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is mandatory on all heroes. On Kunkka, it can be used to show up to teamfights, and in clutch situations be used after casting X Marks the Spot on yourself to temporarily relocate yourself to another part of the map.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Battle Fury increases the cleave percentage of Tidebringer, while also adding a cleave that can be used while Tidebringer is on cooldown. It also gives Kunkka good health and mana regeneration, allowing him to remain out in the field for longer without returning to base.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is useful both for increasing Kunkka's survivability and damage output, especially in situations where the enemy is trying to lock Kunkka down to prevent him from casting his spells.<br/><br/>Daedalus is an extremely powerful damage item in the hands of Kunkka, who can additionally benefit from building more than one to increase the proc chance. If his damage is high enough and he procs a crit alongside Tidebringer, Kunkka can potentially slay multiple enemy heroes with a single slash of his sword.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd provides some Strength and evasion, and allows you to disarm the enemy's carry in a teamfight. It is useful for giving Kunkka some damage alongside survivability against physical damage.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass reduces enemy armor, allowing you and your allies to deal more damage, while giving an armor and attack speed boost at the same time. While it lacks synergy with your spells and abilities, the aura it provides should never be underestimated.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque provides a lot of extra health and regeneration, and helps Kunkka recover from fights almost immediately. It's especially useful if you're always being focused in teamfights. As well, the additional base damage can help you inflict damage with Tidebringer as it can be augmented by percentage-based damage buffs from certain allies.<br/><br/>Silver Edge adds more strength to Kunkka, giving more attack damage and a potential slow to proc on an attack. The Break component of Silver Edge can make killing certain enemy heroes easier, such as Phantom Assassin or Viper.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger, combined with X Marks the Spot, greatly extends Kunkka's reach when attacking with Tidebringer, and is useful no matter what role he plays. He can X himself and then blink forward, casting any spells or attacking with Tidebringer, and then returning to safety. Used by itself, Kunkka can instantly position himself in the best location from which to cleave the enemy, or jump within range to cast X on a foe during an initiation.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel frees up an item slot for Kunkka, giving him room to build another major item if needed, and allows him to use X for temporary returns to base without using 75 gold each time. The ability to globally re-position is also very powerful, and the enhanced movement speed gives him better positioning, chasing and escaping ability.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter improves Kunkka's stats across the board and greatly improves the utility of Ghostship. Because the boat will spawn directly on Kunkka and drag any nearby enemies, it can immediately place the Rum buff on Kunkka and create distance between him and any nearby opponents. Most importantly, halving the impact delay allows Kunkka to use the spell more effectively and greatly improves the odds of landing a successful boat.<br/><br/>Aether Lens boosts Kunkka's casting power, making all of his nukes much more formidable. It improves Kunkka's mana pool while also providing HP regen to keep his health topped up. The increased casting range on all of his spells allows him to get off disables and nukes from farther away, while the spell damage amplification improves the damage they deal.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a good mid-game utility item. Its aura provides armor, HP and mana regen, bonus damage and lifesteal to Kunkka and all nearby allies, giving them a useful edge in teamfights. It is very strong when combined with Ghostship's Rum buff, as the armor and lifesteal auras' effectiveness are doubled due to the reduced damage that teammates are taking.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard can be a powerful purchase to enhance Kunkka's survivability. The armor, HP and damage block all work to give Kunkka great resistance against physical damage, allowing him to weather attacks and get his spells off in fights more easily. More importantly though, the item's active ability can be used alongside Ghostship's Rum buff to drastically increase your team's survivability during a fight, as any damage the enemy inflicts will be greatly reduced prior to being halved by Rum.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is highly situational and very risky, but extremely powerful in Kunkka's hands. Combined with Tidebringer and a Daedalus, Kunkka can deal tremendous amounts of cleave damage and potentially wipe the entire enemy team under the right circumstances.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Legion Commander is ganking carry whose damage potential is theoretically unlimited. She is able to heal, buff herself and her allies with Press the Attack, and finish off enemies with Overwhelming Odds. With each victorious Duel, the Legion Commander becomes even more unstoppable. However, if she fails to win regular Duels, her damage may suffer as a result, rendering her much less useful as the game goes on.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Excellent snowballing potential.<br/><br/>Tanky during laning phase.<br/><br/>Prevent enemy from escaping.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on winning Duels.<br/><br/>High mana cost during laning phase.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Even though Legion Commander is technically a carry, she needs to also gank early to increase her bonus damage from Duel.<br/>Be sure to take advantage of any ganking opportunities, instead of farming endlessly away from your team.<br/><br/><br/>Legion Commander works best in coordinated teams that can effectively soften and disable a target for her to kill with Duel, and thus snowball as a carry.<br/><br/>During early to mid-game, try targeting the softer casters or supports, like Crystal Maiden and Shadow Shaman. This way, if you were to lose a Duel and they gain the bonus attack damage, it won't affect your team in the late-game as these heroes rely more on their spells than their attacks.<br/><br/>Duel allows her to build a large amount of attack damage, meaning that to amplify her damage, it's most cost-effective to build items that reduce the enemy's armor or increases her attack speed, rather than buying items which add more damage.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Overwhelming Odds</h4>This is your ranged damage spell. It can be used to harass enemies in lane and get last hits at the same time.<br/><br/>It's most effective against multiple enemy heroes, It's best to save this spell to cast when you can hit all the enemy heroes in your lane.<br/><br/>Using this in the jungle is often a waste of mana due to most camps only having 2-3 creeps, and stacks often having multiple magical resistance auras.<br/><br/>It can be used to stack a camp at a distance in order to return to lane faster, or to stack two camps at once.<br/><h4>Press the Attack</h4>Use Press the Attack before joining a fight or initiating a Duel to give Legion Commander bonus attack speed.<br/><br/>Remember that this spell heals and dispels debuffs. Use it on allies if they are low on health, or need a stun or other debuff dispelled.<br/><br/>If your carry has more damage per attack than you, use it on them during a push.<br/><br/>Press the attack has a very long cast backswing (0.93 seconds), and should be cancelled whenever possible to take advantage of the attack speed as soon as possible.<br/><h4>Moment of Courage</h4>The lifesteal and extra damage allows Legion Commander to jungle as early as level one.<br/><br/>The benefit of leveling this skill is minimal in the early game. A second point is enough to jungle sustainably, after that it's usually better to max her other skills first.<br/><br/>Take advantage of enemy creeps by dueling near the creep wave. They will attack you and thus proc Moment of Courage more often.<br/><br/>The instant attacks from this passive act like a situationally active attack speed boost which can put her effective attack speed above the normal 600 attack speed limit.<br/><h4>Duel</h4>Even if an ally deals the killing blow during a duel, the attack damage is still applied to the surviving Duellist.<br/><br/>In the early game, Duel easier targets like supports to make sure Legion Commander gets the bonus damage.<br/><br/>When Dueling enemies with more HP, make sure Legion Commander has the damage and/or assistance to. Otherwise, you will feed bonus damage to the enemy carry.<br/><br/>Generally, DO NOT Duel enemy carries unless they're very low on health already.<br/><br/>Due to the double edged nature of Duel, attempting to use it liberally on targets in teamfights can sometimes give bad results for you and your team.<br/><br/>Initiating with it is not always the best choice as duels should ideally not last long in order to avoid being stunned and denied of your success.<br/><br/>Duel Silences and Mutes both participants, so you should use PTA, blademail, and other active items before<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items</b><br/>Stout Shield is generally a good idea if offlaning or jungling, as the decreased damage from attacks will help her stay alive, and help withstand harass from enemies in the offlane.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Healing Salve is useful for a big burst of early lane regen, or a cheaper alternative to Stout Shield for a jungling start.<br/><br/>Clarity potions help Legion Commander cast OO more often in the early game, ensuring more CS.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade is necessary if you wish to jungle between waves when laning, and it helps get last hits.<br/><br/>Iron Talon is often picked up for jungling.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game</b><br/>Ring of Basilius can be important for the armor and mana regen, as well as the little extra early attack damage it gives. As an option, it can be extended into a Vladmir's Offering if there are no other Vladmir's carriers in your team.<br/><br/>Magic Stick will help with Legion's early mana problems in lane, but is unnecessary in the jungle. It can always be upgraded into a Magic Wand if necessary.<br/><br/>Power Treads are essential on Legion Commander, because of the health and attack speed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items</b><br/>Shadow Blade can be a good initiation tool for Legion Commander if there are no enemy sentries around; it adds some DPS to her attacks as oppossed to Blink Dagger which only provides the Blink ability. If you're fast enough you can Backstab your intended Duel target before Dueling right away to improve your chances of winning Duels, specially early on. It can also be upgraded to Silver Edge, which increases her stats and works very much the same for initiating Duel, but its Break can disable powerful passive abilities, such as Spectre's Dispersion and Desolate, Troll Warlord's Bash and Fervor or Phantom Assassin's Blur and Coup de Grace abilities (do note that Silver Edge's Break does not disable passives provided by items).<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is an excellent option on Legion Commander because it gives health, attack damage and attack speed; quite literally every stat Tresdin could want. The health loss is also greatly mitigated by the lifesteal from Moment of Courage. If you already have Blink Dagger as well, this is a good choice for a damage item in order to start collecting damage from won Duels - simply activate Armlet before Blinking in and Dueling.<br/><br/>Blade Mail can help deal more damage during Duels when the Duel target can easily out-damage Legion Commander, such as Huskar, Sven or Ursa. It's also great against ranged enemy carries in particular, since they may be able to attack and kite Legion Commander before she even approaches melee range to start counterattacking, but they tend to be very fragile, such as Drow Ranger, Windranger or Sniper.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational</b><br/>Blink Dagger will allow Legion Commander to mobility in battle filed more effective,letting her became much aggressive in the early game.<br/><br/>Desolator is a good item to consider as the armor reduction will help kill enemies in Duel faster, and is all-around helpful for your other allied carries.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is an all-round useful tool to avoid disables. Remember to activate it before using Duel.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is an excellent item to consider if you want attack speed and damage. Remember to activate the active before you Legion Commander for extra damage when they attack you.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is always beneficial as it gives your team armor, takes away the enemy team's armor, and gives very good attack speed that can be used to win Duels later in the game.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade increases her survivability giving bonus HP, HP regeneration and blocking 70 damage from incoming attacks. The bash chance is very powerful on her, since it can proc on the hits guaranteed by Moment of Courage. Avoid getting this early on, as it is very expensive and you should be focusing on getting more attack speed, and using the attack damage from already won Duels to win even more Duels.<br/><br/>Satanic is a good option if you really need more lifesteal and strength. However, most of the time Moment of Courage will give you enough survivability.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar is always good against enemies who have any form of evasion.<br/><br/>Daedalus can be a great damage item for Legion Commander if there is no particular need for True Strike or the disable effects provided by Skull Basher or Abyssal Blade. It is particularly good for Legion Commander, as the damage bonus from won Duels is multiplied by the Daedalus' critical strike, meaning that her attack damage increases multiplicatively with each Duel you win. Given enough Duels won, it's possible for her to out-damage much stronger physical damage carries such as Sven or Phantom Assassin, even if the latter may have an equally good item build.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd increases your survivability by giving you strength and evasion. Use the active ability to the target you want to Duel to let you have more chance to win the Duel.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a good rushed item situationally. It gives you excellent stats and makes you very tanky for the uninterruptible Duel that it also gives. The stats, combined with Moment of Courage allows you to almost always win any Duel against most Heroes in the early and midgame.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lifestealer is a voracious flesh-eater who Feasts on his prey to regain his health, after inflicting them with deadly Open Wounds. Consumed by madness, he will go through vicious Rages that will grant him magic immunity and bonus attack speed. If he's especially hungry and desperate, he can Infest any creep and hide inside like a parasite, devouring him when he's finally released.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Built-in magic immunity (and some attack speed too).<br/><br/>A great anti-tank.<br/><br/>Pairs nicely with any mobile initiator.<br/><br/>Infest can be great to use in the middle of a fight to heal you back up....<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>His only disable is a slow (granted, a decent one).<br/><br/>His ultimate can be a little underwhelming, especially in the late game.<br/><br/>Almost no AOE.<br/><br/>.... IF (and only if) there's a nearby creep with lots of hp remaining.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>There is a term called the N'aix bomb among players which includes a N'aix player infesting a high mobility hero such as Storm Spirit, Puck, Queen of Pain, Magnus, Spirit Breaker and invisible heroes like, Riki and Nyx Assassin to initiate upon enemies by having these heroes enter the fray and unleashing all of their own spells in quick succession before N'aix himself comes out of them and dealing the nuke damage of Infest while following it up with his DPS using Rage.<br/><br/>It is possible to solo Roshan if you are a higher leveled Lifestealer, although it takes a very long time. To do this, you keep attacking Roshan until you reach low health, then go to the nearby Radiant Jungle, and use your abilities to heal, then go back to Roshan and repeat the process. If you plan on doing this, be careful of enemy wards anywhere nearby, as if you get ganked by the enemy team you have a low chance of surviving.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Rage</h4>Rage increases his attack speed, thus chance based items like Mjollnir or Skull Basher become safer choices, as higher attack speed it allows the items to proc more often and reliably.<br/><br/>Rage has an instant cast time, maybe try to dodge an incoming Storm Hammer or Magic Missile, wasting your opponent's mana and indirectly protecting your allies.<br/><h4>Feast</h4>Feast deals bonus damage based on your target's current HP. The lower he is, the less Feast will help you.<br/>This gives a weird synergy between Lifestealer and Viper, as the Netherdrake deals bonus damage to low HP heroes with Nethertoxin. So in an ideal scenario, you could hit a full-HP hero first a couple of times, then let Viper finish him off while you switch target... But things usually don't go this smoothly...<br/><br/><h4>Open Wounds</h4>Open Wounds Heal for a percentage of the damage they deal to that unit. Using Iron Talon on a Creep will also heal you.<br/><br/>Since Open Wounds' cast range is so bad at level 1 (a measly 200, barley more than your auto attack), it scales proportionately pretty well!... But neither the slow or the heal or the duration improves.<br/><h4>Infest</h4>Infest can control Ancient Creeps at level 2.<br/><br/>Controlling a creep while Infested won't break the creep's cover.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items</b><br/>Consumables like Tango and Healing Salve are good for covering your health issues until you can sustain yourself with lifesteal.<br/><br/>Stout Shield Stout Shield helps deal with harassment in lane, or block damage in jungle. Later can be upgraded to Vanguard and a future Abyssal Blade.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade makes last hitting easier.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items</b><br/>Boots of Speed are needed to gank in combination with Open Wounds.<br/><br/>Magic Stick sustains Lifestealer if the enemy has a certain number of spammable skills.<br/><br/>Blight Stone increases Lifestealer's early game damage, and builds into Desolator later.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a nice early game pickup if his lane has a moderate level of kill potential, as the slow helps Lifestealer to catch up with the enemy.<br/><br/>Hand of Midas allows Lifestealer to comeback with a bad laning phase or keep the gold advantage of jungling. Note that the item would delay your mid-game power spike as better items could be purchased with the gold spent.<br/><br/><br/><b>Mid-game items</b><br/>Phase Boots allows the Lifestealer to close distance on his targets early on in order to get within Open Wounds' short range. Since Lifestealer could only deal damage from a close distance, Phase Boots is his best choice.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is Lifestealer's core item as it greatly mitigates Lifestealer's lack of armor and attack speed. The armlet shines with the extra HP, armor and damage from the active Unholy Strength, all of which Lifestealer desperately needs. Feast, Open Wounds negates the health loss to some extent, while the rest two abilities offer chance of armlet toggling.<br/><br/><br/><b>Late-game items</b><br/>Desolator increases Lifestealer's damage output greatly as it reduces armor of the enemy, allows him to tear down supports and carries with the help of extra attack speed and Spell Immunity of Rage. The item helps with farming and pushing towers as well.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass compensates for N'aix's low base armor, and gives more attack speed for use with Feast. The armor reduction allows for a faster tower pushing and farming presence.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items</b><br/>Drum of Endurance offers extra movement speed and attack speed with the active Endurance. The attributes also boost Lifestealer's mana regeneration and Strength. The item could be bought if a lot of teamfight is happening in early game.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator offers a few stats together with attack speed and HP regeneration aura. The active Dominate could give the team a certain level of variability. The item is suited if the team is heading for early-game push.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha gives Lifestealer movement speed, attack speed, damage and a chance to maim a target. It is viable if movement speed is crucial in this game to catch up with the enemies.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade gives Lifestealer a reliable source of stun, allows him to disable his prey long enough for him to tear down. Again Lifestealer has almost no damage output outside of melee range, so it is really crucial to 'hit a target' as a melee carry.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar solves problem of evasion. The mini stuns also helps interrupting channeling spells.<br/><br/>Daedalus lets Lifestealer crit his feast damage. Against high health heroes, such as Pudge and Sven, Lifestealer can deal huge crits to his enemies and heal himself for immense amounts of health.<br/><br/>Bloodthorn is generally an alternative of Daedalus and Monkey King Bar as it provides extra attacks speed, mana pool and mana regen. The active Soul Rend allows him to rip your opponents apart with a bit of control.<br/><br/>Mjollnir could be useful if illusion happens to be a problem, as both Static Charge and Chain Lightning helps with dealing illusions. As a frontliner, Static Charge could be triggered towards its maximum effect. Meanwhile, the item helps with farming and wave-clearing.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is a highly situational pick under the circumstaces that it is extremely hard for Lifestealer to output damage without the help of Spell Immunity. Possible examples include Riki with Smoke Screen and Anti Mage with Mana Break.<br/><br/>Manta Style helps Lifestealer purge debuffs, mostly silences, to activate Rage. It also provides movement speed and attack speed as well as decent stats.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd provide evasion against physical-attacks based enemies, as well as disabling an enemy carry from their primary source of damage for a while.<br/><br/>Moon Shard serves as an extra source of attack speed with enough gold in late game, or a quick add-up of attack speed in mid game with having an advantage over the other team.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger gives N'aix a chance to close the gap between vulnerable heroes who like to keep their distance from fights, escape after using Infest. This is useful if you find yourself unable to get in range for what would otherwise be free kills. Keep in mind that with the help of allies, Infest could do the same job as well.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade provides decent attack damage and attack speed boost, and an unreliable initiate & escape method. It gives Lifestealer solo pick-off potential if the game goes towards the direction of split pushing and requires a gank method.<br/><br/>Solar Crest serves as a cheap alternative of Desolator with extra evasion and armor. The active could be used to reduce enemies' armor even further.<br/><br/>Radiance gives Lifestealer both physical damage and magical damage through Burn and accelerates his farm speed. The ancients (or siege) serves as a nice vehicle with Infest.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives Lifestealer immense durability and some damage, permitting permanent activation of Armlet of Mordiggian. It is a good item pickup if Lifestealer could be completely invincible after the purchase of Heart of Tarrasque.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives Lifestealer a new ability Infest, which serves as a niche pick with extra initiation and saving potential, as it renders the ally invulnerability through the assimilate period.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lycan is a remarkable pusher and split-pusher that can wear down the enemies and force them to react quickly to his regular tower onslaughts; as towers melt incredibly fast under his and his minions' pressure, boosted by their canine Feral Impulse. His only contribution to full-on team fights will be the bonus damage he grants with Howl to his allies, his allies' summons, his owns summons and himself... And his formidable right-click power. Else he can surge out of the woods for a quick gank or push after he transformed with Shapeshift, moving at a speed of 650. Finally, good players will make the best usage of his Summon Wolves ability and scout the enemies' position while remaining undetected since they're invisible when maxed out.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great jungler.<br/><br/>Can take out Roshan by himself.<br/><br/>Terrific pusher.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can require some help in the laning stage.<br/><br/>Reliant on BKB for protection.<br/><br/>No reliable disables.<br/><br/>Little team fight contribution.<br/><br/>Needs correct micro-management and decision-making to get the most out of him.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because your Howl immobilize Lycan use it just before Shapeshift.<br/><br/>When taking on Roshan, it is advised to use a Smoke of Deceit to avoid being spotted by enemy observer wards. Teams facing a Lycan will do their best to prevent early Roshan kills by planting observer wards near the pit; given that a detected Lycan is easy prey while doing battle with Roshan, slipping past those wards will do wonders for his lifespan.<br/><br/>At level 7, with items like Vladmir's Offering and Power Treads or Medallion of Courage, Lycan can solo Roshan. Summon your Wolves and tank them alternately with the hero, but do not let them die until the re-summon is ready. Keep Shapeshift just in case the enemy comes for you, so you can escape.<br/><br/>Any item that provides armor reduction (Desolator, Medallion, Assault Cuirass) or an aura benefits both the wolves and the Necronomicon units. Keep in mind that the melee Necronomicon Warrior has the lowest Base Attack Time of the game of 0.75 seconds, which makes him scale really well with Howl's flat damage bonus. Adding reduced armor to the mix will considerably increase your total DPS.<br/><br/>You can buy a Scythe of Vyse to disable and slow your enemy from distance to hunt him.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Summon Wolves</h4>Wolves can be used to scout runes at the beginning of the match and during the laning phase to avoid losing gold and experience.<br/><br/>Always Summon Wolves in the base when going out to jungle for the first time (at about the 0-10 second mark) since the wolves are fast enough that you can get a creep camp killed without using any mana.<br/><br/>Wolves' invisibility at level 3, very low base attack time and quick movement make them great deniers. Use them to destroy runes, aegis and allied towers with all impunity if the situation is too risky, or too far away for you to go there in person. The most talented players will even manage to entirely body-block a hero in a narrow path with both wolves, and possibly deny yourself if certain debuffs are placed on Lycan.<br/><br/>Wolves can also be used to scout and keep tabs on particular heroes without them knowing. Select your wolf and hit M (default) and then click an enemy hero; the wolf will follow the hero but will not attack, so it will remain invisible. Do this with each wolf and you can get constant vision of two enemy heroes. This is great for setting up ganks or for evaluating whether to take a team fight in a particular area. Keep in mind that if your wolves lose vision of who they are following for too long, they stop following.<br/><br/>You can also use the wolves' invisibility to sneak past the enemy lines and teleport to them using Boots of Travel, hitting one tier 3 while allied creeps disabled Backdoor Protection on another.<br/>With a Necronomicon 3 and another big item such as Assault Cuirass, you probably have enough DPS to even go through backdoor protection, as a last resort while the enemy is somehow distracted.<br/><br/><br/>Use your wolves to stack two ancient camps at once. Then you can summon your necronomicon to take them down quickly.<br/><h4>Howl</h4>Always keep an eye on the minimap. Save Howl to give teammates a decent damage boost, aiding them in fighting and securing kills.<br/><br/>If the enemy somehow denies plenty of their creeps, the +14 damage from a level 1 one Howl will go a long way to help you securing them.<br/><h4>Feral Impulse</h4>As the description says, the aura is applied to every unit under Lycan's control. This includes his wolves obviously, his Necronomicon units and any unit he might have under control through purchase of one or more Helm of the Dominator(s)<br/><br/>You can control even more units with Ability Draft shenanigans.<br/><h4>Shapeshift</h4>Shapeshift is a very strong and versatile Ultimate to use. When activated, it gives Lycan hasted movement speed, allowing a great deal of maneuverability in battle to chase down fleeing heroes or to escape from potentially dangerous areas. While Shapeshifted, you are immune to every kind of Slow, including hexes, purges and powerful slowing ultimates like Epicenter, Freezing Field.<br/><br/>Up to a certain extent, once you start relying on your fast movement speed, you are more vulnerable to root effects like Pit of Malice or Frostbite, especially since Lycan seldom builds a Manta Style.<br/><br/>Shapeshift is an aura and the 650 movement speed is shared with units under his control allowing the wolves and Necronomicon units to chase as well. Unlike Feral Impulse, the aura is global; if you're desperate to get a bit of damage on a building (to finish it off?) you can always use Shapeshift and only send your summons in.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Quelling Blade helps Lycan farm, especially if he starts in the jungle.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection gives some early durability upgrades into Ring of Basilius.<br/><br/>Tangos are always good to have, as is an Iron Branch or two since you'll need one anyway for your Vlad's.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Power Treads gives you movement speed, attack speed, and some extra damage and durability while set on strength.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives extra armor to your wolves, extra mana regeneration for yourself, and later builds into Vladmir's Offering.<br/><br/>Blight Stone is the cheapest item that will improve your wolves' damage output by reducing your targets' armor. It can be upgraded into a Medallion of Courage or a Desolator.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Vladmir's Offering gives lifesteal, damage, and armor in an aura, so his wolves get more powerful as well. The mana regeneration also helps with his small mana pool.<br/><br/>Necronomicon 3 is the default option on Lycan. The extra strength and intelligence is always nice too.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is useful on many melee heroes. Lycan is no exception as more strength and temporary magic immunity let him get to his target and deal more damage when he gets there.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Soul Ring is an alternative source of mana in the early game, which can be useful considering Summon Wolves's high mana cost of 145.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is usually the better choice over Soul Ring, as it enables you to take out Roshan by your lonesome self. It can also be upgraded into a Solar Crest. It can be difficult to properly micro-manage your minions while using your items' abilities so you can also skip it if you don't feel like doing too many things at once.<br/><br/>Skull Basher is a reliable-ish way to add a disable to your arsenal and stop someone. It can be upgraded later to an Abyssal Blade through purchase of a Vanguard, which has some benefit to Lycan on it's own.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd gives Lycan's attacks a chance to lesser maim; slowing opponents attack and move speed helping him chase them down, with additional evasion.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque greatly increases health and health regeneration allowing Lycan to tank more effectively. The damage gained from it is also entirely from strength, which is amplified by both Feral Impulse and Vladmir's Offering. Lycan can also run out of a fight with Shapeshift at very low HP and come right back into it after a short rest.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel are highly recommended late game, or when the enemies tier 3 tower or barracks are vulnerable. Whenever the enemy tries to push, go to a lone lane and split push as much as you can. Lycan is arguably one of the best heroes at taking down towers fast, due to this enemies will have to send someone back to deal with you. However, if a teamfight starts anyways, you can teleport back to help your allies instead.<br/><br/>Desolator improves Lycan's tower pushing and increases his damage. It also synergizes with an Assault Cuirass pickup and creates a huge armor disparity.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass gives armor, attack speed to Lycan and his allies (including his minions), and reduces the opponents' armor (including their towers').<br/><br/>Moon Shard is an interesting choice on Lycan. Many players love to split-push and avoid fights while playing Lycan. Few items will help you take down towers faster than a Moon Shard, but it gives no other benefit except a bit of extra night vision (but you don't need any other benefits if you're avoiding fights and only hitting buildings).<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar gives you a good chance to cancel the enemies channeled abilities including Town Portal Scrolls. It can be necessary when facing tons of evasion or blind effects such as Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light or Phantom Assassin's Blur. It's one of the few scenarios where you may opt to skip entirely Necronomicon.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade gives good an extra tool for initiation or escape, and is a favourite for ganking players. The bonus damage coming out of stealth is always helpful. It can be further upgraded into a Silver Edge.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Magnus is one of the few melee heroes who can solo the middle lane well, because of his skill set. Shockwave allows him to safely get last hits while also harassing the lane opponent. His ultimate, Reverse Polarity, is an extremely important ability for teamfights, allowing him to stun and group up enemies hit into a small area in front of him, which can then be moved through Skewer. It is ideal for him especially if he is needed to be a carry in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great teamfighter thanks to Reverse Polarity and Skewer.<br/><br/>Can be played as right-clicker.<br/><br/>Compliments the team's late-game carry.<br/><br/>Good hero to pick off with.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Only useful in the late-game because of Reverse Polarity.<br/><br/>Has mana problems because of high-mana cost spells and spamming Shockwave.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Most of Magnus' abilities work effectively only if his targets are in front of him. When surrounded, Magnus will be forced to change directions too much, not only delaying him from casting spells in rapid succession, but also rendering his spells' area-of-effects useless. As such, place Magnus in the side lines, or until his enemies are in a manageable range in front of him. You should only place yourself in the middle when planning to cast your ultimate, Reverse Polarity, since it forces all of the targets you hit to be in front of you.<br/><br/>Magnus players need to communicate with the team because his initiations are most likely to be sudden.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shockwave</h4>Shockwave is Magnus's ranged nuke, one with a low mana cost:<br/><br/>Shockwave is Magnus's signature laning ability, since it's perfect for both harassing heroes and last-hitting creeps. Thanks to the mana cost and low cooldown, Magnus is able to perform this ability continuously, so long as he receives a stable mana supply.<br/><br/>Though usually used against disabled enemies, Shockwave can act as a great finisher to fleeing enemies. Make sure to cast it carefully, since it has a limited range.<br/><br/>Take note of Shockwave's limited area-of-effect. Much like Lion's Earth Spike, Shockwave directly affects targets in a straight path. Aim to hit multiple targets to maximize its effectiveness.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Empower</h4>Empower is a great buff that boosts base damage for a long duration, as well as grant cleave with each attack on melee heroes. Use it as much as you can on allies or yourself whenever possible, especially when a team fight is ensuing. Outside of team fights, Empower could be used for farming in lanes or jungles.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to cast Empower on ranged allies, especially if they are carries; ranged heroes like Drow Ranger or Weaver can greatly benefit from the base damage boost, since it adds more power to their already devastating basic attacks.<br/><br/>In comparison, a Battle Fury has a cleave radius of 280, and does 35% damage. Empower has a smaller radius of 200, but deals 50% damage at its highest level. This ability can, in some cases, act as a free Battle Fury.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Skewer</h4>Skewer| is soft-nuke and reposition skill that Magnus to rush forth towards a certain place and forcefully drag, and damage, all enemy units in his path. It is a tricky ability to use effectively:<br/><br/>When the target is moving, determine its path ahead of time, since there is a short delay in deploying. The closer you are to the target, the sooner Skewer will land.<br/><br/>To maximize its range, always target Skewer's landing point from a distance.<br/><br/>Note that Skewer is not a disable; it does not interrupt targets from casting their spells. Skewer is more of a crippling ability used to push targets to a certain distance and slow them, making escape more difficult.<br/><br/>Always try to Skewer in front of an enemy; the farther the target is pushed away from safety, the better.<br/><br/>Though it is offensive in nature, Skewer can also act as a quick escape mechanism, functioning similarly to a slower Force Staff. You can charge toward cliffs to make it more difficult for your pursuers to chase you.<br/><br/>During the laning phase, try to Skewer enemy heroes toward your tower; they will be forced to take tower damage, giving you additional offense while fighting them.<br/><br/>Skewer placement is usually ideal when in front of a hero. This can easily be attained with a Blink Dagger, as it lets you blink in front of your enemy for an easier placement. Invisibility can also be used to your advantage, as you can easily place yourself in front of the target without their knowledge (unless of course they have methods to prevent invisibility).<br/><br/>Skewer is a good initiation ability in the absence of a Blink Dagger. Use it to position yourself into the middle of an enemy team for Reverse Polarity. Keep in mind that you are not immune to crowd control during Skewer, so wait for the proper time before attempting to use Skewer in this fashion.<br/><br/>Skewer has a long cooldown of 30 seconds, so make sure to use it only when you really need it; otherwise, you will lose either an escape ability, or an offensive cripple.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Reverse Polarity</h4>Reverse Polarity is one of the most powerful team fight disables in the game:<br/><br/>When planning to cast, place yourself in the middle of as many heroes as you can. The more heroes you disable, the more advantage you gain in the team fight.<br/>But don't be too greedy to use your ultimate, Reverse Polarity on many heroes. Even though it's much better to use Magnus' ultimate on many heroes, it's still good to use Reverse Polarity on the core heroes of the enemy team.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Bracer provides additional Strength and damage.<br/><br/>Bottle can save Magnus trips to the fountain, since its mana rejuvenation works well with his low-mana cost abilities. It is crucial if soloing the middle lane, allowing for rune control.<br/><br/>Magic Wand will not only provide him bonus attributes, but also more regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Power Treads give slight attribute buffs for damage/attack speed/mana regen depending on what you set them on (strength/agility/intelligence respectively). Recommended to get set on Strength.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger will help Magnus initiate with Reverse Polarity, as well as give him more mobility. Shockwave and Skewer can also be efficiently used after blinking in front of the enemy.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives him additional strength and intelligence for his health and mana pool, as well as give him a small boost to his attack and movement speed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Battle Fury gives Magnus more regeneration, additional attack damage, and a permanent cleave that stacks with Empower.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb gives Magnus more regeneration and the ability to cast his ultimate in a shorter period of time.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque helps him tank more damage, as well as give him additional attack damage.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness will give him a quick boost in attack speed, which could help when he is buffed with Empower.<br/><br/>Daedalus gives Magnus critical strike, enabling him to deal huge damage without relying on his spells.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass gives Magnus additional attack speed as well as armor, and also debuff his enemies' armor.<br/><br/>Black King Bar makes it easier for Magnus to use his ultimate, as he can place himself in the middle of heroes without being interrupted. It can also be used so that he can live longer against too many disablers.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Magnus an additional nuke once he's in the middle of the enemy team, much needed armor, and a large boost to his somewhat small mana pool.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Night Stalker is a strong early game ganker during the night. Night Stalker depends greatly on darkness in order to be effective as his abilities greatly increase in strength during the night. If left unchecked, Night Stalker can snowball by getting kills after kills in the early game and controlling the map in the mid-later stages of the game with superior night vision. Night Stalker is not a strong team fighter and should be using superior vision and map control to dictate when and where team fights should occur.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Superior night vision allows Night Stalker to control the map and scout effectively to jump on an unsuspecting lone hero or retreat safely from a scouted gank.<br/><br/>Bulky<br/><br/>High night presence, allowing to shut down individual targets with a semispammable slow, miss chance and silence debuff and chase them down with superior move speed.<br/><br/>Great for hit and run gank tactics<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Weak in team fights due to the lack of strong area of effect spells and ultimate<br/><br/>Weak during day time, forced to play around night time.<br/><br/>Small mana pool.<br/><br/>Poor lane phase.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Unlike other heroes in the game, Night Stalker has below-maximum sight range in the daytime, with only 1200 compared to most other heroes' 1800. However, he more than compensates for this by possessing 1800 night vision, a value only equaled by a few other heroes in the game and more than double the rest. This means that while Night Stalker is relatively easy to sneak up on and gank in daylight, he possesses powerful situational awareness at night, which can allow him to use his abilities to the utmost.<br/><br/>Because of his reliance on levels to be effective in the early game, as well as need for items to take advantage of his passive, Night Stalker is best played as a core hero.<br/>In many situations, Night Stalker can be a very strong solo mid-laner. His excellent base damage and high base armor allow him to get last-hits and denies fairly reliably, and he benefits greatly from solo experience as he can take advantage of the levels once the first night hits. As well, being mid gives him the option of ganking either top or bottom without the need for a Town Portal Scroll, as he can reach either lane easily and quickly due to Hunter in the Night.<br/><br/>As he can be very strong with just early levels, Night Stalker can be a relatively strong off-laner. His high base strength and armor, along with respectable base damage allow him to survive relatively easily in the off-lane, and use his early levels to punish the enemy's safe-lane once the first night comes.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Void</h4>Void is a damage nuke that mini-stuns its target upon cast and greatly reduces their movement speed, preventing them from running away easily.<br/><br/>Void is the best ability to max early, as it will deal nuke damage to the target, mini-stun them, and then slow them down to allow Balanar to easy get within attack range with Hunter in the Night. Its low cooldown also means that the spell can be used twice or more in a gank or teamfight.<br/><br/>When laning, it is best to avoid leveling Void beyond level 1 even if you have skill points to spend. The ability deals 90 damage at level 1, enough to get last-hits at range, and leveling it up will increase its mana cost. Therefore, it is wise to save the skill point until the additional damage is needed in order to deal damage to enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Remember that Void will mini-stun its target, so Night Stalker can use it to cancel channeled abilities, particularly Town Portal Scroll. Against smart opponents though, it can be wise to wait to cast it until the enemy attempts to use their Town Portal Scroll, as using it to initiate a gank can give them a window to begin channeling an escape, since Night Stalker does not possess any other interrupting disables.<br/><br/>Void's low cooldown makes it a strong spell for breaking Linken's Sphere on an enemy. This can pave the way for allies to cast additional disables on the target, or for Crippling Fear from Night Stalker himself.<br/><h4>Crippling Fear</h4>Crippling Fear allows Night Stalker to inflict an enemy with a powerful silence and miss chance, which increases greatly in potency at night.<br/><br/>Crippling Fear has relatively poor scaling, as it gives Balanar a 5 second silence with one point but only increases slightly in duration with subsequent levels. It is wise to only spend one skill point in the ability early on, but leave it at level 1 until both Void and Hunter in the Night are maxed out.<br/><br/>In fights with multiple enemies, it is important to cast Crippling Fear on the right target in order to prevent the enemy from retaliating. Try to target Crippling Fear on an important enemy caster in order to remove them from the fight for at least 5 seconds, as it can prevent them from hindering your team during a fight.<br/><br/>Depending on the situation, Crippling Fear can be a powerful spell to cast on the enemy's carry. While most carries will build Black King Bar in order to ignore disables, catching an enemy without a BKB with this spell will not only silence them, but will prevent them from easily retaliating with their attacks.<br/><br/>While it is very weak in the daytime, Crippling Fear can still buy a small window of opportunity if cast on the right target. Even though Night Stalker is relatively weak during daytime, he can still disable the enemy with his spells if forced to.<br/><h4>Hunter in the Night</h4>Hunter in the Night empowers Night Stalker's attack speed and movement speed superbly during the night, making him a very powerful ganker during the earliest parts of the game.<br/><br/>Because it can greatly boost Night Stalker's hunting prowess, Hunter in the Night is best maxed out second among his abilities. The greatly enhanced movement and attack speed is crucial for allowing Night Stalker to chase down and tear apart enemies with his attacks.<br/><br/>With +50 movement speed from most boots, level 4 Hunter in the Night will give Night Stalker a movement speed of 465. A 16% movement speed bonus added on top of that, whether from Phase Boots' active ability or Sange and Yasha, will boost his movement speed to 520, nearly Haste speed. Use this to your advantage to chase enemies down or escape with near impunity.<br/><h4>Darkness</h4>Darkness will reduce the enemy's vision range for its duration, affecting heroes as well as buildings and wards.<br/><br/>As Darkness costs no mana to activate, Night Stalker is free to use it whenever the situation requires it.<br/><br/>Remember that Darkness will reduce all enemy vision to a maximum of 675. This means that heroes with abnormally high night vision such as Luna and Slark will have their vision reduced by almost two-thirds, giving Balanar's team a significant advantage against them.<br/><br/>Because time continues to pass for the duration of the ultimate, Darkness can be most profitably cast whenever it is off cooldown during the daytime. By doing so, you effectively reduce the amount of daytime there is in the game, as daytime will continue to tick down during the darkness. At level 16, the enemy team will only have 90 seconds of daylight out of the 8 minute cycle, effectively reducing daylight to 18.75% of the time.<br/><br/>At night, reserve Darkness for until Night Stalker's team is preparing for a gank. While the enemy will suspect something once the ultimate goes up, reducing their vision range will also affect any Observer Wards that they have placed, meaning that they will be only barely more than 40% effective. This can allow Night Stalker and his team to move under the cover of darkness and bypass Observer Wards that do not explicitly cover travel paths.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Two Gauntlets of Strength greatly increase Night Stalker's base damage, as well as give him more HP to survive enemy harass.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Night Stalker to maintain his early mana pool, particularly since his base intelligence is so low. Keeping his mana up can allow Night Stalker to get last-hits with Void safely.<br/><br/>One each of Tango and Healing Salve are generally recommended in most any lane that Night Stalker is put in.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is a very good starting item to purchase on Night Stalker, as he is a melee hero who can be easily harassed. The damage block can greatly increase his survivability in-lane, and can be later upgraded into a Vanguard.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is a very important item on Night Stalker, as he is very aggressive and must have mana to cast his spells when tower-diving. None of his spells cost more than 150 mana, so having a Magic Stick with full charges guarantees that Night Stalker will always have enough mana to cast something if he needs it.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are critical for Night Stalker to pick up before the first nightfall. As Hunter in the Night increases his base movement speed by a certain percentage, increasing Night Stalker's base movement speed will grant him unparalleled mobility at night.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a very useful item on Night Stalker, as he is a very active ganker who can get charges easily. The extra strength gives him more HP and damage, while the mana regeneration helps him to maintain his mana pool. Urn charges can be used to heal Night Stalker and his teammates after a successful gank, allowing him to quickly be ready for another, or to add extra damage to an enemy to secure a kill.<br/><br/>Bottle is a must for Night Stalker if he is played as a mid. As he has a small mana pool, getting a rune will replenish a large fraction of his mana, allowing him to cast his spells to their utmost during a gank. Even in the late game, his high mobility from Hunter in the Night and superior night vision allows him to spot and grab both runes in quick succession while roaming.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is very good to buy on Night Stalker for all the same reasons as Magic Stick. In addition to the stats, instantly replenishing your HP and mana by 255 can drastically increase your resilience and ability to cast spells.<br/><br/>Phase Boots provide Night Stalker with both a nice speed boost and extra damage, both of which synergize extremely well with Hunter in the Night. The extra damage is greatly augmented by the ability's attack speed bonus, while the active can be combined with Hunter in the Night to boost Night Stalker's movement speed to the limit.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to carry on Night Stalker at all times, as it can allow him to move around the map to react to gank opportunities more easily.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a very powerful item to build as it removes terrain restrictions on Night Stalker's night vision, allowing him to take full advantage of his mobility and giving him a critical edge in situational awareness, particularly when Darkness is active. It also gives him more HP and mana, making him tankier and giving him more mana to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Vanguard greatly increases Night Stalker's resilience by increasing the size of his health pool and giving him damage block, which can be useful early in the game when diving towers for kills. The increased health regeneration also helps him to stay topped up between ganks. Can be later upgraded into a Crimson Guard or an Abyssal Blade.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Heart of Tarrasque greatly increases the size of Night Stalker's health pool, making him much harder to bring down in fights. The extra strength gives him more base damage as well, and the passive health regeneration allows him to always begin fights at full health, allowing him to be more active on the map.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass gives Night Stalker both offensive and defensive power. The extra armor makes him much tankier, synergizing well with his high strength growth, and the attack speed bonus combines with the enemy armor reduction to greatly improve Night Stalker's physical damage output.<br/><br/>Black King Bar makes Night Stalker immune to most crowd control and disables in teamfights, while giving him more HP and attack damage. It allows him to bring down key targets without worrying about being disabled.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian gives Night Stalker many useful bonuses at a very cost-effective price. The +25 strength from the active boosts both his attack damage and HP, drastically increasing his DPS alongside Hunter in the Night, and the health loss can be mitigated with Urn of Shadows.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd can be used in conjunction with Crippling Fear to completely prevent an enemy from fighting back. It also provides a chance to proc Lesser Maim on an enemy, further slowing their attack and movement speed on top of Void.<br/><br/>Skull Basher, which can be upgraded into Abyssal Blade, can be used in conjunction with Night Stalker's naturally high attack speed during night to reliably proc a stun on an important target. This can allow Night Stalker to tear his targets apart with his high DPS while saving Void for another target if needed.<br/><br/>Satanic gives Night Stalker more HP and damage, giving him survivability, more DPS, as well as lifesteal to keep him at full HP. The active allows him to heal himself back up to full health in the middle of a teamfight, so long as he is not disabled, making him a much bigger threat.<br/><br/>Moon Shard gives Night Stalker lots of attack speed, making him a powerful threat even in the daytime. The passive night vision bonus boosts his already great night vision, allowing him to spot enemies from extreme ranges.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb gives Night Stalker a blend of self-sustain and survivability through the HP and mana regen as well as the additional armor. The active can discourage enemies from casting targeted spells on him, making him a bigger threat in teamfights and preventing gank targets from easily disabling him to escape.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius is a good early item for Night Stalker. It gives him more armor and some bonus damage, making him tankier and increasing his last-hitting power. The flat mana regen helps to keep his mana pool topped up, particularly given his low base intelligence. The item can be disassembled and recycled for components, or upgraded into a Vladmir's Offering.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom can be a useful attack modifier to build on Night Stalker, as adding 12% movement speed slow to Void's 50% can greatly reduce the target's chances of escaping. It can be upgraded into an Eye of Skadi as needed, or sold for more inventory space for other items.<br/><br/>Power Treads can be useful to consider on Night Stalker over Phase Boots, as attribute switching can allow Night Stalker to extend his mana pool and improve the value of his Bottle, as well as retain some measure of attack speed during the day when Hunter in the Night is not active.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger greatly extends Night Stalker's reach when initiating. As he has abnormally high night vision, Night Stalker can spot targets from very long distances, allowing him to instantly close the gap on a foe who isn't even aware of his presence.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a good mid-game support/utility item to pick up for your team, as it augments the attack power of all nearby allies and gives them armor. As well, it can provide lifesteal for your team, giving you more survivability in a teamfight. As an item for Night Stalker himself, it gives him mana regen and allows him to maintain his HP by lifestealing when farming neutral camps.<br/><br/>Solar Crest is a strong utility item that gives Night Stalker armor and evasion, hardening his resistance against right-clicks, as well as mana regen to sustain his mana pool. The active can significantly reduce a gank target's armor and induce a miss chance that stacks alongside Crippling Fear, reducing their ability to fight back and increasing the damage they take from Night Stalker's right-clicks.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha provides many useful benefits, as it increases Night Stalker's attack speed, damage, health, and movement speed by large amounts. In particular, the constant 16% movement speed bonus means that he can move at a constant 520 movement speed when combined with Hunter in the Night, greatly increasing his mobility.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is a strong ganking item that gives Night Stalker a good combination of bonuses, and is particularly useful against enemies with powerful passive abilities. It gives him more damage output from his right-clicks, as well as a nice boost to his attributes. The Shadow Walk, combined with Hunter in the Night, allows him to gank while moving at maximum speed, inflicting bonus damage and a break on any enemies he finds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Omniknight is a defensive support who specializes in healing his allies with Purification and shielding them from damage with Repel and Guardian Angel. Unlike most other supports, he remains relevant in the late game as his abilities lack the type of scaling that makes them irrelevant against farmed enemies. Omniknight is generally played as a safe-lane support, but he can occasionally be played as an off-laner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely powerful defensive abilities.<br/><br/>Relatively tanky support.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Constant mana problems.<br/><br/>Very vulnerable to silence.<br/><br/>Abilities can be purged.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Omniknight should be built for survivability and focus on what is best to counter the enemy lineup. If they have lots of AoE dmg or silences, Guardian Greaves is best and most common on support Omniknights, since it can keep your team up longer and purge most debuffs.<br/><br/>Due to his longer than normal cast animations, playing Omniknight well requires good positioning and planning ahead, as any hesitation can prevent him from getting his spells off in time.<br/><br/>Omniknight is actually quite squishy without his own buffs applied to himself, which is why he needs to be in the back of the line of fire, or needs good counter items to keep him in the front of the fight. Items such as Mekansm or Lotus Orb.<br/><br/>Since Omniknight is a melee support, he is incapable of harassing enemy off-laners effectively, and in turn can be prevented from supporting his lane through enemy harass.<br/><br/>Silences are one of Omniknight's greatest weaknesses past the laning stage, as he must be able to cast his abilities in order to impact teamfights. Pre-emptively casting Repel on yourself can prevent the enemy from disabling you, although good positioning also stops enemies from initiating on Omniknight.<br/><br/>Beware that while Omniknight's spells are very strong and can change the course of teamfights, Guardian Angel can be purged. This makes dispels that affect a large area, such as Tornado and Dispel Magic, one of Omniknight's greatest weaknesses, since it will negate his ultimate entirely when targeted properly. Also, dispels from items like Diffusal Blade and Eul's Scepter of Divinity will remove the buff from a single unit.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Purification</h4>Purification is usually maxed out first.<br/><br/>Used offensively, Purification can be used as a damage nuke. Casting the spell on an ally who is engaging an enemy at melee range can cause up to a 600 HP difference shift between the two, often enough to completely change the situation in favor of your team.<br/><br/>The target for Purification does not always have to be an allied hero. Used in-lane, Purification can be cast to gain last-hits, or to harass melee enemies by dealing pure damage to them as they attempt to last-hit. However, both abilities are best reserved for the off-lane as profligate nuking can push the creep wave towards the enemy tower.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, at low levels Purification does not heal very much and costs a moderate amount of mana. Therefore, it is not recommended to use it solely for topping up a teammate during the laning phase after taking damage from enemy harass, but rather in dire situations where you want to save an ally from death, need a pure damage nuke to finish an enemy, or both at the same time.<br/><br/>Remember that Purification cannot be cast on spell immune allies, so casting Repel first prevents you from healing them. If there is enough time, cast Purification on an ally first, then Repel.<br/><br/>Purification has a faster cast time than Omniknight's other spells, requiring 0.25 seconds to cast instead of 0.5, and has a longer cast range than Repel. It should be used first on a teammate who has been initiated on, and then followed by Repel if needed.<br/><h4>Repel</h4>Repel is a very powerful spell in that it can be cast on allies in the early game, when nobody on either team has enough gold to purchase a Black King Bar. Use this to your advantage to get off early ganks and win early teamfights by giving your teammates an advantage that they normally would not have.<br/><br/>Due to its utility, at least one value point in Repel can be very strong in the laning stage. It can be used to escape enemy ganks and protect allies who are jumped on, foiling their kill attempts and greatly increasing the survivability of your lane.<br/><br/>Even in the late game, Repel is a very strong ability, as it is capable of removing debuffs from allies prior to granting them spell immunity, as well as being immune from being dispelled itself.<br/><br/>Use Repel on disabled allies who might not have time to activate their Black King Bar.<br/><br/>One of the strongest aspects of Repel is that it not only has a 18 second cooldown, but does not decrease in potency over use. This allows it to be used much more frequently, and in all types of situations. Using Repel during a gank can allow a teammate to initiate without fear of being disabled and the target escaping, using it during an initiation can allow a teammate who has a BKB to save it for later or to extend the duration of spell immunity further, and using it during an escape can save a teammate whose Black King Bar may be on cooldown, increasing their odds of survival.<br/><br/>At maximum level, Repel lasts for 7 seconds and has a 18 second cooldown. This can be useful in the late game when a Black King Bar has been reduced to its minimum duration of 5 seconds.<br/><br/>Use Repel on a carry or initiator before engaging a teamfight.<br/><br/>Use Repel on yourself to safely venture into hostile territory when placing wards.<br/><h4>Degen Aura</h4>The greatest use for Degen Aura is as an enemy inhibitor, both when initiating on an enemy and escaping. The movement speed slow can prevent an enemy from easily running away, or stop them from easily chasing, and the attack speed slow can reduce the enemy's ability to use physical attacks to deal damage.<br/><br/>In practice, Degen Aura can only be constantly utilized by directly engaging an enemy with Omniknight's attacks. While the debuff persists for 1 second after an enemy leaves its radius, the aura's small radius means that Omniknight must get very close to them in order to affect them with it.<br/><br/>Despite its small numbers, Degen Aura's greatest strength is that the slow can be stacked with other slows, and Omniknight does not need to expend any mana or target enemies in order to inflict them with the debuff. This allows it to always be a factor in battles where Omniknight is present.<br/><br/>When inflicting an enemy with Degen Aura, the most efficient way to slow them down is to get close enough to apply the debuff to them, and then walk ahead of them to body-block their path and apply any attack modifiers that may slow them further. In escapes this can prevent them from easily chasing a low-health ally, and in ganks it can stop the enemy from getting away.<br/><h4>Guardian Angel</h4>Since it is one of the few abilities that grant immunity to physical damage, Guardian Angel can turn the tide of many battles. However, it also has a very long cooldown, so be sure to reserve it for the right occasion.<br/><br/>Guardian Angel is very effective against any ability that deals physical damage; for example, it can be used to negate Omnislash or Exorcism.<br/><br/>Combined with spell immunity from Repel, heroes can achieve full immunity towards physical and magical damage. Do not worry about casting it before your carries used their Black King Bar or other spell immunity granting spells, since they cannot dispel it.<br/><br/>In general, it is better to use Guardian Angel too early than too late, as Omniknight or his allies may perish before he is able to cast it.<br/><br/>Guardian Angel becomes a global ability should Omniknight have an Aghanim's Scepter on him, allowing him to cast it upon his teammates no matter where he is on the map.<br/><br/>In a very desperate situation and with Aghanim's Scepter, Guardian Angel can be used to save towers and the Ancient from being destroyed by your opponents, though you have to decide if it is worthwhile to sacrifice the ability for saving buildings in lieu of a team engagement. Take note that buildings are only protected against physical damage and will still take damage from abilities like Liquid Fire and Nether Blast.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tangoes are necessary for giving yourself flexibility when healing from enemy harass. Since Purification is so inefficient at low levels, you need a way to regenerate health without sacrificing your mana pool.<br/><br/>Clarity potions greatly help you to maintain lane presence due to Omniknight's small mana pool and costly, spammable spells.<br/><br/>Iron Branches should be taken to fill out any remaining inventory slots. Purchasing two of them allows you to either build a Magic Wand, or complete the two Mekansm components more readily.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection can be helpful in making Omniknight even more durable in-lane by giving him even more armor. It can also be used to complete a Ring of Basilius by purchasing a Sage's Mask from the side shop.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are important on Omniknight as he can use them to take advantage of Degen Aura to slow enemies down, whether while pursuing during a gank or body-blocking chasing enemies attempting to kill your carry. As all of Omniknight's spells are very position-dependent, increasing his movement speed should be a major priority.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is very useful on Omniknight due to his small mana pool. Having the ability to give yourself 150 mana can easily be the difference between being able to cast your spells or not.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius provides mana regeneration and armor to the lane, making things safer for Omniknight and his carry. The mana regen is especially useful as Omniknight's mana pool is particularly small in the laning stage. It can also be disassembled later on and the Sage's Mask recycled to build a Soul Ring.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango is a situationally useful laning item to purchase on Omniknight, as his mana pool is very limited before he can purchase items to allow him to cast his spells. The passive HP regen gives him a measure of health sustain, and consuming it can give him enough mana to cast any of his spells at least one more time in a fight or gank if he runs out of mana.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a useful early-game item to buy, as its slow stacks with that of Degen Aura, slowing a single target's movement speed by up to 46%.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a powerful support item that enhances Omniknight's ability to heal teammates and inflict pure damage. The item grants more strength, increasing Omniknight's HP and base damage, and some mana regen to help him manage his mana pool more efficiently. The active allows Omniknight to utilize yet another heal, or deal more pure damage in fights on top of Purification.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Soul Ring should be the first major item that Omniknight purchases, as its active ability is what allows him to cast Purification more than once every few minutes. By alleviating his mana dependencies, Omniknight can become much more active in teamfights and ganks.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots is necessary to increase size of Omniknight's small mana pool, allowing him more frequent use of his mana-costly abilities. As well, the active ability allows him to replenish his and his team's mana pools, an essential duty for a support hero.<br/><br/>Magic Wand gives Omniknight more stats for little gold, and allows him to replenish 255 health and mana instantly, enough to cast any his spells.<br/><br/>Observer Wards are a general requirement on support heroes, as map vision is a basic key to victory.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scrolls are necessary on Omniknight, as being able to teleport in to save a teammate from a gank with your spells is a major advantage that Omniknight can capitalize on greatly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Mekansm provides Omniknight with a second source of healing, one that affects allies around him, and through spell immunity as well. Its all-around stats and bonus armor also help to increase Omniknight's tankiness, but make sure that your mana pool is large enough to support the use of Mekansm, as it is extremely costly in mana to use.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives Omniknight nearly infinite mana regeneration and a hard disable, greatly increasing his teamfight contribution and his ability to gank targets.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard provides Omniknight with a great amount of armor for durability, and intelligence for increasing the size of his mana pool. Both the active and passive abilities stack with Degen Aura, allowing him to drastically impede enemies' attempts to attack and move around in teamfights.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter upgrades Guardian Angel into a global ability, giving it much greater utility as Omniknight doesn't need to be with his teammates for them to benefit from it, as well as bestowing physical immunity to all allied buildings. It also grants him additional stats, health and mana.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a useful all-around utility aura item to purchase. The armor, HP regen and mana regen aura benefit your team, and the lifesteal and attack damage bonus give them an extra edge.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance, besides giving all-around stats, further speeds Omniknight and his allies' movement and attack speed. The active charges can be used in conjunction with Degen Aura to further create a disparity in movement and attack speed between the respective teams.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is not a typical item to pick up on Omniknight, however, it does provide some strong benefits. The bonus strength and agility give Omniknight more HP and armor, and the bonus movement speed gives him more mobility, which can allow him to get in position to cast spells or apply Degen Aura to enemies. As well, the Greater Maim, which has a greater proc chance due to the extra attack speed that the item gives to Omniknight, allows him to slow enemies down even further with his attacks.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is an expensive luxury item, but can allow Omniknight to wade into the center of battles and cast spells to great effect. As Omniknight is already one of the most durable heroes in the game, increasing the size of his HP pool can make killing him a tremendous chore by the enemy team.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is a strong pickup as it can allow Omniknight to cast Guardian Angel twice, as well as use Purification and Repel in quick succession. However, refreshing your cooldowns is very costly in mana, so it is highly recommended to increase the size of your mana pool first if you intend on building this.<br/><br/>Radiance is very hard to build, but can allow Omniknight to greatly hinder the enemy for as long as he remains alive in teamfights. As he can slow enemies down greatly with Degen Aura and is already quite hard to kill in fights, adding burn damage and more damaging right-clicks can turn him into a damage threat and not simply an inconvenience that prevents his teammates from falling in battle. As well, the Burn aura induces a miss chance on all nearby enemies, reducing their ability to inflict physical damage even more.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves are a very strong item to purchase on Omniknight in the late game, as he often builds a Mekansm and Arcane Boots already. Combining the two items into one inventory slot frees up space for more items in the late game, eliminates Mekansm's mana cost and strengthens its aura even further. As well, the self-dispel can allow Omniknight to instantly remove debuffs from himself that may be preventing him from contributing effectively in teamfights.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a useful item on any support hero, and is no exception on Omniknight. Being able to re-position quickly can allow you to use your spells to greater effect, as you can get within range for casting Purification to deal 360 pure damage to enemies, or instantly apply Degen Aura to a fleeing enemy. As well, it can be cast on fleeing allies to save them from chasing enemies, further augmenting Omniknight's ability to save teammates who are in trouble. The extra intelligence is also useful for increasing the size of your mana pool.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a useful mid-game utility item that can give Omniknight more initiation, utility and protection capability, once he has mitigated his mana deficiency issues. Using the active on an ally can allow them to initiate or gank an enemy, as well as letting them get right next to an enemy to hit them with Purification. If a teammate is initiated on by the enemy, using the active on them can give them extra magic resistance and give them temporary invisibility. Finally, Repel can be used as a last-ditch measure to remove debuffs from an invisible ally, such as Dust of Appearance.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is a strong utility item that boosts Omniknight's casting capabilities, and can be assembled more quickly by using the Energy Booster from a disassembled Arcane Boots. It provides HP regen that aids in Omniknight's survivability, and the increased cast range allows him to use Purification and Repel on allies from farther away, greatly increasing the survivability of his teammates.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a good cheap support item that provides many uses. The extra intelligence and mana regeneration ensure that Omniknight almost always has the mana he needs to cast his spells, while the extra movement speed allows him to capitalize on Degen Aura more easily. The active ability can be used to hard-disable an enemy, something that Omniknight otherwise lacks, and then get within range to cast Purification to deal damage to them, or can be cast on yourself to dispel debuffs from yourself (such as silences which may be preventing you from casting your spells).<br/><br/>Necronomicon provides Omniknight with many benefits and adds to his pushing and teamfight contribution. The bonus strength and intelligence increase his health and mana, making him more resilient and able to cast his spells, while the active ability allows him to contribute more strongly in teamfights, or provide True Sight once it is fully upgraded.<br/><br/>Solar Crest is a situationally useful utility item on many support heroes, and synergizes with Omniknight's abilities as well. It gives scaling mana regen, more armor and evasion, greatly increasing Omniknight's survivability against physical damage. The active can transfer the armor and evasion bonuses to a teammate, protecting them even more on top of Purification and Repel, or used on an enemy to inflict them with reduced armor and a miss chance that stacks alongside Degen Aura to greatly reduce their ability to inflict physical damage.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is useful for protecting Omniknight and his team against magical damage in a teamfight, thus ensuring that he can cast his spells to their utmost and apply Degen Aura to the enemy for longer. The active ability also synergizes with his ability to protect his teammates from harm.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb is a strong utility item that allows Omniknight to greatly hinder enemies' attempts to focus down him or a teammate. The item's bonuses give Omniknight more armor and mana regen, increasing his durability and letting him cast his spells more frequently. Using Echo Shell on himself or a teammate in a fight allows him to use his enemies' disables and magic nukes against themselves, slowing the pace of a battle down and giving him more time to use his defensive spells.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard is a good pickup for giving Omniknight more resistance against physical damage, as he is a melee hero who must get close to the enemy to apply Degen Aura's debuff to them. However, its main use is in the active, Guard, which gives damage block and armor to all nearby teammates, very useful if you need to give them survivability against physical damage while your ultimate is on cooldown or you want to save it for more important situations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phoenix is a risk-reward, spell-dependent supportive initiator adept at placing debuffs on a wide area to hamper the enemy team's offensive capabilities and slowly burn their health away. Its abilities let it apply powerful slows, rain down heavy damage over time from a distance, and then cover a large area in a stellar inferno as it collapses into a scorching Supernova. Should enemies fail to destroy or escape it, they will be met with a spell immunity-piercing stun, allowing Phoenix and its allies to take advantage of the enemy and follow up with their other abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Long range on all of its abilities.<br/><br/>Counters auto-attack dependent carries.<br/><br/>Scaling magical damage along with healing.<br/><br/>Capable of inflicting many debuffs on multiple enemies at once.<br/><br/>Deceptively elusive and durable with the right order of spell usage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No true disables.<br/><br/>Has almost no spell immunity piercing effects.<br/><br/>Very ability and mana dependent.<br/><br/>Requires precise and careful positioning, aim and timing.<br/><br/>Low armor and has health costs along with mana costs on most abilities.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Quick timing, good positioning, order and aim are necessary for the perfect initiation as Phoenix. Cast Fire Spirits beforehand, concealing yourself from the enemy team so they will not expect your initiation, then try to Dive through as many enemy units as you can to inflict the movement speed slow debuff. During the Dive, try to cast Fire Spirits on as many heroes as possible and, if available, cast Veil of Discord and Shiva's Guard just right before you cast Supernova. If done in the right order and with quick enough casting, the Supernova would end up right in the middle of the fray, preventing the enemy from stunning you. Most, if not all, enemy units will be afflicted with all your debuffs, taking amplified damage and crippled with the slows, making the Supernova incredibly difficult to kill and/or flee from. Should an enemy stay within the ultimate's area for the whole duration, the enemy could take a total of, more or less, 1850 magical damage (provided the enemy has the base 25% magic resistance, with Veil of Discord's debuff factored in, adding 100 more damage if the +65 Fire Spirits DPS talent is chosen).<br/><br/>Mana, armor and health regeneration are all Phoenix lacks but so direly needs. Consider buying Intelligence items to increase your mana pool, armor-increasing items for more survivability, and health regen items to "refund" the health costs its abilities use.<br/><br/>If playing aggressively as an initiator, Phoenix is best played at either middle lane or offlane, where it can go solo and have as much gold and experience as it can get. Harass your lane opponents with your debuffs to prevent your opponents from obtaining last hits and denying you from your own.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>General</h4>Remember to keep at least 310 mana on Phoenix at all times, so that you have enough to use Fire Spirits and Supernova should the need arise. Try not to waste too much mana with your spells as lacking these abilities to use can make escaping difficult if Icarus Dive is unavailable. Defend yourself by activating Fire Spirits, applying them quickly to enemies and then cast Supernova to protect yourself. If done right, you will be reborn with refreshed abilities, health and mana, as well as stunned opponents, letting you Dive away to safety.<br/><br/>Phoenix' non-ultimate abilities are very weak at level 1. Try to get to level 3 first to obtain a level 2 Fire Spirits/Sun Ray to harass the enemy with. Supernova is also rather fragile at level 1, so great caution must be taken when using the ability at low levels.<br/><br/>All of Phoenix' abilities, except for its ultimate, have health costs along with mana costs (except Icarus Dive). With this in mind, be wary of the enemy team if you're spamming abilities in a lane. While the health costs are always based on your current health (and therefore, you can never kill yourself with it), it will decrease your health to a considerable amount from full, making you a tempting target for a gank. As such, ward your jungles (or ask an ally to do so), or simply have an escape prepared should you find yourself ambushed.<br/><br/>Phoenix does not have any targeted abilities and have very good range and radii, making it good for area denial, scouting or teamfight contribution all from a safe distance.<br/><br/>Phoenix does the most damage when it manages to apply all its debuffs (and any of those from items it has bought) onto its target, slowly whittling them down. Being highly dependent on debuffs, be wary of enemies that have dispelling abilities like Press the Attack or Aphotic Shield.<br/><h4>Icarus Dive</h4>Icarus Dive has no mana cost, meaning it can be used any time it's off cooldown and not silenced.<br/><br/>Be wary of silences while Diving, as it will prevent you from cancelling the dive and result in you turning back to where you started.<br/><br/>Also take care of roots, as this prevents you from casting the Dive. However, getting rooted during the Dive does not cancel it.<br/><br/>You can attack, use abilities and items while Diving. Try to finish off an enemy by applying its debuff, getting to land a few attacks and perhaps use other abilities/items such as Fire Spirits or Urn of Shadows, then let yourself circle back to your original location.<br/>Phoenix does not need to turn to use abilities/items while Diving, so they can be used in quick succession regardless of where you are in the Dive.<br/><br/><h4>Fire Spirits</h4>Always try to apply the Fire Spirits debuff on all enemy Heroes before using Supernova, so that destroying it will at the very least, be slow to make the most use of it.<br/><br/>Remember that Fire Spirits does not stack with itself. Try to spend the four spirits wisely so that you can make most of the ability for its entire duration.<br/><br/>The spirits have a fixed movement speed, and therefore take some time to reach their destination. Try to lead your aim so that it can hit a moving enemy, or try to predict where the enemy might move to next. This also means that firing the spirits from its maximum distance (especially if cast range is increased) will delay their impact further compared to firing from a closer distance.<br/><br/>The attack speed slow can be enough to completely nullify an auto-attacker Hero for a meanwhile. If you are suddenly ganked, try to apply the debuff on your assailants, and perhaps try to turn the fight around or escape.<br/><br/>The attack speed slow also works on Roshan. Accompany an ally and help out by casting it on Roshan, making sure to use the Spirits one after the other's debuff to make full use of them.<br/><h4>Sun Ray</h4>Reserve Sun Ray for healing purposes or if there is a fleeing enemy within reach. Sun Ray is fairly weak when the enemy is at or is close to full health.<br/><br/>The damage/heal increases the longer the Ray is activated, so try to keep the Ray pointed at an enemy/ally for maximum efficiency.<br/><br/>Sun Ray's heal is not as quick acting as other heals, therefore it is best to be used while an ally is being attacked at full health instead of using it as a last-ditch save attempt.<br/><br/>Sun Ray gives vision along its path. Use it to scout areas such as Roshan's pit, above cliffs, or the juke areas inside trees where enemy Heroes would tend to hide in.<br/><br/>Be careful of the enemy team when you're channeling the Sun Ray. Even with the toggled movement, you are a very easy target for skillshots like Meat Hook or Sacred Arrow. Try to hide behind allies or be in a hard to reach area so you cannot be hit by such spells while still contributing to fights.<br/><br/>When movement is toggled on, Phoenix can fly over cliffs and destroy trees, as well as be unaffected by any sort of slows. Depending on the situation, it can be used to escape a gank or a failed teamfight to get yourself to safety. You can use it to fly over Ice Shards or Fissure, to break free from Pounce's leash or Kinetic Field, or to ignore the slows from Ice Wall or Fortune's End. During the toggled movement, you are also immune to roots like Earthbind and Ensnare; however, beware of Frostbite, as even though it is also a rooting ability, it applies a ministun upon cast, so it can stop the movement, but it won't prevent it.<br/>Phoenix can still cast abilities and items while firing the Sun Ray. A wise escape tactic can be to toggle the Ray's movement on (preferably through a cliff) and then teleport back to base while moving so enemies may have a harder time trying to stop you from escaping.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Tangoes and a Healing Salve are basic starting game health regeneration items that are much more useful on Phoenix as all of its non-ultimate abilities have health costs.<br/><br/>Clarity is enough to let Phoenix regain enough mana if it spams Fire Spirits or Sun Ray too much early game.<br/><br/>Iron Branches give Phoenix much needed stats, as well as be later built into either a Magic Wand or Mekansm.<br/><br/>Wind Lace should be purchased first for Tranquil Boots, as the other parts of the boots can be purchased from the Side Shop.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Tranquil Boots should be Phoenix' choice of footwear as its health regeneration help Phoenix refund the health costs of its abilities, especially when channeling Sun Ray. If Tangoes are still available in your inventory, try using them while the Boots are unbroken so that you gain 21.19 HP regeneration per second instead of the usual 14. The high movement speed will also allow Phoenix to visit lanes and/or enter teamfights as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows helps restore health after successful skills, or perhaps add even more DPS if Phoenix is aggressive and is successful at it. The mana regeneration may be rather small but still proves useful.<br/><br/>Helm of Iron Will should be the first item for Veil of Discord to be bought, as Phoenix is still lacking on armor and health regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Veil of Discord practically removes the base 25% magic resistance that Heroes have, letting Phoenix' abilities deal their full damage. Its added armor, health regeneration and Intelligence are all also good stats to have on Phoenix.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is the main core item on any Phoenix, as both its aura and active possess attack speed slows that aid in the Phoenix Sun's survivability if used right before Supernova. The additional intelligence gives Phoenix a much larger mana pool, and the armor combined with the passive attack speed slow aura gives it much more survivability against physical damage. Using the active blast during Icarus Dive causes the wave to follow Phoenix, allowing it to apply the slow and additional nuke to multiple enemies in a larger area in a short amount of time, and the attack speed slow still works during Supernova​, greatly increasing the odds of success.<br/><br/>Radiance fits a Phoenix performing the initiator role. Not only does it add more damage to Phoenix' output, but the 17% miss chance might make a difference in having a successful Supernova should the enemy decide to focus it down.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is more for a support role Phoenix, turning Supernova into a very powerful "heal". It is more effective on Heroes with long cooldowns on non-ultimate abilities (such as Terrorblade or Invoker) or gets into skirmishes often (such as Sven or Spectre), but saving any ally from certain death should be great enough on its own. Unlike when initiating, Supernova is best preferably used far away from enemy Heroes to increase the chances of having the Sun survive.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Lotus Orb increases Phoenix' survivability considerably by giving it armor and regeneration, both of which it lacks. Its active lets Phoenix purge off silences and other debuffs off of itself, as well as perhaps deter enemy Heroes from placing targeted abilities on it in the first place.<br/><br/>Octarine Core lowers Phoenix' slightly lengthy cooldowns by a considerable amount. It also lets Fire Spirits practically have a very short downtime if they were active for their full duration. The spell lifesteal can also help negating the health costs of Phoenix' abilities.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight gives health regeneration and magic resistance, giving Phoenix and its team even more survivability in teamfights.<br/><br/>Mekansm gives armor and health regeneration, all important to Phoenix. However, Mekansm costs actually more than Supernova, and considering Phoenix' low mana pool early on, you may end up being able to use only one of either, not both.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves fits the support Phoenix much better as its mana cost-free active allows restoration of health and mana to itself and its allies. The increasing health regen upon reaching low health is great for Phoenix and its constantly dwindling health, as well as remove debuffs from itself.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel, for the aggressive Phoenix, offsets is poor base movement speed and give it extra mobility to jump from one lane to another to help out and contribute to teamfights.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque completely negates the health costs of Phoenix' abilities, enabling it to dive deeper into enemy territory and initiate better without risk of dying before using Supernova. However, do remember that upon using Supernova, Heart's health bonuses no longer matter, so be very prudent in deciding which may be better: Using or not using your ultimate.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd can just be the trick for enemy Heroes with quick attack speed, such as Troll Warlord or Clinkz. The additional Strength can also aid in Phoenix' survivability.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos gives health and mana to Phoenix, allowing more ability spam with the increased mana pool, and its active root can help keep enemies in place so they can take the most of your abilities' damage.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives high mana regeneration, allowing Phoenix to spam Fire Spirits and Sun Ray more often. Its active not only purges debuffs, but may also come in handy if Phoenix is silenced during Icarus Dive. Using the active on yourself while Diving and silenced stops Phoenix mid-Dive, preventing Phoenix from circling back to its original location.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb should only be bought if the player is sure on how to make the most of it. It is best to not use Refresher Orb immediately after Supernova as the ultimate already refreshes Phoenix' other abilities, making Refresher's active rather pointless. Instead, spend the other abilities first, then refresh so you may perhaps have a third Icarus Dive/Fire Spirits/Sun Ray to use and a second Supernova to refresh them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Pudge is a fearsome ganker and one of the most renowned heroes in all of Dota. Played skillfully, he can dis-position enemies and set up kills for his team that would be otherwise impossible to accomplish.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has a respectable health pool early game that grows even bigger later on.<br/><br/>Very good ganker and roamer in the early game.<br/><br/>One of the best tanks in the game, capable of being resistant to both magic and physical damage in late part of the game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low armor at the early stages of the game.<br/><br/>Sometimes he's very dependent on his teammates.<br/><br/>Requires skills to land a normal hook, if playing as initiator-tank, a fail hook that supposed to initiate the battle could ruin the whole team fight<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>With his poor base armor and agility, Pudge is quite vulnerable to physical damage in the early game despite being a strength hero, and can be easily harassed down due to being a melee hero. As well, his extremely long attack animation makes him additionally easy to harass by lane opponents, so good positioning and knowledge of creep mechanics is necessary to survive in a lane.<br/><br/>Because of his extremely powerful spells, Pudge is heavily reliant on building up his mana pool and increasing his poor mobility in order to be effective in teamfights. Try to build items that grant Pudge additional movement speed and burst movement to aid in positioning, intelligence items to increase the size of his poor base mana pool, and durability items to take advantage of his high strength growth.<br/><br/>Given his skill set, Pudge can be played in any number of ways.<br/>Traditionally, Pudge is played as a solo mid. While he is generally a weak laner due to being a melee hero, judicious and skillful use of his abilities lets him turn the tables on his lane opponent and score kills to give him an advantage. By being given solo experience and gold, Pudge can get an early level 6 and immediately begin roaming for kills, using his gold to purchase items to aid him to this effect.<br/><br/>Given his strong utility and high strength gain, Pudge can sometimes be played as an off-laner, both solo and with a lane partner. While he lacks the survivability and escape abilities of traditional off-laners, he can greatly disrupt the enemy safe lane with Meat Hook, which can get kills on the enemy supports under optimal circumstances. If partnered with a teammate with good kill potential, Pudge can foul the enemy carry's attempts to farm safely and reduce their effectiveness later in a match.<br/><br/>Lacking other options, Pudge can serve as a strong utility support in the safe lane. While he is unable to effectively harass the enemy off-laner with his spells, he can dis-position them with Meat Hook and slow them with Rot during ganks and kill attempts, giving his team early kills to boost their gold gain. He can also safely and reliably obtain gold and experience through pulling creep camps, which keeps lane creep equilibrium closer to his team's tower where he can more easily get in position to gank them.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Meat Hook</h4>Meat Hook launches a hook that latches onto the first target it contacts, pulling them to his location and dealing Pure damage if it is an enemy or neutral.<br/><br/>Meat Hook is one of the most difficult abilities to use in all of Dota due to the hook's slow travel time, but can be very rewarding as it can put an enemy in an extremely disadvantageous position. Good practice and prediction is mandatory in order to catch enemy heroes with it.<br/>As it deals Pure damage and increases in range as it is leveled up, Meat Hook should generally be the first spell that Pudge maxes out. As well, reducing its cooldown can allow Pudge to cast it more than once in a single engagement, using the spell to catch an enemy and again as a finishing nuke.<br/><br/><br/>The most reliable way to utilize Meat Hook is to cast it from the enemy Fog of War, in order to give them as little time to react as possible. Use treelines, high ground and nighttime to mask Pudge's position.<br/><br/>Because it mini-stuns an enemy target upon contact, Meat Hook can be a very strong spell for interrupting channeling abilities, as its long cast range allows Pudge to target enemies that could otherwise be out of range of other disables. In particular, it can be used to interrupt Town Portal Scroll and stop an enemy from escaping.<br/><br/>What makes Meat Hook so hard to land is that it is capable of latching on to creeps, which makes the skill extremely hard to use in-lane when the enemy also has vision on Pudge's location at all times. As well, it is able to latch on to allied heroes, which can foul teamfights by dispositioning a teammate who wishes to close the distance with the enemy.<br/><br/>Good communication with teammates is mandatory in order to take utmost advantage of Meat Hook. Communicating your intentions with allies ensures that they do not accidentally walk into Pudge's line of fire, and teammates can aid him by landing initiating stuns that allow him to reel in a stationary target. As well, they can position themselves to take advantage of a successful hook, immediately jumping on and bringing down the target.<br/><br/>Be mindful that while Meat Hook can still catch and damage spell immune enemies, it does not mini-stun them. If a spell immune enemy is attempting to teleport away, other disables must be used to interrupt them, particularly your ultimate.<br/>Meat Hook's ability to disposition enemies precisely allows Pudge to aid various teammates in getting kills with otherwise unreliable nukes and disables. For example, standing on top of a large Techies trap can virtually guarantee a kill, while standing in the path of an allied Sacred Arrow can guarantee landing a full-duration stun. Make sure to coordinate with your allies in order to make the most of your ability.<br/><br/><br/>In a pinch, Meat Hook can be used to save allies and not just capture enemies. Targeting allies who are disabled and being focused down by the enemy team can bring them back to a location of safety.<br/><br/>Be careful about the types of enemies you decide to target with Meat Hook, and be especially careful about Pudge's positioning relative to his teammates when doing so. Catching an enemy initiator with a large area disable like Ravage or Reverse Polarity can allow them to disable Pudge's entire team in a worst case scenario. Make sure that the target cannot easily use their new positioning to their advantage, and check on allies' positioning to ensure that they cannot be caught by enemy area disables.<br/><br/>Unlike other disables, Meat Hook can still latch on to invulnerable units, although it does not mini-stun or damage them. This means that it is capable of pulling units out of cyclone, and even manipulating units through Song of the Siren.<br/><br/>In the laning phase, Meat Hook can be used to disposition neutral creeps in order to alter lane creep equilibrium. Hooking a neutral creep to bring it closer to Pudge's lane can draw lane creep aggro, pulling them back to the neutral camp and denying experience and gold to Pudge's lane opponent(s). Beware, however, that Meat Hook's tremendous mana cost and Pudge's meager base mana pool means that it is necessary to utilize Clarity to this effect.<br/><h4>Rot</h4>Rot slows and damages enemies in melee range while also dealing the same damage to Pudge.<br/><br/>Rot allows Pudge to immediately start damaging and slowing any enemies he catches with Meat Hook, preventing them from easily escaping once caught. The slow also gives Pudge a strong movement speed advantage, countering his low base movement speed and allowing him to easily keep them inside the gas cloud.<br/><br/>As a disable and damage nuke, Rot is a good candidate for a spell to be maxed out early next to Meat Hook. The slow and damage can greatly increase Pudge's kill potential in the early game.<br/><br/>If self-damage is a concern, one value point in Rot can allow Pudge to retain his disable potential, as the slow is the same at all levels.<br/><br/>Rot can act as a last-hitting aid, either by getting a creep within last-hit range or by finishing it off shortly after attacking. Toggling Rot during last-hitting can help Pudge to more easily get gold from last-hits, although a source of HP replenishment is also necessary to mitigate the spell's cost.<br/><br/>As items and spells are queued during Meat Hook's cast backswing, Rot can be cast during Meat Hook's travel time, so that it immediately turns on as the hook starts to retract. This can be a useful time-saver for having Rot ready to greet a hook victim.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Rot can be turned on to deny Pudge in a hopeless situation. Preventing the enemy from profiting from his death can delay them from progressing their items.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Blink Dagger goes on cooldown if Pudge takes damage from Rot. Try to avoid using Rot if you believe that you might need to blink in the near future.<br/><br/>Beware that if Pudge is silenced, Rot cannot be toggled on or off. Being silenced with Rot turned on can cause Pudge to take unnecessary damage from the spell, and make him easier to kill.<br/><br/>As Rot deals its damage in 0.2 second intervals, it is possible to have active Healing Salve, Clarity or Bottle at the same time as Rot up to level 3, provided that no other sources of damage cancel them.<br/><br/>Due to how Rot's damage timings are, it is possible to rapidly toggle Rot on and off several times to drastically reduce damage dealt/taken while still maintaining the slow. This is mainly possible thanks to debuff lingering for 0.5 seconds on all enemies, causing them to get slowed for at least 0.5 seconds, even when Rot was toggled on for shorter. Also, since the damage is also bound to the debuff, they also take at least 2 damage instances from the debuff.<br/><h4>Flesh Heap</h4>Flesh Heap grants Pudge bonus magic resistance and extra strength based on enemy hero deaths around him.<br/><br/>Flesh Heap, with enough stacks, can greatly increase the effectiveness of Rot and Dismember. The additional magic resistance reduces the amount of self-damage Pudge takes from Rot; the strength stacks give him more overall HP for casting Rot, and increase the strength-based damage portion of Dismember.<br/><br/>Because it is retroactive, and only becomes effective with enough stacks, Flesh Heap is a poor ability to put points into in the laning stage, and should generally be reserved for after Meat Hook and Rot are maxed out. Pudge always gains the full benefits of all previous kills/assists, and all stacks always use the current level of Flesh Heap for rewarding bonus strength.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Pudge does not have to get the kill himself in order to gain a stack of Flesh Heap. Assisting in kills, or simply walking within radius of an enemy hero as they die is enough to gain a stack, so showing up to teamfights is greatly beneficial to Pudge, even if his contribution is minimal.<br/><br/>Pudge still gains Flesh Heap stacks outside of its radius if Pudge himself is credited for the kill. This means that killing an enemy with a long ranged Meat Hook, or finishing them off with an Urn of Shadows charge, can still reward Pudge with a stack.<br/><h4>Dismember</h4>Dismember is a channeled disable that deals damage over time to its target based on Pudge's strength, while also healing him for the duration of the channel.<br/>After catching an enemy with Meat Hook, casting Dismember on them with an active Rot can deal tremendous damage to them, and hold them in place for allies to focus them down. The self-heal from Dismember easily counteracts the damage that Pudge takes from Rot, and makes him harder to bring down if the enemy does not have any stuns or silences to interrupt him.<br/><br/><br/>The self-heal from Dismember is independent from the amount of damage that Pudge deals with the spell; even if the target has high magic resistance or otherwise takes no damage from Dismember, Pudge always heals for the full amount based on the duration of the channel.<br/><br/>Dismember can stun its target through spell immunity, so it is a good way to stop an enemy in their tracks even if it deals no damage. Disabling them can waste the duration of their Black King Bar, and reduce its effectiveness later in the match.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Rot can be toggled without breaking the channel. If Rot was not activated prior to casting Dismember, or it needs to be stopped to prevent Pudge from killing himself, it can still be toggled during an active Dismember.<br/><br/>Be mindful that strong dispel can still break a Dismember target out of stun, so abilities like Kraken Shell, Dark Pact and Aphotic Shield can end the channel prematurely. Choose your targets carefully and time the use of the disable so that it does not get wasted.<br/><br/>Dismember provides True Sight over the target for the duration of the channel, meaning that it can catch enemies during invisibility fade time. However, keep in mind that they still turn invisible at the end of the channel, so be sure to carry detection when needed.<br/><br/>If Dismember was cast on an enemy without using Meat Hook, it can be shift-queued to immediately cast at the end of the channel to finish off a target as a Pure damage nuke. This also applies to active item abilities, which can be used to immediately disable a target at the end of a channel if needed.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Dismember can be cast on enemy and neutral creeps in order to restore Pudge's health should the need arise. However, be mindful of the spell's mana cost and try not to use it if you believe that it could be needed in an upcoming gank.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Gauntlets of Strength and Circlet give Pudge good early stats, and build into a Bracer. The improved strength helps with last-hitting and provides some HP, while the agility and intelligence give a small amount of armor and mana.<br/><br/>Healing Salve allows Pudge to replenish his HP from enemy harass, preventing him from being easily harassed out of lane.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Pudge to restore his mana, particularly important as Meat Hook costs a significant amount of mana and being able to cast it more than once in the laning stage allows him to be far more useful.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick gives Pudge burst HP and mana regen. In particular, the mana can allow him to use Meat Hook one more time even if his mana pool is completely empty, which can score crucial kills in critical situations.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed is important to get early on, as Pudge's abysmal movement speed means he has trouble chasing enemies. It allows Pudge to more easily move into position to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Bracer can be easily purchased by upgrading existing Gauntlets of Strength and Circlet. It further improves the stat bonuses that Pudge gets while freeing up an inventory slot.<br/><br/>Bottle is crucial to purchase early on as a mid Pudge, as he is easy to harass and requires HP and mana sustain. As well, the runes can help him to gank enemies more easily, and refill the Bottle's charges to allow Pudge to roam independently.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand gives Pudge additional stats and increased charge storage. Both can greatly aid Pudge in granting him survivability and allowing him to more easily cast spells, as a fully-charged Magic Wand can often be all that he needs in order to pull off his full spell combo.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are cheap, and give Pudge all the bonuses that he needs. The extra armor greatly improves his tankiness and offsets his poor base armor, while the improved movement speed grants increased map mobility and helps him to position for casting Meat Hook from suitable angles. The HP regen keeps his HP topped up, and most importantly mitigates the HP cost of Rot.<br/><br/>Hood of Defiance gives Pudge many strong bonuses at a cost-effective price. It grants magic resistance, reducing the amount of damage that Rot deals to Pudge, and extra HP regen to further mitigate its HP cost. It greatly boosts the effectiveness of Flesh Heap, allowing Pudge to easily shrug off magic nukes and make further use of the bonus strength.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to have on Pudge at all times. Being able to globally re-position around the map to react to enemy movements can give him many more opportunities to gank lone enemies or cripple them in teamfights.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter significantly augments the utility of Meat Hook, greatly reducing its cooldown and increasing its damage. It also provides additional attributes, most importantly more mana to mitigate the strain that repeated casting of Meat Hook places on Pudge's mana pool.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is a very strong utility item that increases Pudge's overall lethality. It increases the size of his mana pool, as well as providing HP regen to help mitigate the health cost of Rot. Its main utility, however, is in increasing Meat Hook's range up to 1500, allowing him to snag enemies from further away, as well as increasing the damage that all of his spells deal.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is extremely powerful on Pudge due to his ganking nature. It provides strength for additional HP and base damage, and mana regen to help maintain his mana pool. Charges can be easily acquired through successful ganks, and can be utilized either to heal Pudge and his teammates after successful ganks, particularly to recoup the HP cost of Rot, or can be targeted on enemies as an additional damage nuke to increase the odds of success of future ganks.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Pipe of Insight can be upgraded from Hood of Defiance, and provides teamfight utility to Pudge's team. Insight Aura further boosts Pudge's magic resistance and HP regen, while the active can improve teammates' survivability against enemy magic nukes.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos improves Pudge's disable potential while providing many strong bonuses at a cost-effective price. The increased intelligence greatly boosts Pudge's ability to cast his spell combo, while the increased HP makes him even tankier. The active's long range allows Pudge to drastically slow an enemy from far away, making them easy targets for Meat Hook.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is extremely powerful in Pudge's hands, allowing him to easily position himself for casting Meat Hook. It should be considered a core item if farm permits.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque greatly improves Pudge's strength and HP, making him far more difficult to kill and augmenting the amount of damage that Dismember deals. The passive also allows him to quickly regenerate HP between engagements, and allows him to ignore the HP cost of Rot.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard greatly improves Pudge's survivability against physical damage. The bonus armor and enemy attack speed reduction make Pudge much tankier, while the bonus intelligence greatly improves his ability to cast spells over prolonged periods of time. The active can act as a damage nuke and slow, allowing Pudge to further reduce enemies' movement speed on top of Rot.<br/><br/>Force Staff is an easily built support-utility item that greatly improves Pudge's mobility while providing useful bonuses. The intelligence helps him with casting his spells, while the HP regen aids in mitigating Rot's HP cost. The active allows Pudge to re-position himself for casting Meat Hook, save allies who are fleeing from enemies, and even break an enemy's Linken's Sphere prior to casting Dismember.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Pudge all-around stats and can be easily purchased by upgrading an already owned Bracer. In particular, the extra intelligence aids with casting, while the aura boosts his movement speed to aid with positioning and chasing.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb is a very strong survivability and disabling item that allows Pudge to use the enemy's spells against them. It provides HP and mana regen, both of which are very useful for maintaining Pudge's health and mana, while the bonus armor aids in survivability against physical damage. Echo Shell can be cast on allies to discourage enemies from targeting them with spells, or can be cast on Pudge himself prior to Dismember to allow him to reflect enemy disables should they try to interrupt him.<br/><br/>Observer Ward and Sentry Ward can be very important to purchase on Pudge in order to allow him to be effective. Having vision on the enemy allows him to easily position himself to hit them with Meat Hook, and taking away enemy vision prevents them from spotting his approaches, making it more difficult for them to avoid his attempts to cast Meat Hook.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is a useful item to purchase when going mid or off-lane. It greatly mitigates the harass damage that Pudge takes from his lane opponent, increasing his survivability and allowing him to lane more easily.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom can be a strong utility purchase when playing in the side lane. Adding an additional slow on top of Rot can greatly inhibit an enemy's movement speed, greatly increasing the odds of securing a kill.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius is a strong early purchase when playing as a side lane Pudge. The increased armor helps mitigate Pudge's weakness against physical damage, while the flat mana regen greatly improves Pudge's mana sustain due to his poor base intelligence. It can be disassembled and both components recycled; the Ring of Protection can be built into Tranquil Boots, while the Sage's Mask can be built into a utility item.<br/><br/>Gem of True Sight can be a wise investment on Pudge depending on the enemy lineup. Pudge's inherent tankiness ensures that it does not easily fall into enemy hands, and the detection allows him to de-ward enemy vision and catch invisible heroes more easily.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots are a more expensive investment than Tranquil Boots, but can increase Pudge's utility and independent roaming if he can secure an alternate source of HP regen. Improving the size of Pudge's mana pool allows him to more easily utilize his spells, and the mana replenishment allows him to give himself and his teammates more mana as needed.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape can be a useful utility item in Pudge's hands. Improving Pudge's magic resistance reduces the impact of Rot on his HP pool, while the active can aid in invisible initiations and escapes, for allies and Pudge himself. The active also lets Pudge shield himself while channeling Dismember, reducing the odds of enemies hitting him with targeted disables.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a useful survivability item on Pudge. It boosts his armor, giving him survivability against physical damage, and boosts his intelligence to give him more mana for casting spells. The active allows Pudge to use his large HP pool offensively during ganks and teamfights, discouraging enemies from casting counter-nukes against him.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord can be a good damage booster item that gives Pudge additional utility. It gives him stats across the board and a large amount of intelligence, as well as additional armor and HP regen. The active reduces enemies' magic resistance, causing them to take more damage from Rot and Dismember, and can boost the damage that allies' magic nukes deal as well.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a useful utility teamfight item that boosts Pudge's survivability. Its aura grants armor and bonus damage, which benefit Pudge and his allies in teamfights, while the HP regen, mana regen and lifesteal allow Pudge to maintain himself between fights.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a useful utility item that helps Pudge with getting his spells off. The intelligence and mana regen ensure that Pudge always has the mana to cast his spells, and the increased movement speed grants him more mobility to position himself for casting Meat Hook or chasing with Rot. The active can instantly hard-disable an enemy at range, and can be followed up with an easy Meat Hook. It can also be cast on Pudge himself to remove debuffs while providing temporary invulnerability.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard is a strong utility item that gives Pudge more teamfight contribution. His tanky nature means that he greatly benefits from the damage block and bonus armor, while the bonus HP helps to make him even harder to kill. The active gives damage block to his entire team, useful for increasing their survivability during a teamfight.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves give Pudge increased survivability and teamfight utility. The heal and mana replenishment greatly aid Pudge and his allies in teamfights, and the aura tremendously improves survivability. The active also removes debuffs from Pudge instantly, allowing him to contribute more effectively in teamfights.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is an expensive investment, but greatly improves Pudge's ganking prowess. It gives a great amount of intelligence and mana regen, ensuring that Pudge can cast his disables whenever needed. The Hex allows him to instantly hard-disable an enemy at range, which makes them an easy victim for a follow-up Dismember without needing to immediately expend Meat Hook.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade works well with Pudge, as it makes targets take additional magic damage, does 75 base magic and 2x your attribute (Strength, in Pudge's case), and slows down enemy heroes by 80% for 3 seconds. If going against a physical carry, you can also Ether Blast yourself without the slow penalty for 4 seconds. Keep in mind you still take additional magic damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sand King is an Initiator, escaper, and a carry if you have enough gold to do so.He suffers from low initial damage but compensates with his semi-nuke passive (An attack modifier).<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Stuns that can be used as both, initiation and escape<br/><br/>Provides a good AoE in the game which is devastating early-game<br/><br/>Great in laning phases with his passive<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has little health pool that can be taken advantage of by nukes<br/><br/>Ultimate scales poorly into late game<br/><br/>Low mana pool makes spellcasting in early game difficult<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Generally, Sand King is played as a support hero who transitions into an initiator-utility once the laning stage ends. As such, he generally performs support duties for his team during the laning stage, such as purchasing Observer Wards and/or the Animal Courier, as well as upgrading the courier and purchasing Smoke of Deceit when needed.<br/><br/>If needed, Sand King can also be played as an early off-laner, as Burrowstrike and Sand Storm offer him measures of escape, and he generally needs levels before he can farm for gold to get his items. Even if he does not get farm in the off-lane, reaching level 3 or 4 can allow him to transition into his jungle to farm neutral camps with Sand Storm.<br/><br/>Sand King's greatest strengths are his instant cast times and high-mobility spells that allow him to initiate or escape without worrying about cast animations. He can be a very deadly ganker who is nearly impossible to escape, or an extremely slippery target who can evade even the most determined ganks.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Burrowstrike</h4>Burrowstrike is a very strong initiating spell that can instantly disable a target while also displacing Sand King. It is generally the skill that Sand King picks first and maxes out by level 7, as it disables its target for over 2 seconds at all levels and can be used for initiating and escaping.<br/><br/>Be mindful that while Burrowstrike is a Pseudo-Blink spell, it has a deceptively short range, especially at level 1. As such, it requires Sand King to get very close to his target before casting.<br/><br/>Remember that Burrowstrike can displace Sand King over impassible terrain, such as cliff faces. As such, the spell can be used to traverse cliffs to chase or escape, giving Sand King extremely strong mobility starting at level 1.<br/><br/>Part of what makes Burrowstrike so deadly is that it is a unit-target spell, allowing Sand King to reliably stun any unit within the spell's radius with zero warning. Combined with a Blink Dagger, Sand King is capable of instantly stunning any enemy within 2000 range, giving them no opportunity to cast any escape spells.<br/><br/>In the same vein, the combination of Blink Dagger and Burrowstrike can make Sand King extremely mobile, as he effectively has two blink spells at his disposal. Combined with the ability to traverse unpathable terrain, Sand King can chase or escape without limit.<br/><br/>It is a good and deadly by first stun and use the ultimate.<br/><h4>Sand Storm</h4>Sand Storm is a channeled spell that summons a sandstorm to deal damage in a radius around Sand King while providing him with invisibility.<br/><br/>Against opponents without detection, Sand Storm is a very strong evasion spell as it can shield Sand King from physical attacks and unit-targeted spells. However, beware that area-targeted disables, particularly stuns and silences, can still hit Sand King and interrupt the channeling, moreso since Sand King must remain stationary in the center of the storm while channeling.<br/><br/>Sand Storm can be a strong escape spell in the early game due to the invisibility, as opponents may not have detection to target you. However, it is unwise to rely on this to protect you as smart opponents will bring detection if they come to gank you.<br/><br/>Once Sand Storm is level 2 or higher, Sand King can use the spell to jungle, as the damage it deals is enough to allow Sand King to kill large jungle camps reliably. The invisibility the spell grants him allows him to damage the creeps without taking any damage himself, and Sand Storm itself costs small amounts of mana and decreases greatly in cooldown as it is leveled. This can allow Sand King to reliably farm up an early Blink Dagger if his jungle is not already taken and his safe lane does not need any assistance.<br/><br/>Remember that Sand Storm will retain a 1.5 second invisibility buff on Sand King and keep the sand cloud up for the same duration once Sand King stops channeling the spell. This can be used to misdirect foes and give you time to escape, since they may attempt to target the center of the sand cloud while you are already moving away.<br/><br/>If there is no detection nearby, Sand Storm can be used to disjoint spells and projectiles. This is particularly strong since Sand Storm has an instant cast time, as well as an extremely short cooldown at level 4, allowing Sand King to use it to mask his movements without breaking stride.<br/><br/>When initiating with your Epicenter-Burrowstrike combo, it can be smart to add Sand Storm to your combo since it deals a surprising amount of damage at level 4, so even channeling it for one second can add at least 100 damage.<br/><h4>Caustic Finale</h4>Caustic Finale is generally considered to be Sand King's weakest early-game ability, however it is a deceptively strong one that gives Sand King immense nuking power once he has enough levels in it.<br/><br/>Caustic Finale's greatest strength is that it allows Sand King to deal magic nuke damage simply by using his right-clicks, and without the need to expend any mana. Additionally, the amount of nuking damage the spell deals scales linearly with the number of creeps that Sand King attacks, meaning that he can deal upwards of 1100 magic damage inside of a few seconds by attacking only 5 creeps and finishing them off to trigger the on-death explosion. This makes Sand King an extremely strong pusher and counter-pusher who can single-handedly stop even a lane of Mega-Creeps from pushing into his base.<br/><br/>Caustic Finale can be a very good flash-farming spell, allowing Sand King to add even more nuke damage when farming creep waves. With an early level in Caustic Finale and combined with Sand Storm, Sand King can clear creep waves and jungle camps surprisingly quickly.<br/><br/>Never discount the slowing power of Caustic Finale. If you manage to catch an enemy near creeps, initiate with Burrowstrike and then apply Caustic Finale to any nearby creeps as well as the enemy player before channeling Sand Storm. This will not only increase the amount of nuke damage they take, but also slow them down for your teammates to catch up and finish the job.<br/><br/>In the laning stage, Caustic Finale can be a strong pickup if you are against a melee enemy hero, particularly when playing in the off lane. By applying the debuff to all of the enemy's creeps, you can threaten not only a slow, but also a tremendous amount of magic damage to the enemy any time they walk up for last-hits. This also has the further effect of pushing your creep wave into the enemy tower, forcing them to tank creep attacks and fight against their own tower for last-hits.<br/><h4>Epicenter</h4>Epicenter is Sand King's signature ability and one of the most iconic and devastating spells in all of Dota. While it has an extended channeling time and can be easily interrupted, it has a tremendous amount of lockdown and deals large amounts of damage if it can be successfully cast, allowing Sand King to wipe entire teams by himself under the right circumstances.<br/><br/>The key to getting a successful Epicenter off involves getting a Blink Dagger and shift-queuing orders. Begin channeling Epicenter, then shift-queue your Blink Dagger and then Burrowstrike during the 2-second channeling time (as well as any other spells and items such as Veil of Discord and Shiva's Guard). Once the channeling is finished, Sand King will take advantage of his instant cast times to immediately blink into range and then Burrowstrike without delay, stunning the enemy at the same instant that they begin taking the brunt of the Epicenter damage. This can be followed up with a channeled Sand Storm to deal even more damage.<br/><br/>If time and targets permit, try to use Sand King's attacks to apply Caustic Finale to any creeps caught in an Epicenter initiation. Simply inflicting them with the debuff will greatly increase Sand King's nuking power during an initiation, as the creeps will have already been inflicted with Burrowstrike damage and are under the effects of Epicenter, ensuring their quick demise and dealing the full damage to all enemy heroes in the area. The Caustic Finale slow, combined with that of an active Epicenter, will ensure that any enemy heroes caught within its radius will not easily escape.<br/><br/>An effective early-game combo for killing solo targets involves using Burrowstrike on an enemy so they end up facing away from you, and then immediately channeling Epicenter. If done correctly, the enemy will be unable to turn around to stun you out of the channel, and will almost certainly guarantee a kill. You should discontinue this around mid game, however, as you will need to save your ultimate for teamfight situations.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Gauntlets of Strength and Circlet give Sand King good attribute bonuses, particularly strength, which helps to alleviate his low base strength, giving him more survivability.<br/><br/>One each of Tangos and Healing Salve provide health regeneration to help you survive the laning stage.<br/><br/>At least one Clarity is recommended, since Sand King's mana pool is quite small. Even with stat items, he can only cast Burrowstrike twice before running completely out of mana. Being able to cast Burrowstrike multiple times in-lane allows Sand King to be a very aggressive support that increases his team's chances of getting First Blood.<br/><br/>As a utility support, Sand King should buy early support items such as the Animal Courier and Observer Wards.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is useful on all support heroes, Sand King included. A full-charge Magic Stick allows him to replenish a large fraction of his HP and mana, the mana giving him enough instant burst regen to cast Burrowstrike one more time to escape or ensure a kill.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed give Sand King the mobility he needs to catch up to enemies and cast Burrowstrike on them. Because Sand King's spells are so reliant on positioning, getting Boots as early as possible can enable him to be more active on the map.<br/><br/>Bracer provides great all around attributes, especially to Sand King's strength to give him more HP and base damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Magic Wand gives Sand King more attributes and the ability to store more charges. The burst mana regen is particularly important since Sand King's mana pool is quite small throughout all stages of the game, so having the mana to cast his spells is extremely important.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots are built on Sand King both to increase the size of his own mana pool and to allow him to replenish his own and his teammates' mana, a crucial duty for a support. As Epicenter requires copious amounts of mana, Sand King must bolster his mana pool if he is to be able to initiate properly with his ultimate.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger should be the first core item that Sand King builds, as it greatly extends his reach and mobility, allowing him to initiate with Burrowstrike or Epicenter. Particularly, combined with Burrowstrike, Sand King can instantly jump on and disable an enemy from up to 2000 range away.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to carry on all heroes. For Sand King, being able to show up to any engagement and add Blink-Burrowstrike to the mix can be a very powerful asset to have.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly increases Sand King's initiation range and significantly augments the lethality of Epicenter. The longer-ranged Burrowstrike allows Sand King to catch significantly more targets with the stun from farther away, especially when combined with Blink Dagger, and applying Caustic Finale to all struck enemy heroes deals significantly more nuke damage without requiring Sand King to attack them. The item also improves Sand King's overall stats, particularly his HP and mana to give him more survivability during an initiation.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a very strong utility item on Sand King, as he can cast it immediately before blinking in with a Burrowstrike-Epicenter-Sandstorm combo.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a good mid-game item that gives Sand King survivability. The intelligence bonus shores up his mana pool, while the armor and active can give Sand King more survivability in teamfights if the enemy chooses to focus him.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Sand King immense survivability against physical damage, as well as another slow and damage nuke. Using the active alongside Epicenter can drastically slow enemies down, keeping them inside the radius of the ultimate.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can allow Sand King to channel his ultimate without worry of being interrupted by most enemy spells. It can be a handy item to have if you can't rely on making clean initiations, or need to do more in a teamfight without being disabled.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque greatly increases the size of Sand King's health pool, allowing him to do more in teamfights before falling.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape, while costly in terms of mana, is a very strong initiation and utility item that can improve Sand King's reach. The improved attack speed aids with utilizing Caustic Finale, while the magic resistance improves his survivability against magic nukes. The active, cast on himself, allows Sand King to stealthily approach targets in order to initiate with Blink-Burrowstrike, or allow an ally with initiation spells to do the same; if needed, it can also aid in channeling Epicenter by providing invisibility. It can also be used defensively, giving caught allies an escape window if the enemy has no ready detection.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards are extremely useful on Sand King, as he is a very strong de-warder despite being a melee hero. Possession of both Blink Dagger and Burrowstrike allows him to blink onto high-ground ward spots, place a Sentry Ward and destroy any Observer Wards he finds, and then Burrowstrike back down to safety.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom can be a useful utility item that aids Sand King in chasing enemies. Combined with Caustic Finale, Sand King can greatly slow enemies' movement speed.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good utility item, as Sand King has quite low base strength and can benefit from the mana regen. As he is already a very strong ganker, Sand King can easily get the charges he needs for the active, which allows him to heal himself or teammates, or add more damage to any ganks he participates in.<br/><br/>Force Staff is extremely strong on Sand King, as it allows him to displace himself even more on top of Blink Dagger and Burrowstrike. It can extend his initiating range to 2600 (3250 with Aghanim's Scepter), or allow him to displace allies and/or enemies in engagements. As well, it provides him with intelligence, giving him a bigger mana pool and gives him a small amount of HP regen as well.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity can be a very strong utility item to build on Sand King. It increases his base movement speed, granting him even more mobility, and gives him more mana and mana regen, allowing him to effectively ignore his mana requirements. The active ability can be used on enemies as an extra disable, or on Sand King himself for temporary invulnerability, such as immediately after a successful Epicenter combo.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a good utility item to build. It increases Sand King's resistance to magical nukes, useful due to the manner in which he initiates with Epicenter, and the active can shield himself and teammates from magical damage for a time.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard can be a useful durability and utility item to purchase on Sand King. As he already has survivability issues due to his low armor and mediocre strength, buffing up his physical survivability can allow him to do more in fights, particularly as he is a melee hero who can take full advantage of the damage block, and the active gives all of his teammates immense resistance to physical damage.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very expensive item to build, but gives Sand King many strong benefits. It gives him stats across the board and a self-sustaining mana pool, and the active gives him yet another instant hard-disable that he can use on the enemy.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Slardar is a physical damage-based carry who specializes in chasing down and crushing his foes. While he is very straightforward and easy to learn, mastering his abilities can allow players to unlock his true potential.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High Physical Damage<br/><br/>Powerful Carry potential<br/><br/>High Armor and fast attack speed<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Sluggish Mobility<br/><br/>Quite item dependent<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Bash of the Deep average stats (hero)<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Guardian Sprint</h4>Guardian Sprint is a costless spell that greatly increases Slardar's movement speed, at the cost of increased damage taken from incoming attacks.<br/><br/>As a mobility spell, Guardian Sprint is a good spell to max out early in a match, as the increased movement speed can allow Slardar to more easily chase down enemies or escape ganks, important for increasing his gold gain or preventing gold loss in the early game.<br/><br/>Guardian Sprint is primarily used to close the distance to a foe in order to land a successful Slithereen Crush, particularly in the early game if an enemy is caught out of position. It is also a strong mobility spell that allows Slardar to quickly traverse between lanes or reach a combat area faster, and can save him time and mana due to negating the need to use a Town Portal Scroll.<br/><br/>Because it provides phased movement while it is active, Guardian Sprint allows Slardar to ignore unit collision while pursuing or fleeing enemies. When chasing foes, this allows Slardar to simply run through impeding creeps, as well as the target itself, to get ahead to stun them with Slithereen Crush. When fleeing, Slardar can run straight through creep waves, forcing enemies to path around and possibly lose him.<br/><br/>With its low cooldown and high active duration, Slardar is able to use Guardian Sprint to be very active on the map, as it has a 5 second downtime at all levels.<br/><br/>Be mindful of the increased damage taken while Guardian Sprint is active, as casting it at the wrong time can leave Slardar open to enemy attacks, particularly if he is hard-disabled and is unable to easily escape the enemy. It can sometimes be smarter to pursue an enemy without Guardian Sprint, and reserve it for clearing the area.<br/><br/>In the most optimal case, try to cast Guardian Sprint as early as possible when pursuing foes. By using the bonus movement speed to close the distance early on, Slardar can reach the target faster and allow the buff to expire sooner, giving the enemy no window to take advantage of the increased damage taken. When escaping, try to use your judgment, as casting Guardian Sprint too early can allow the enemy to hit you with a ranged nuke for increased damage before you can escape, while casting it too late can allow the enemy to catch up and disable Slardar, preventing him from escaping at all.<br/><h4>Slithereen Crush</h4>Slithereen Crush is a basic disable that stuns all enemies in an area around Slardar, dealing physical damage and slowing them for a short time at the end of the stun.<br/><br/>Because its damage and stun duration both increase with level, Slithereen Crush should be Slardar's first skill that he maxes out. Increasing its damage and stun duration gives Slardar and his allies increased chance of securing early kills if he is able to land the stun on an enemy.<br/><br/>In order to reliably stun enemies with Slithereen Crush, a Blink Dagger is absolutely crucial. Given good timing and opportunity, Slardar can stun multiple enemies with a single cast, making him a strong team initiator.<br/><br/>With an 8 second cooldown at all levels, Slithereen Crush can allow Slardar to repeatedly lock down enemies as he chases them, especially when combined with Guardian Sprint. Combined with Corrosive Haze and a Blink Dagger, this makes Slardar extremely difficult to escape.<br/><br/>Slithereen Crush is easily Slardar's most expensive spell, so always be sure to cast it carefully. Missing Slithereen Crush can not only result in a missed kill but will also cost Slardar another opportunity at a future kill if he does not have mana replenishment handy. Always make sure to treads switch to intelligence when casting it, in order to reduce the strain that it puts on Slardar's mana pool.<br/><br/>Remember that after the stun, enemies will have their attack and movement speed slowed for a short time. This can render enemies unable to easily fight back or flee, as the movement speed reduction can allow Slardar to more easily body-block their movements, provided that Guardian Sprint is not active.<br/><h4>Bash of the Deep</h4>Bash of the Deep gives Slardar a chance to stun enemies with each attack, dealing bonus physical damage in the process.<br/><br/>Because Bash of the Deep's effectiveness is determined primarily by Slardar's attack speed, it is a poor ability to put skill points into in the early game. Leave it unleveled until both Guardian Sprint and Slithereen Crush are maxed out, as even a value point can foul last-hits.<br/><br/>As it is chance-based per attack, Slardar should focus on building attack speed items for the late game in order to make the most of Bash of the Deep. As his attacks can stun through spell immunity, improving his chances of proccing Bash of the Deep can greatly increase Slardar's lethality against even enemy carries.<br/><h4>Corrosive Haze</h4>Corrosive Haze debuffs the target enemy's armor, greatly reducing their resistance to all sources of physical damage.<br/><br/>Corrosive Haze is an extremely strong single-target debuff, capable of rendering even the toughest hard carry unable to withstand attacks from Slardar and his team. As well, it is the linchpin that amplifies the strength of all of Slardar's spells, as both Slithereen Crush and Bash of the Deep deal physical damage.<br/><br/>Because of its spammability, Corrosive Haze can be repeatedly cast before or during a teamfight in order to break multiple enemies' armor. This will soften them up not only for Slardar's attacks, but those of his teammates as well, especially allied carries with high physical damage output.<br/><br/>Remember that Corrosive Haze will provide True Sight over its target, which allows Slardar and his team to see in an area around the enemy and even track them through invisibility. This can allow Slardar to easily pursue and crush enemies that he has cast his ultimate on, even mobile heroes with escape abilities like Bounty Hunter, Riki, Queen of Pain and Puck. Casting Guardian Sprint to chase after enemies, using his own Blink Dagger to traverse impassible terrain, and stopping them in their tracks with Slithereen Crush is what Slardar is best known for once he has gained vision over them with his ultimate.<br/><br/>Beware, even though Corrosive Haze has a very low mana cost, repeated casting can still drain Slardar's mana very quickly. If time permits, treads switching between casts can allow Slardar to have more mana available for future engagements when he may need to cast multiple instances of Slithereen Crush.<br/><br/>Due to its extremely low cooldown, Corrosive Haze can be used as a farming spell to allow Slardar to more easily kill larger jungle creeps. As well, it can be cast on Roshan when taking the Aegis, greatly reducing the time required to kill him, and is a good way to break Linken's Sphere on enemies prior to engagement.<br/><br/>While it is an easily dispellable debuff, Corrosive Haze can be cast on spell immune enemies. Combined with Bash of the Deep, Slardar can be a powerful threat even against enemies with Black King Bar.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Stout Shield helps to mitigate harass damage taken by ranged lane opponents, extending Slardar's survivability in-lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve and Tangoes provide basic health regeneration to prevent being harassed out of lane.<br/><br/>Clarity gives Slardar a way to replenish his mana pool from casting Slithereen Crush. Being able to cast his stun more than twice in-lane gives him more opportunities to get kills against lane opponents, and thus more opportunities at gold and experience.<br/><br/>Iron Branch provides a small boost to Slardar's attributes and can be used to make a Magic Wand later on.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Magic Stick gives cheap burst healing and mana, which can give Slardar more survivability or enough mana to cast Slithereen Crush one more time to secure a kill.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are absolutely crucial early on for any hero. In Slardar's case, it greatly improves the potency of Guardian Sprint, allowing him to more easily catch up to fleeing enemies or escape pursuers.<br/><br/>Helm of Iron Will provides good sustain in lane and the extra armor makes you very survivable against physical damage in the early game. It builds directly into an Armlet of Mordiggian.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand provides a cheap boost to Slardar's attributes and a quick burst heal. Use it to survive that last bit of damage or cast one last spell in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Power Treads is the best boot choice for Slardar, as attribute switching can give Slardar more strength for HP and base damage or more intelligence to reduce the mana cost of his spells. The attack speed improves his chances of proccing Bash of the Deep.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is very cheap and gives Slardar many powerful bonuses. Improving his attack speed, armor and damage makes him a much stronger fighter, while the HP regen keeps him topped up. The active gives him extra strength and damage, making him much tankier and making his attacks hit harder.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Black King Bar allows Slardar to ignore enemy crowd control spells, greatly improving his ability to kill important targets in teamfights. It also provides bonus strength for more HP, and increased physical damage output.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is extremely powerful in Slardar's hands, as he can instantly get within range to cast Slithereen Crush. It should be considered a core item in all circumstances, and rushed if possible.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade is a strong initiating item that improves Slardar's physical DPS and allows him to roam invisibly for targets. Combining Guardian Sprint and Shadow Walk can allow Slardar to move at maximum movement speed while invisible, and allows him to deal backstab damage when attacking out of invisibility.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is the best survivability item in the game. Its raw HP and passive regeneration ability allows Slardar to stay in teamfights longer and recover from them faster.<br/><br/>Desolator is a relatively cheap item that provides increased bonus damage. Its Unique Attack Modifier can reduce enemies' armor and synergizes with Corrosive Haze, allowing Slardar to shred enemies with his attacks.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass improves Slardar's armor and attack speed, making him tankier and increasing his proc chance with Bash of the Deep. The aura gives allies more armor and attack speed as well, and the enemy armor reduction further reduces their physical damage resistance on top of Corrosive Haze.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard provides Slardar with increased health, damage block and armor, drastically improving his tankiness and allowing him to shrug off most forms of physical damage. The active ability allows him to grant damage block and armor to all nearby teammates for a short time, increasing their survivability as well as his own.<br/><br/>Moon Shard greatly increases Slardar's attack speed, improving his physical damage output and a greater chance to proc his Bash of the Deep. The Shade Sight passive also improves his night vision, allowing him to more easily spot targets while hunting in the darkness.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb gives Slardar a way to counter enemy target spells, allowing him to disable enemy supports or discourage them from focusing him. It also provides armor for tankiness, and HP and mana regen to allow him to roam independently.<br/><br/>Bottle can be a good purchase on a roaming Slardar, as he can pick up runes while hunting for targets (both to refill the bottle and to utilize the runes for ganks). Slardar's small mana pool and damage vulnerability from Guardian Sprint means that he benefits from a source of HP and mana replenishment, particularly since he can treads switch to get more value out of it.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows can be a useful early roaming item if Slardar intends to be very active in the early game. It provides strength for more HP and base damage, making him tankier and letting him hit harder, and provides a small amount of mana regen to help replenish his mana pool. As he can easily get charges from successful ganks, they can be used to heal Slardar after successful kills, particularly as he takes increased damage during Guardian Sprint, and can add damage to future ganks.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance provides Slardar with an array of useful bonuses. The all-around attributes give Slardar more HP and mana, the latter of which is extremely helpful for allowing him to cast his spells, and the aura provides movement and attack speed bonuses, both of which greatly help Slardar in combat. In particular, the movement speed aura can combine with Guardian Sprint to allow Slardar to reach the movement speed cap of 550.<br/><br/>Vanguard is a useful mid-game item that greatly increases Slardar's beefiness. The damage block and HP bonus help to reduce Slardar's vulnerability during Guardian Sprint, and the item can be upgraded into a Crimson Guard later for increased utility.<br/><br/>Blade Mail gives Slardar many strong mid-game benefits that can fill in some of his deficiencies. The bonus intelligence helps him to cast his spells more easily, while the armor and damage make him a better fighter. The active lets Slardar use his HP offensively during ganks, and discourages enemies from targeting him in teamfights.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is an unorthodox utility item that can help Slardar to stay in the game if his late-game item progression is being stunted by enemy aggression. It provides Slardar with armor for survivability and mana regen for sustaining his small mana pool, while the lifesteal allows him to maintain his HP pool from any damage he incurs due to Guardian Sprint. The damage bonus also allows him and his team to hit harder, allowing them to better utilize Corrosive Haze.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha allows Slardar to fight earlier, as it has an easy buildup and provides many useful bonuses. It gives Slardar increased HP, armor, damage and attack speed, along with improved movement speed that allows him to pursue enemies without resorting to Guardian Sprint. The Greater Maim can work alongside Bash of the Deep to greatly increase the lethality of Slardar's attacks, making him a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Silver Edge can be upgraded from Shadow Blade, and greatly increases Slardar's ganking prowess. The Shadow Walk backstab damage is increased, and the Break can disable enemy passives that may be preventing Slardar from easily killing certain enemies. It also reduces the damage output of the hit enemy, and provides a nice boost to Slardar's stats.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar greatly increases Slardar's physical damage, and prevents him from missing attacks due to evasion or blind, which can be important against certain enemies. The Mini-Bash attack modifier also stacks alongside Slardar's own Bash of the Deep to increase his damage output.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives Slardar stats across the board, making him much tankier and alleviating his mana issues. The Unique Attack Modifier lets Slardar slow enemies with his attacks, further reducing their ability to escape him.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is a useful attack speed utility item that greatly increases Slardar's chances to proc his Bash of the Deep; as well, the Chain Lightning modifier allows him to deal magic damage around him with his attacks, giving him creep wave clearing capability and augmenting his damage output if he manages to land Slithereen Crush on multiple enemy heroes. Static Charge can further increase his damage output, discouraging enemies from focusing him for fear of proccing the discharge.<br/><br/>Satanic can greatly increase Slardar's survivability through a combination of factors. It provides high strength, making Slardar much tankier, and bonus damage to further give him more damage output. The lifesteal allows Slardar to maintain his HP, even in the midst of battle, as he can cast Corrosive Haze to increase the amount of damage dealt (and thus the amount he regenerates through lifesteal), and he can use the active to fully recover his HP in just a few attacks as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Spirit Breaker usually serve as an initiator/ganker/tanker role in the team. His skillset allows/requires player to consistently checking for any ganking opportunity across the map meanwhile helping his team secure space and farm. If he does so, a successful early-mid game Barathrum can snowball into a semi-carry and crush his foes relentlessly, carving a path to victory for his team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great ganker thanks to global initiation and durability<br/><br/>Can stunlock a target for a long period of time<br/><br/>Can solo-kill fragile heroes after charging at them from anywhere<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very poor teamfight contribution<br/><br/>Unreliable Bash, mainly due to slow attack speed<br/><br/>Heavily countered by decent vision on the map and sticking together<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Greater Bash average stats<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Charge of Darkness</h4>Use Charge of Darkness to get close, stun your target, and make him vulnerable to your attacks.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can be used without interrupting your charge, activate it just when you get close to the enemy to take advantage of its duration during the fight.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can also be activated while charging, greatly increasing the surprise factor of his charge and preventing easy charge interruption such as Telekinesis. In addition, the Shadow Blade bonus damage will be applied to the first attack from invisibility.<br/><br/>Charge of Darkness allows Spirit Breaker to run through units, trees, structures and terrain. It does not indicate your enemies when targeted either, letting you setup ganks.<br/><br/>Although Charge of Darkness is typically used to get into fights, it can also be used to get back out in a pinch; by targeting a creep in a different lane Spirit Breaker can move quickly to avoid death, then cancel the charge when he is out of danger.<br/><br/>While it does not provide True Sight the indicator will follow the invisible unit being charged and the Charge will still hit an enemy that has gone invisible after being charged. This will cause the ability to interrupt channeling spells being performed by invisible heroes such as Sand King's Sand Storm.<br/><br/>During teamfights you can spam charge of darkness in order to create chaos and disrupt your oponent's formation, try to target the backliners in order to get the most stuns possible.<br/><h4>Empowering Haste</h4>Empowering Haste active spell increases your move speed, making it handy for reaching the front lines quickly or for quick escapes (for example after charging into enemy territory).<br/><br/>The move speed increase also synergizes with your passive, potentially increasing your damage output for a short time. Consider using it in order to quickly dispose of lone enemy heroes before they acquire backup.<br/><h4>Greater Bash</h4>Greater Bash deals more damage depending on Barathrum's movement speed. Getting items that increase movement speed, such as Sange and Yasha and Drum of Endurance, will greatly improve your damage.<br/><br/>Always try to angle Spirit Breaker in a way that you may push your enemy away from safety, the chances that you will get multiple bashes are slim but should still be considered.<br/><h4>Nether Strike</h4>Nether Strike deals major damage to the target enemy and teleports behind them, wherever they go. You can use this to catch blinking or teleporting enemies before they get away.<br/><br/>Sometimes it might be a good idea to use Nether Strike on a magic immune hero to interrupt their actions as the greater bash will hit them regardless. Situations where for example your team gets caught in a Black Hole by a magic immune Enigma you can turn the tide of the fight if you can stop him right at the beginning.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Tangos and a Healing Salve help Spirit Breaker sustain during the laning phase, preventing him from returning to base due to enemy harassment.<br/><br/>Stout Shield will greatly reduce incoming damage from physical damage during the laning phase. This is most helpful when the lane has one or more ranged heroes harassing consistently.<br/><br/>Iron Branch is a cheap and effective way to improve Spirit Breaker's low mana pool, as well as his health pool.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are essential for Spirit Breaker, as the improved speed will allow him to escape deadly situations, as well as catching up to an escaping enemy. The bonus movement speed will also provide additional damage because of Greater Bash.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a useful burst health/mana item if the enemies in lane will be casting many spells. It can later be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a helpful item when roaming or ganking. Assuming a gank is successful, Spirit Breaker can use the Urn of Shadows to heal without returning to the fountain. The bonus mana regeneration also allows him the ability to use Charge of Darkness far more frequently.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads give additional attack speed, as well as durability and damage, all of which increase the effectiveness of Greater Bash.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is good for burst health/mana while providing a boost to his attributes compared to the Magic Stick.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness gives bonus attack speed and movement speed when activate, increasing both the damage and frequency of Greater Bash attacks.<br/><br/>Black King Bar makes you immune to many abilities that interrupt your Charge of Darkness, allowing you to engage and damage your target unimpeded.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter improves Nether Strike by greatly reducing its cooldown, as well as increasing its range. It also causes all nearby units to be hit by Greater Bash. This can be a good choice if your team needs a powerful initiation spell.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd will not only increase Spirit Breaker's durability from physical attacks because of the added evasion, its active ability can disarm enemy carries relying on physical damage.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian grants Spirit Breaker additional attack speed and damage output at the cost of his health every second. However, the life drain can mostly be countered by the lifesteal given by Mask of Madness, making it a useful purchase when used correctly.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass will give Spirit Breaker a large increase in attack speed, as well as providing an attack speed/armor aura to nearby allies. The extra attack speed will cause Greater Bash to occur more frequently.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar will grant a significant damage bonus on when the bash occurs. This synergizes well with the other attack speed items used to increase the frequency of Greater Bash.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance increases the movement speed and attack speed of both himself and his team. The bonus movement speed and attack speed synergize well with Greater Bash.<br/><br/>Moon Shard gives Spirit Breaker the largest single-item-slot increase in attack speed in the entire game, which causes Greater Bash to occur very frequently. Thus, it should be considered to keep it through the majority of the game until a more effective item can be purchased, at which point the Shard can be consumed and replaced - The attack speed bonus will be halved, but having a permanent 60 attack speed bonus without needing an inventory slot for it is extremely useful.<br/><br/>Silver Edge grants you invisibility which could be useful for escape or to further increase your ganking/roaming capabilities. Attacking to break invisibility will disable enemy passives, reduce their damage, and give you a powerful 225 strike. It also grants a decent amount of attack speed, attack damage and attribute bonuses, it can also be used during charge before hitting your target in order to avoid getting disabled and thus avoiding breaking your charge.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape also gives you invisibility while also making you much more magic resistant during the invisibility, making escapes significantly easier, and can be activated before using Nether Strike to avoid being interrupted without needing a Black King Bar. It also gives him natural Magical resistance, making him a stronger tank.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb gives you good survivability stats and mana regen to allow you to use Charge of Darkness with little need to ever return to base for more mana. Its active will also make your initiation abilities stronger as spellcasters will need to think twice before attacking to nuke you or shut you down.<br/><br/>Dust of Appearance should be carried against invisible heroes and heroes that tend to build into Shadow Blade such as Slark or Shadow Fiend. Not carrying dust allows such enemies to easily escape your ganks. However, Charge of Darkness will outline an enemy even when they are invisible, so allies can still chase and utilise AoE abilities even without detection.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sven is the embodiment of strength, a mighty front line fighter capable of dealing tremendous physical damage to groups of foes at once. A well farmed Sven can destroy an enemy in just a few hits, overpowering other carries with sheer burst damage. However, Sven is vulnerable to kiting and disables, and generally has a slower attack speed than most carries.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high melee damage.<br/><br/>Good at clearing groups.<br/><br/>Reliable AoE stun.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>Low attack speed.<br/><br/>Highly dependent on Black King Bar.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Ranged heroes can easily harass Sven in lane. Make sure he is paired with a support hero.<br/><br/>Sven is very easy to shut down with good crowd control. Therefore, Sven players need to know exactly when to use their Black King Bar, and when to conserve the charge.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Storm Hammer</h4>Storm Hammer is one of the best stuns in the game, with a large AoE radius to catch several enemies at once.<br/><br/>Each point in Storm Hammer increases the ability's damage by 75 points of damage. It may be more efficient to spend your skill points into other abilities first if you are not in need of the damage increase early in the game.<br/><br/>Storm Hammer should be used judiciously, as Sven has very low natural mana.<br/><br/>Storm Hammer has a very bright and visible effect, and can be disjointed.<br/><br/>Despite its cast range, it may be useful to conserve Storm Hammer until Sven is relatively close or uses Blink Dagger. This ensures that enemies do not spread apart during the projectile's travel time, and maximizes Sven's time to land hits on the target.<br/><h4>Great Cleave</h4>Sometimes it may be wise to avoid leveling Great Cleave early on, as it will greatly push the lane towards the enemy tower, thus making farming more difficult.<br/>Later in the game, points in Great Cleave is what will allow Sven to farm quickly.<br/><br/><br/>With enough points in Great Cleave, stacking neutral camps is a viable farming strategy for Sven, as he can clear them fairly easily with most of his skills and gain a gold advantage.<br/><br/>Great Cleave grants Sven a surprisingly long reach for a melee hero. It is possible for you to indirectly harass your opponents through the splash damage.<br/><br/>Take note that the splash damage from Great Cleave is not reduced by armor values. As such, try to target enemies with low armor as it will greatly increase the damage taken by any surrounding opponents.<br/><h4>Warcry</h4>While Warcry should always be used before an engagement, its extra speed and armor can also be used to disengage from a losing fight.<br/><br/>Warcry's armor allows Sven to skip Assault Cuirass sometimes for more aggressive items like Moon Shard.<br/><br/>A high level Warcry allows Sven and his allies to tank physical damage abilities such as Omnislash and Quill Spray.<br/><br/>Warcry's buff is purgeable, so beware of enemy purge skills and Diffusal Blade.<br/><h4>God's Strength</h4>God's Strength is the ability that lets a farmed Sven kill heroes in two or three hits.<br/><br/>God's Strength lasts 25 seconds with only 80 seconds of cooldown, meaning that it can be used outside of teamfights.<br/>Stacked Ancient creeps are ideal to use God's Strength on.<br/><br/>Use it to quickly take down a tower or barracks and gain a map advantage.<br/><br/><br/>Because of its long duration, don't hesitate to use it "too early" before a fight. Being jumped without God's Strength active is a huge waste of Sven's potential.<br/><br/>God's Strength benefit from items that increase Sven's strength like Heart of Tarrasque, not items that increase raw damage.<br/>Critical Strike from Daedalus still increases the damage a lot.<br/><br/><br/>Coupled with any item source of lifesteal, hits while God's Strength is active can replenish Sven's health very quickly.<br/><br/>Be aware of your opponents' movespeed, abilitiesand inventory when you activate God's Strength, as most heroes will likely kite Sven while he is under the effects of God's Strength.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Iron Branch gives Sven much needed stats, also additional regeneration combined with Tango.<br/><br/>Tangos are needed for early health regeneration.<br/><br/>Healing Salve gives rapid health regeneration, at a higher cost.<br/><br/>Stout Shield helps Sven deal with harassment in lane.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango gives burst mana replenish which allows for an additional Storm Hammer in a pinch.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade can be picked up to help Sven last hit more efficiently.<br/><br/>Clarity potions can be useful due to Sven's small mana pool and large mana cost on Storm Hammer, and is more likely bought by a supportive Sven.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Poor Man's Shield is a upgrade from Stout Shield and help Sven tank harassment in forms of attack.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed increases Sven's moderate movement speed, allows him to attack a few more times while chasing and escape.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a good choice when faced with heavy lane harassment in forms of skills.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is sometimes bought so that Sven can use Storm Hammer more frequently.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a good choice to consolidate Magic Stick's functionality and the minor attribute boosts when starting with Iron Branches.<br/><br/>Power Treads synergize well with Sven's build due to the bonuses in attack speed and its requirement of Belt of Strength.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is the most important core item for Sven. It is his only defense against disables, and provides a good boost to Sven's strength and damage. However sometimes the item could be purchased later since it does not increase your farm speed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Drum of Endurance will enable Sven to quickly get into combat and survive teamfights. It can be bought if Sven's early game does not go well enough to afford bigger items.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness compensates for his low attack and move speed. With lifesteal, Sven can recover his health with just a few hits on the enemy.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is a good early teamfight item as it provides overall growth in damage and attack speed as well as additional health and armor while active. Its active could be switched twice in quick succession in a pinch to gain additional health.<br/><br/>Echo Sabre essentially acts as a crit, allowing Sven's burst to increase significantly for a cheap price. Additionally, this second attack works identically to his regular attacks, meaning, if used while possessing a Daedalus, gives Sven twice the chance to crit.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator is an alternative to Mask of Madness, providing more armor than speed, and also allowing Sven to dominate a creep and use them to stack camps with it, allowing him to farm quickly thanks to his cleave.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger greatly improves Sven's mobility, allowing him to initiate teamfights as well as gank unsuspecting enemies, which can make a big difference in game outcomes.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is a worthwhile pick up for the mid game, especially because Sven can obtain it quickly - The attack speed, movement speed and added damage (partially added through strength) are all things Sven needs while the maim makes it harder for enemies to kite him.<br/><br/>Daedalus is the attack damage item Sven needs, as it gives Sven the critical chance that allows him to destroy enemies in just a few hits.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar provides less damage compared to Daedalus. However, True Strike counters Evasion, and the Mini-bash part allows Sven to chase and manfight better.<br/><br/>Moon Shard grants a huge boost in attack speed. Though largely lacking in utility and thus exceeded in usefulness by several other choices, a Moon Shard is a powerful luxury item that ensures Sven's continued dominance in a winning game. As Moon Shard can be consumed to permanently add attack speed, it does not need to take up a useful item slot that most other lategame items do.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass can be considered in the late game, as the negative armor debuff, attack speed and massive armor gain allow for Sven to truly become a tank.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque not only provides Sven with much better survivability, it also gives a lot strength bonus, which greatly increases the damage from God's Strength.<br/><br/>Satanic provides Sven with a good amount of survivability and damage. The active synergizes well with Sven's large DPS, ensuring that he will be able to get back into full health should he be allowed to continue attacking.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb gives Sven twice the time of Satanic, also double Storm Hammer in quick succession. The biggest contribute it provides is the 10 second Black King Bar in late game when Sven may be kited due to the spell immunity time loss. It also gives additional time for God's Strength to reactivate so that Sven can bring down towers after teamfight or reactivate after buyback. Beware of Sven's small mana pool since Refresh active costs a lot of mana.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade, while providing very little natural damage by itself, does provide an additional form of lockdown, granting Sven a minimum of 4 seconds of lockdown coupled with Storm Hammer (and without counting any additional bashes you get), which is more than enough to secure a kill on any enemy who doesn't have anyone to help them around. It also makes Sven much more difficult, if not near impossible to manfight as Sven's already overwhelming damage becomes all the more terrifying by the fact that he can outright stop an enemy from attacking through magic immunity. Finally, Sven is also one of the better users of this item in terms of damage due to the fact that it also provides strength, further increasing his damage during his ultimate. It also comes from Vanguard, making him nearly impervious to damage from most jungle creeps and most summons, though this feature is largely useless to a hero like Sven.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is a natural pickup in late game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tidehunter is a very durable hero who brings disables and debuffs to the field. He focuses on debilitating the enemy and shrugging off their attempts to disable and kill him, as he is capable of absorbing a tremendous amount of punishment should the enemy attempt to focus him down to prevent him from inhibiting them in teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>(One of) the best team fight ultimate in the game.<br/><br/>His durability gives you a chance to survive your own mistakes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Not a huge damage output.<br/><br/>Quite mana-dependent in the early game.<br/><br/>Kraken Shell doesn't purge everything.<br/><br/>Better opponents will know when they've got an actual shot at killing you.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of his innate toughness and strong array of debuffs, Tidehunter generally benefits from building mobility items that aid him in initiating with his ultimate (particularly a Blink Dagger), as well as items that improve his ability to cast his spells. Tidehunter's poor intelligence means that he must increase the size of his mana pool if he is to sustain his ability to cast his disables and debuffs.<br/><br/>Tidehunter can be played as an initiator or a tank, or some combination in between.<br/>Due to the immense disable potential of Ravage, getting a Blink Dagger allows Tidehunter to initiate fights by stunning the entire team for a long duration. After getting off a successful Ravage, he can follow up with Anchor Smash while the enemy is still disabled, reducing their ability to attack effectively, and then Gush to slow any stragglers, preventing them from easily escaping.<br/><br/>While he possesses strong initiating power with Ravage, Tidehunter can also discourage enemies from engaging by standing at the front lines and debilitating their ability to fight. Should the enemy choose to engage him, he can greatly reduce their base damage with Anchor Smash while also shrugging off their attacks and debuffs with Kraken Shell, and threaten them with a Ravage should they all jump on him.<br/><br/><br/>Tidehunter's flexibility allows him to be played either as a safe-lane support or solo off-laner. His skill and item build differs drastically depending on which path is taken.<br/>Played as a support, Tidehunter should focus on purchasing support items and harassing the enemy's off-laner. Generally he gets his Blink Dagger much later, if at all, due to not being given farm or experience priority. Anchor Smash can discourage the enemy from approaching lest they take damage and have their last-hitting power greatly reduced, and Gush can slow them for chain-disables and kills.<br/><br/>Played as an off-laner, Tidehunter should focus on surviving while also harassing the enemy's carry and supports. Kraken Shell allows Tidehunter to ignore the enemy's harass damage, while he can use Anchor Smash to harass the enemy down and prevent their carry from getting easy last-hits. Off-lane Tidehunter benefits greatly if the enemy's carry (and optionally supports as well) is also melee, as they must approach the creep wave to last-hit, making casting Anchor Smash much easier.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Gush</h4>Gush is a single-target magic nuke that slows its target and reduces their armor on top of the damage.<br/><br/>Gush is a powerful early-game disable, as it slows the target's movement speed by 40% for 4 seconds. During ganks, this can often be enough to slow an enemy enough to catch them with additional disables. As such, no matter what lane Tidehunter is placed in, at least one early point in Gush is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Gush also reduces the target's armor, increasing their vulnerability to not only right-clicks but Anchor Smash as well, since it deals physical damage. Keep this in mind when casting Gush, as it can be used not only as a disable but as an armor debuff to help your carries deal more right-click damage.<br/><br/>When upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, Gush becomes an area-targeted spell that allows it to affect multiple enemies in an area rather than just a single enemy, as well as drastically reducing its cooldown to give it a 57% uptime.<br/>The area-of-effect upgrade makes Gush extremely powerful for killing creep waves and neutral camps, particularly as the armor reduction softens them up for a follow-up Anchor Smash. This can allow Tidehunter to farm more easily on his down-time, and push lanes by himself.<br/><br/>With its wide area and long travel length, Gush can be used to slow enemies at a distance, allowing Tidehunter and his team to chase them down more easily. It also prevents enemies from evading the spell by juking through trees, as simply casting Gush in their general direction should most often hit them and inflict them with the slow and armor debuff. Used judiciously, it can even be used to put enemy Blink Daggers on cooldown from range prior to initiations.<br/><br/>An upgraded Gush can be a powerful spell to cast following a successful Ravage. Inflicting multiple enemies with the slow and armor debuff can greatly soften them up for teammates, and the greatly reduced cooldown allows Tidehunter to continuously use it to slow them down as they try to escape after a Ravage.<br/><br/>Be mindful that purchasing Aghanim's Scepter prevents enemies from blocking it with Linken's Sphere. While this also prevents the ability from being used to deliberately break Linken's Sphere ahead of a stronger single-target disable, Tidehunter can instead use it to land the slow on the enemy, increasing the window with which teammates have to land further disables.<br/><br/><h4>Kraken Shell</h4>Kraken Shell provides Tidehunter with damage block, as well as removing most debuffs from him once he takes a certain amount of damage.<br/><br/>Kraken Shell is a powerful form of damage block as it has a 100% proc chance. In the off-lane, it is recommended to get at least two early levels in the ability, as this equates to having a Poor Man's Shield that also works 100% of the time against tower and creep attacks.<br/><br/>After taking enough player damage, Kraken Shell applies a strong dispel on Tidehunter. This includes not only many powerful debuffs, but stuns as well, drastically increasing Tidehunter's survivability. As such, even in the late game Kraken Shell is a very powerful ability as it prevents Tidehunter from being chain-disabled or permanently silenced, ensuring that he is always ready to cast his spells when needed.<br/>Be mindful that not every debuff can be purged off. We think most commonly of Doom or Rupture.<br/><br/>You're especially vulnerable to spells that affect a zone for some time, like Smoke Screen or Static Storm.<br/><br/><br/>Kraken Shell's damage threshold decreases as it is leveled up. For this reason, building HP items on Tidehunter greatly increases its usefulness, as Tidehunter can reach the threshold multiple times the more HP he has.<br/><h4>Anchor Smash</h4>Anchor Smash is an area physical damage nuke that inflicts enemies with an attack damage debuff.<br/><br/>Anchor Smash is a great way to clear creeps and farm for Tidehunter. Due to its low Mana cost, it can be used to harass enemies, especially melee heroes.<br/><br/>Anchor Smash's cooldown decreases as it is leveled, and matches the debuff duration at level 2 or higher. Used properly, Tidehunter can keep at least one enemy's attack damage permanently crippled so long as he remains within range of them.<br/><br/>Do not underestimate the 60% damage reduction from Anchor Smash at level 4. If you use it on a hero with powerful basic attacks, such as Ursa, their damage output gets severely reduced.<br/><br/>With enough levels in Anchor Smash and Kraken Shell, Tidehunter can farm ancient creeps fairly reliably, especially if they have been stacked by you or your teammates a few times. Anchor Smash deals physical area-of-effect damage that hits all the creeps simultaneously while also reducing their attack damage, and the damage block from Kraken Shell further reduces any damage that they are able to do, often to zero. This can be useful for giving Tidehunter levels and farm for items at any point in the game, whether it is to help him recover from a bad laning phase or to supplement his gold and experience gain.<br/><h4>Ravage</h4>Ravage is an area nuke that damages and stuns all enemies in an extremely wide radius.<br/><br/>Ravage is your most powerful teamfight ability, as its wide effect radius and long stun duration can completely stop the entire enemy team in their tracks. Use it to initiate or counter-initiate teamfights, but beware its extremely long cooldown, and do not be afraid to hold onto it if you do not think it can drastically benefit your team, even if it means your death.<br/><br/>Remember that while Ravage travels quickly, it does take a brief time to extend to its maximum range. Very alert opponents might be able to blink away or activate spell immunity before they are stunned, so be sure to blink in closer to those heroes to reduce their window of escape.<br/><br/>Should the enemy team have a Rubick, it is critically important to cast another one of your spells (generally Anchor Smash) after Ravage, as an ability so devastating could easily be the deciding factor in a teamfight should Rubick steal it.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are basic regen requirements no matter what lane Tidehunter is placed in. They give him HP sustain and ensure he cannot be forced out of the lane by enemy harass.<br/><br/>Clarity is useful for replenishing Tidehunter's small base mana pool, as Anchor Smash does not cost a lot of mana and Gush is a powerful disable that is handy to have available at all times.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength and Circlet are quite expensive, but can greatly improve Tidehunter's health pool and last-hitting power, both of which are very useful when playing in the off-lane. If playing as a safe-lane support though, such stats are not strictly needed and you should instead purchase support items such as the Animal Courier and Observer Wards, and cheaper stat items like Iron Branches.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is useful for giving Tidehunter a measure of burst regen in emergency situations. A full-charge Magic Stick can give enough mana to cast one more spell in the early game.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are critical for purchasing on Tidehunter whether in the safe- or off-lane. In the off-lane, more movement speed may be required to evade gank attempts, and in the safe-lane it may be needed to quickly position yourself to cast Gush during a gank.<br/><br/>Bracer gives Tidehunter more stats, particularly Strength, increasing his tankiness.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand gives Tidehunter more stats, as well as increased charge capacity. Given his small mana pool, a Magic Wand serves all the same purposes as a Magic Stick and can be useful to keep at all times.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots increases the size of Tidehunter's small mana pool, allowing him to cast his spells much more easily, and gives him the ability to replenish teammates' mana as well, an important duty for a support hero.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is possibly Tidehunter's most important core item, as it allows him to easily position himself to cast Ravage in a teamfight. It also allows him to chase enemies and cast Gush more easily, and can be used as an escape tool as well.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should always be carried, as Tidehunter's powerful disables can turn teamfights in his team's favor. As such, being able to show up to teamfights, ganks and counter-ganks at all times is very important.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is an expensive luxury item to farm, but can allow Tidehunter to stand in the middle of teamfights and absorb large amounts of damage, particularly due to Kraken Shell.<br/><br/>Radiance is a highly situational aura item that can be useful for tanking and chasing. Its burn damage and induced miss chance can force the enemy to engage you in teamfights, using their spells on you instead of teammates, and it can be a useful chasing tool as it allows Tidehunter to damage enemies without stopping to cast spells, as well as prevent any Blink Daggers from coming off cooldown.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Tidehunter a much larger mana pool, allowing him to cast spells much more frequently, and the armor and aura give him even more survivability against physical damage. Its active ability can be used after a successful Ravage, slowing the enemy's movement speed after the long stun duration.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is a highly unorthodox aura item to build on Tidehunter. The bonus armor makes him much tankier, while the aura allows him to grant allies with increased armor and attack speed. The enemy armor reduction stacks alongside that of Gush, particularly when upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, allowing Tidehunter to greatly reduce enemy armor.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a powerful tank and aura item, as it greatly reduces the amount of damage Tidehunter takes from magic nukes, thus greatly increasing the power of Kraken Shell. Its active ability also shields teammates from magic damage.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb can extend Ravage's duration by casting it twice, making it easier for allies to turn the tides of a teamfight. Make sure you have enough mana to pull it off, though.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is useful both as a stat and aura item, as it gives Tidehunter stats across the board, particularly Intelligence for his mana pool and movement speed for mobility. The aura, especially the active portion, can benefit your team when cast during a teamfight.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves is an expensive purchase, but greatly increases Tidehunter's survivability and gives him much more teamfight contribution. The active allows Tidehunter to purge debuffs off of himself if the enemy simply place low-damage disables on him to avoid proccing Kraken Shell, and the HP and mana restore are tremendous boons for pushes and teamfights. As well, the aura can provide tremendous amounts of armor and HP regen to teammates who are low.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a flexible initiation and utility item, as the invisibility and magical resistance can be used either to allow Tidehunter to initiate with Ravage without the need for Blink Dagger, or can save a teammate who is caught out of position and is being focused down by enemies. However, mind its mana cost, as the active costs more than most of Tidehunter's spells.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly improves the potency of Gush, allowing Tidehunter to inflict multiple enemies with the nuke and debuff at high frequency. It also increases his HP and mana, making him tankier and improving his ability to utilize Gush more frequently.<br/><br/><br/>When played as a safe-lane support, it is important to purchase the Animal Courier and/or Observer Wards for your team. Your free inventory space should be filled with Iron Branches for cheap stats, and you should upgrade to the Flying Courier when possible.<br/>Orb of Venom is a useful utility disable item that increases Tidehunter's ability to hunt down enemies. Combined with Gush, Tidehunter can lower a single enemy's movement speed by 54%, allowing teammates to easily get within range to land further disables.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a highly flexible item that greatly enhances Tidehunter's survivability while also giving him a measure of mana regen. The increased armor can drastically increase Tidehunter's beefiness as he can shrug off physical damage even more effectively, and the active can either stack with Gush's armor reduction or grant bonus armor to an allied hero. These bonuses can be amplified further by upgrading the item into a Solar Crest<br/><br/>Force Staff is a useful mobility item to purchase that also serves as utility for your team. The extra Intelligence helps with giving Tidehunter a bigger mana pool, and the active ability can be used to better position yourself or allies for casting spells. While not as powerful as Blink Dagger, it is easier to build should you be having trouble farming.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a good mid-game item that gives Tidehunter many great benefits. The increased Intelligence and armor give Tidehunter more mana and survivability, especially if he is playing as a tank rather than initiator, and the active allows Tidehunter to take advantage of his massive health pool to discourage enemies from attacking him further.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a low-cost utility item to help you initiate and contribute more to teamfights. Along with the large intelligence bonus and armor increasing your mana pool and tankiness, the item's active ability allows you to reduce the enemy's magic resistance prior to a Blink-Ravage combo, giving your team's casters an additional edge in teamfights.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a useful utility item that can be purchased as a tank Tidehunter, and builds into Guardian Greaves. On top of giving him armor and more stats, the heal can greatly benefit your team as you are not likely to die before using it. On top of your general durability and ability to interrupt the enemy team's initiation with Ravage, you can further discourage the enemy from engaging you as you can simply heal yourself and your team at any point of the fight. However, mind its expensive mana cost, and be sure to increase the size of your mana pool first if you intend on building this.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a useful chasing item that gives Tidehunter many benefits. The additional HP makes Tidehunter much beefier, while the intelligence gives him a much bigger mana pool. The active ability can be cast over long distances, allowing you to chase down fleeing enemies far more easily and apply Gush to them, slowing them even further.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb gives Tidehunter a myriad of useful bonuses and a strong active ability. The armor and HP regen makes Tidehunter even tankier, while the mana regen keeps his mana pool topped up so that he can more readily cast his spells when needed. The active can purge debuffs, either from Tidehunter or an ally, and the Echo Shell punishes enemies to use targeted spells, especially frail casters with small HP pools.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a strong support item that vastly improves Tidehunter's disabling potential. As he does not otherwise have a hard-disable outside of his ultimate, building Scythe of Vyse allows him to jump on enemies with Blink Dagger and instantly disable them on a regular basis. The item also improves his overall stats and greatly increases his ability to cast all of his spells due to the vast intelligence bonus and scaling mana regen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Timbersaw is an armored brawler who relies on cutting down trees as a mechanic for rapid movement and dealing damage. In the early and mid stages of the game, Timbersaw can be surprisingly durable, staying in the fight and taking out multiple opponents even on the verge of death. His pure damage penetrates armor and magic resistance, making him deadly against all opponents. However, Timbersaw lacks any true disables, and must rely on his mobility to keep up with his enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Highly mobile.<br/><br/>High armor.<br/><br/>High HP regeneration<br/><br/>Deals pure damage.<br/><br/>High mana capacity.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No disables.<br/><br/>Entirely dependent on abilities to deal damage.<br/><br/>Low HP.<br/><br/>Very dependent on Bloodstone<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One of Timbersaw's weaknesses is his lack of disabling spells; he suffers against heroes that excel at channeling spells to harm their opponents. In this case, equip him with an item that has a quick disable, like Eul's Scepter of Divinity.<br/><br/>Aside from escape, Timbersaw's skill set also makes for good chasing. Cut down trees that get in your way to widen your path and even prevent juking.<br/><br/>The trees summoned by Nature's Prophet through Sprout are still standard trees. As an enemy, you can easily cut them down to escape, or free allies who are trapped within it. As an ally, this can be used to your advantage when escaping (as Nature's Prophet can summon trees in a convenient location for you to use Timber Chain) or when fighting (Nature's Prophet can summon trees closer to you when no other tree is present, so that you can deal pure damage when casting Whirling Death).<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Whirling Death</h4>Use Whirling Death during or right after Timber Chain to deal burst damage.<br/><br/>Try to use Whirling Death next to trees to deal pure damage.<br/><br/>The 15% primary attribute reduction from Whirling Death is particularly devastating to strength heroes, who will lose a large amount of HP from strength reduction, on top of damage taken.<br/>This makes Whirling Death deceptively powerful against strength heroes, especially in the early game.<br/><br/>The attribute loss also hurts the opponent's ability to get last hits, so make sure to hit them with it whenever possible.<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Timber Chain</h4>Timber Chain gives Timbersaw tremendous mobility, and has a very low cooldown.<br/><br/>Use Timber Chain to chase or escape from enemies.<br/><br/>Use Timber Chain on trees across impassable terrain and elevations to pull Timbersaw past them.<br/><br/>Timber Chain makes Timbersaw one of the best tower divers, finishing off enemies and pulling himself out before taking much damage.<br/><br/>Timbersaw can use items like Shiva's Guard while being pulled by Timber Chain.<br/><br/>Timber Chain will cause Timbersaw to suffer the effects of Mana Leak and Rupture. Do not use it when affected by those abilities unless absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>Positioning is important when dealing damage with Timber Chain. Move Timbersaw until the enemy is lined up in the middle, between Timbersaw and a target tree.<br/><br/>It takes a brief moment for Timber Chain to destroy the target tree, meaning that Whirling Death should be used to cut down the target tree just before it is destroyed in order to deal pure damage.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Reactive Armor</h4>An early point in Reactive Armor helps Timbersaw stay in lane.<br/><br/>Aside for tanking damage in team fights, Reactive Armor can also be used as a quick health regeneration boost. You can either visit the small creep camps since they do little damage and come in groups, or tank lane creeps when no enemy hero is present. As long as there are multiple targets attacking you in quick succession, the spell will stack faster, and you will be able to heal faster. Make sure you're receiving damage that is lesser than what you are able to regenerate. Purchasing a Stout Shield will allow Timbersaw to do this more effectively.<br/><br/>Beware sources of break such as Silver Edge, as it will disable Reactive Armor.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to dive, as Reactive Armor will activate from tower hits.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Chakram</h4>The Chakram travels somewhat slow, so make sure to predict your target's path and cast it ahead of time.<br/><br/>Use Chakram to slow down a fleeing enemy, or leave it behind to deter pursuers.<br/><br/>Use Chakram to cut down entire areas of trees. This has numerous functions.<br/>To find enemies juking in the trees.<br/><br/>To destroy any potential Eyes In The Forest.<br/><br/>To clear vision in order to spot potential ganks. This is especially useful when laning in the early game, and when attacking a tower.<br/><br/><br/>If you are ready to gank in a side lane and are behind trees, use Chakram to destroy the trees in front of you, then use Timber Chain on the other side of the lane; after this, a well placed Whirling Death can almost ensure a kill in many situations.<br/><br/>When a hero is escaping through only one potential exit, use Chakram to block that path; if successful, the enemy hero will either be forced to run through the blade, losing health immensely and get slowed, or the enemy has to take another route.<br/>To further slow the hero down, cast Whirling Death while the hero is in the middle of the Chakram.<br/><br/><br/>Once the Chakram is deployed, position Timbersaw so that the Chakram will hit as many enemies as possible on its return path.<br/><br/>To lengthen the time an enemy spends in the Chakram, try to body block the enemy by standing directly in their path. You can easily get close to the enemy to do this if there is a tree nearby to Timber Chain to.<br/><br/>Chakram synergizes well with multi-target abilities that disable free movement, such as Black Hole, Overgrowth, or even Kinetic Field.<br/><br/>Chakram works very well against heroes with long channeling abilities,such as Shadow Shaman or Witch Doctor. By casting Chakram while they are channeling, they either have to move and cancel their channeling, or stay and take damage.<br/><br/>Chakram can be used while Timbersaw is being pulled with Timber Chain.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Stout Shield improves Rizzrack's survivability in the laning stage and can build into a Vanguard later in the game.<br/><br/>Clarity potions can regain mana after Rizzrack has used a lot of spells.<br/><br/>Tangoes provide ample regeneration for Rizzrack in the early game, and can also be planted as trees to use in combination with his abilities.<br/><br/>Healing Salve helps Timbersaw stay in lane.<br/><br/>Iron Branches give a small boost to Rizzrack's attributes, and can build into a Magic Wand later in the game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Arcane Boots are the boots of choice for Rizzrack, as they boost his overall mana pool and provide him with a periodic increase of mana for both him and his team. He can disassemble them to use the Energy Booster for his Bloodstone.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is bought because of the increase to Timbersaw's attributes, and because of the useful health and mana restoration it provides.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Bloodstone provides excellent mana regeneration allowing Timbersaw to use his abilities and maintain Chakram almost indefinitely. On top of this, it provides him with a bit more health and health regeneration and the ability to deny himself, which is always good for a hero who has to go deep in fights. It is much better to disassemble Arcane Boots instead of buying another Energy Booster.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Scythe of Vyse allows Rizzrack to disable a single enemy hero, allowing both Rizzrack and his team to completely destroy the targeted hero.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard makes Rizzrack considerably more durable due to the large amount of armor it provides. The large amount of intelligence it provides is also very beneficial as Rizzrack requires a lot of mana and mana regeneration to do well. The active ability also helps Rizzrack kill his foes since the slow allows him to be more precise with all of his spells and it adds another nuke on top of that. Shiva's can also make Rizzrack a decent initiator.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives Timbersaw a second Chakram, allowing him to scale much better into the late game with even higher damage output. However, the mana cost of a second Chakram will deplete his mana very quickly; therefore a mana item like Bloodstone or Scythe of Vyse is mandatory before picking up this item.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is very powerful item for Timbersaw because of his low-cooldown spells. Besides boost to HP and mana pools the spell lifesteal allows him to maintain his own HP pool from that damage and can make him almost unkillable.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight provides Rizzrack with a large boost to his magic resistance, which can be very good against a team that can output a large amount of magical damage. In addition, this item provides a nice amount of health regeneration.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence can be a good pickup if you are having issues with an enemy disabling, silencing, or blinking away from you. On top of the silence the item brings, it gives Timbersaw even more mana regen and bigger mana pool, as well as extra damage output with the burst at the end of the silence. In combination with a Blink Dagger, Timbersaw becomes incredibly fearsome and can punish anyone out of position with ease.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos synergizes very well with Timbersaw, since the increased intelligence will allow him to cast more spells which deal more damage and the health will increase his survivability. The slow from Atos will assist in landing Timbersaw's spells, and the combined with Chakram's slow, it almost always reduces an enemy's movement speed to minimum.<br/><br/>Cloak can be an underrated early game item on Timbersaw, since his biggest weakness before he gets big items are disables and magical damage. With a casual Cloak and Reactive Armor, Timbersaw is very difficult to kill in the early and mid game.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque makes Rizzrack very tanky, as it provides a whopping 1060 additional health. The passive Health Regeneration is also very beneficial for Rizzrack as it means he can use Timber Chain to escape his enemies, and then he can gradually regenerate his health back up to full after this.<br/><br/>Blade Mail allows Rizzrack to use the damage of his enemies against them. It also provides him with a small amount of intelligence, armor and 22 attack damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tiny is a heavy carry with a large amount of health. He is the only hero in the game that grows as he levels up. In the early game, he uses his Avalanche > Toss combo to gank and deal burst damage. As he acquires more items, Tiny transitions into a full-fledged carry, capable of wiping entire teams with his tree, and demolishing buildings in very little time. With a Blink Dagger, Tiny also makes an effective initiator. However, Tiny is susceptible to disables, and can be shut down by intense harassment in the early game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High early game burst damage.<br/><br/>High late game AoE damage.<br/><br/>Passive counters melee carries.<br/><br/>High damage against buildings.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>Needs a good early game.<br/><br/>Very bad starting armor and agility growth<br/><br/>Low attack speed without items<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Tiny has high base attack damage, which makes last hitting a breeze.<br/><br/>Tiny suffers from low mana. In the early game, one ability or ability combo will often use up all his mana.<br/><br/>Tiny has poor lane presence and should be supported by another hero if necessary.<br/><br/>Tiny has great strength gain, but poor intelligence and agility gain.<br/><br/>Despite his appearance, Tiny has fairly low armor and can be quite vulnerable to physical attacks.<br/><br/>While Tiny has the potential to be a relentless force in the late game, his scaling process is delicate. Good players must know how to farm well in the early game to keep pace with other carries.<br/>A poorly farmed Tiny will become a burden to his team in the mid and late game.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Avalanche</h4>Tossed units take double damage from Avalanche, making the two abilities extremely deadly when used together.<br/>An Avalanche + Toss combo is enough to kill many heroes during the early game.<br/><br/>This effect also occurs if you reverse the order by using Toss and then Avalanche. However, Avalanche has a 0.25 second delay for before the stun and damage begins, which means you have 0.25 seconds to cast Toss after Avalanche for the full damage output, whereas Toss begins instantly and lasts 1.3 seconds. You would have to cast Avalanche 0.05 seconds after casting Toss to get the 0.25 second avalanche delay and the 1 second damage and stun to go through. Doing that in the short time window is very hard, so it is generally recommended to cast Avalanche first in order to do the combo.<br/><br/><br/>Avalanche has a 600 cast range, and its radius is slightly larger than its visual effect.<br/><br/>Use Blink Dagger then Avalanche to initiate onto groups of enemies.<br/><br/>Take note that the damage increase per skill point spent is the least efficient for the last point. Whereas each point increases damage by 80 at levels 2 and 3, the last point increases damage by only 40 at level 4. Depending on the circumstance, it may be more prudent to invest that last point into other skills and avoid maxing it during the early stage of the game.<br/><h4>Toss</h4>Toss must target an enemy/allied unit, meaning that Tiny cannot simply Toss units anywhere on the map.<br/>If Toss targets the enemy that is going to be Tossed, that enemy will be thrown straight up in the air, and come back down on the same spot.<br/><br/><br/>Toss cannot target buildings, but will damage them if the Tossed unit hits the building within its AoE radius. To do so, target Toss on an enemy unit next to the building.<br/><br/>Toss can be used as an initiation tool by throwing a hero like Earthshaker or Tidehunter into a group of enemies.<br/><br/>When chasing a fleeing enemy, throw an ally that can stun. This will buy Tiny enough time to catch up.<br/><br/>Toss can be used defensively, throwing enemies away from Tiny.<br/><br/>Toss can be used offensively, throwing enemies into Tiny's teammates.<br/><br/>Tiny will Toss the unit closest to him. He cannot directly choose which target to Toss.<br/>Be careful not to Toss an ally to his death.<br/><br/><br/>Toss works on spell immune enemies.<br/><br/>Toss will interrupt channeled abilities.<br/>Coupled with the above, this means Toss is one of few abilities that interrupt channels even if the enemy is using Black King Bar.<br/><br/><br/>Toss will remove the Cold Feet debuff when used on enemies, even when the target is tossed straight up.<br/><h4>Craggy Exterior</h4>Craggy Exterior is not the most effective ability early game, as few heroes attack fast enough to proc the disable, Tiny can purchase inexpensive items like Ring of Protection to help his low armor, and it's better to have stronger nukes earlier on. Because of this, it usually is maxed last.<br/><br/>Craggy Exterior is an excellent passive for interrupting carries that rely on fast attack speed, such as Troll Warlord or Faceless Void. However, the stun is blocked by spell immunity, so be wary around these heroes when their Black King Bar is active.<br/><h4>Grow</h4>Although it may not look like it due to his increased size, Grow makes Tiny move significantly faster.<br/><br/>Grow gives Tiny the highest natural attack damage in the game, at the cost of degraded attack speed. This slow attack speed can be further exploited by enemies with abilities that slow attack speed.<br/><br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Tiny is arguably the fastest building destroyer in the game.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that levels in Grow will increase the damage of Toss, so in most cases it is preferred to max Toss first to maximize early game damage by level 7 or 8.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Clarity potions will help offset Tiny's tiny mana pool.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Magic Stick restores some health and mana so Tiny can sustain more damage in lane, or use his spells in a pinch.<br/><br/>Bracer is an excellent cost efficient item which can be turned into a Drum of Endurance later on. It provides good bonuses to his attributes as well as an increase to his health pool.<br/><br/>Bottle helps Tiny refill his mana and health pool, especially useful when he is played in the middle lane. With rune control, a Bottle gives Tiny much more survivability than any of the other initial health/mana items.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Magic Wand is an inexpensive upgrade from Magic Stick that gives useful bonuses to Tiny's overall attributes and increases its charge storing capacity.<br/><br/>Power Treads gives attack speed and stats. Switching treads between strength and intelligence on Tiny is important, because his two spells use a lot of mana.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots alleviates Tiny's mana problems early on.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a must-have in the late game. It gives Tiny a cleave, extra auto-attack damage against buildings, extra auto-attack range, and increased Toss damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Blink Dagger can be used in conjunction with the Avalanche/Toss combo, causing massive burst damage to one or more enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can be an alternative to Blink Dagger. It grants attack speed, a good bonus damage of 175 (works only if you hit before using your abilities) and a huge movement speed boost while invisible. The invisibility allows Tiny to position more effectively, while the attack speed synergizes with Grow and allows it to be purchased earlier.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives attack speed, movement speed, mana, stats, and damage for a cheap price.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass gives attack speed, which is well needed after putting some points into Grow, as well as armor, which makes Tiny even tankier. The aura is also useful to the rest of your team.<br/><br/>Black King Bar allows Tiny to attack enemies freely for several seconds, which is important because with a few damage items, Tiny hits like a truck. Also, it gives strength and damage.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque turns Tiny into a true tank, giving him lots of strength, health, and health regeneration.<br/><br/>Daedalus can produce massive critical strike damage, thanks to Tiny's naturally high attack damage.<br/><br/>Manta Style gives a good amount of agility, stats, and movement speed. Also, Tiny's illusions benefit from Grow greatly.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness gives a huge attack speed and movement speed buff in addition to lifesteal for very cheap, but can backfire if not careful.<br/><br/>Moon Shard nearly single-handedly solves Tiny's attack speed issues by granting him a massive 120 attack speed bonus, the highest in the entire game. The shard can later be consumed to be replaced by a more effective item - Even though the attack speed bonus will be halved, it's extremely handy to have 60 extra points of attack speed without needing an inventory slot for it, especially if the shard is to be replaced by other items which grant attack speed and more utility, such as an Assault Cuirass.<br/><br/>Echo Sabre's double attack compensates for Tiny's low attack speed and synergizes very well with his high attack damage, adding even more burst damage to his arsenal. It also grants much-needed mana regeneration and is a reasonably cheap pickup.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Treant Protector is a tough support hero who is able to protect and regenerate allies and friendly buildings with his trademark ability, Living Armor. Hiding himself with Nature's Guise and packing a huge bash, he is one of few supports that can sneak past enemy lines to set up ganks and/or initiate a fight by trapping the opposing team in an Overgrowth. Alone, Treant Protector does little damage and requires good teamwork to be effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global range with Living Armor.<br/><br/>Fairly tanky.<br/><br/>Can heal buildings.<br/><br/>Highest base physical damage in the game at Lvl 1.<br/><br/>AoE Magic Immunity piercing root and disarm.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily countered by vision and true sight.<br/><br/>Very dependent on teammates.<br/><br/>Little offensive power (due to high defensive power).<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Treant Protector's attack animation and rate are slow, but pack a huge punch. With a little practice, he can put that power to use and greatly assist his lane partner by denying units.<br/><br/>Because of his high damage and strength, Treant Protector can sometimes jungle weaker creep camps.<br/><br/>Treant Protector is not very mobile and requires careful positioning, especially before a teamfight.<br/><br/>Keep your eyes over the entire game. Treant Protector can keep allies longer in lane, save them from ganks and heal damaged towers with Living Armor.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Nature's Guise</h4>Nature's Guise is a great ganking ability, and owing to the extremely variable nature of this mechanic the enemy team will struggle to use Sentry Wards to prevent this.<br/><br/>At level 4, the stun duration is 2.2 seconds, and the fade time is 3 seconds, which you can make a stun chain.<br/><br/>Item actives and all of Treant Protector's abilities can be used without breaking invisibility from Nature's Guise.<br/>Active abilities from items like Shiva's Guard and Scythe of Vyse can be used to surprise and play tricks on opponents, as long as Treant Protector stays near the trees.<br/><br/><br/>Use Nature's Guise to scout and place wards.<br/><br/>Nature's Guise provides a bonus to movement speed. Use it to transverse quickly from lane to lane with the jungles as your routes.<br/><h4>Leech Seed</h4>Leech Seed can be used as an early harassment tool.<br/><br/>Use Leech Seed on an enemy fighting an ally to give that ally a healing advantage.<br/><br/>Leech Seed will heal all allied units in a radius around the target, even after the target has died. Be sure to stay around the corpse if the spell hasn't ended to maximise the healing potential.<br/><br/>You can use it as a small pushing tool by healing your creep wave by targeting a nearby melee creep.<br/><br/>Take note that the healing element of the spell is performed over 6 pulses and that the healing projectiles have a fairly slow travel speed. You will need to pre-emptively cast it early during a battle to ensure you will benefit from the healing, as quick and successive bursts of damage may kill you before you gain any life back from the spell.<br/><h4>Living Armor</h4>Living Armor costs very little mana, and should be used as often as possible.<br/><br/>Though Living Armor's damage block visuals are the same as with items such as Stout Shield and Kraken Shell, it actually blocks all types of damage and not just physical. Bear this in mind as, while it protects against all forms of damage, your opponent can use this against you and whittle away the layers with low-cost spells such as Rocket Barrage or Arcane Bolt.<br/>Living Armor is expended every time it blocks over 5 damage, meaning that damage over time abilities will erode it very quickly.<br/>So while each layer is able to block up to a maximum of 80 damage, it will deplete a layer so long as the damage instance is over 5, and effectively lose the other 74 points of damage blocking potential.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Keep an eye on the minimap, as a well-timed Living Armor may make the difference between a farmed team-mate or a farmed enemy. This is especially important during the early game, when heroes are more vulnerable.<br/><br/>If possible, healing the team's jungler during the early game will help that hero greatly.<br/><br/>Always use Living Armor to heal buildings if no teammate needs it. This makes pushing much harder for the enemy team.<br/>Whenever there is a siege creep in the wave, casting Living Armor on your towers can be very effective, as the melee and ranged creeps will actively be engaging with one another before turning their sights onto the tower. With the skill at higher levels, and coupled with the innate slow attack speed of siege units, it is entirely possible for Living Armor to outlast the attack and allow the tower to make it out without a single scratch.<br/><br/><h4>Overgrowth</h4>Overgrowth is best used from the invisibility of Nature's Guise.<br/><br/>Overgrowth prevents blinking, and is useful for locking down slippery heroes.<br/><br/>Overgrowth is dispellable, so be aware of enemies with items such as Manta Style, or skills such as Repel.<br/>Bear in mind that, while Overgrowth is dispellable, it is able to pierce spell immunity entirely. It may be more prudent to draw your opponents into activating their Black King Bar first before casting Overgrowth, as they will be rendered equally helpless under the effects of Overgrowth even if they are spell immune.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Clarity potions mitigate the mana cost of Leech Seed, which is usually used early for lane harassment.<br/><br/>Stout Shield partially abates any harassment he receives.<br/><br/>Animal Courier is expected of support heroes due to their item independence.<br/><br/>Observer Ward is necessary and can be placed when using Nature's Guise.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give a useful movement speed boost.<br/><br/>Iron Talon amplifies Treant's already high base damage and allows to jungle very quickly.<br/><br/>Magic Stick helps with mana and health restoration<br/><br/>Bracer provide cheap attribute bonuses.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is a good early pick-up for Treant Protector, as it allows him to spam his Leech Seed as an effective harassment tool while also healing off the damage from the Soul Ring. It also helps solve his mana problems early to mid game. This could also be picked-up if opting for a Tranquil Boots instead of an Arcane Boots if team-mates do not need the extra mana. Choosing Tranquil Boots over Arcane Boots makes it easier for Treant Protector to roam the map and regenerate health between ganks.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Arcane Boots help with Treant's own mana pool as well as his allies.<br/><br/>Magic Wand makes use of the earlier bought Magic Stick and is another source of a cheap attribute bonus.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter grants Treant Protector basically an infinite amount of "free" Observer Wards. It is an excellent item which allows Treant Protector to grant his team vision over the map and also allows him to deal some damage in the late game with a semi-global Overgrowth.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Guardian Greaves is natural upgrade of Arcane Boots, farmed Treant is very good Mek/Greaves carrier.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance provides more cheap attribute bonuses and the movement speed boost stacks with Nature's Guise's bonus to give him and his allies excellent movement speed.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger allows for more powerful initiaions with Overgrowth. It also allows Treant to dart around the forest while remaining invisible through Nature's Guise.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives him excellent durability and big amount of attack damage, making him able to hit quite hard together with his naturally high attack damage.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard and Assault Cuirass provide protection against physical damage as well as auras that help in a team fight.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight provides him and his allies with protection against magical damage.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering provides Treant and his team with a useful aura.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd provides the single-target disable he lacks, while providing both strength and evasion to increase his durability.<br/><br/>Radiance provides excellent team fight damage. Treant Protector can make use of Radiance's Burn damage while he is invisible.<br/><br/>Necronomicon gives more movement speed and attack speed for his allies, some damage and mana-burning during Overgrowth, and more strength and intelligence.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb allows him to cast Overgrowth twice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tusk is a very strong initiator who can set up fights on his team's terms. His arsenal of crowd control spells can greatly inhibit enemies during fights and ganks, giving allies a powerful edge. Tusk is a ganking specialist as he can hunt fragile heroes throughout the game. However, his skill and aggressive play style can be a double edge against him when it comes to initiating & chasing fleeing enemies as his ice shard can block his teammates from proceed with the chase and he can roll himself into a counter-ganking trap set up by his opponent. Thus, although his skillset is rather straightforward, player should exercise good judgement before consider initiation.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Quite versatile in role.<br/><br/>Powerful disable abilities, especially his ultimate.<br/><br/>High Movement Speed without Boots.<br/><br/>Specialize in ganking.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Quite weak without Desolator or Shadow Blade<br/><br/>Even though he is a strength hero, he has low health<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Beware that while Tusk is a strength hero with strong disables, his mediocre strength growth means that his HP pool will not improve drastically with levels, which inhibits his ability to survive initiations. As such, Tusk benefits from building durability items to give himself more HP and armor, allowing him to do more in fights.<br/><br/>Tusk's reliance on mana-expensive abilities in order to be effective means that he requires a source of mana replenishment in order to keep him in fights. The low cooldown on all of his abilities except Frozen Sigil means that he can greatly impact fights so long as he has the mana to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Tusk has a near-instant 0.1 second cast animation, allowing him to get his spells off very quickly. Good reflexes are necessary in order to make the most of Tusk's spells.<br/><br/>Beware that while Tusk has a strong arsenal of disables, all of them are very short in duration. As such, while Tusk is a strong initiator, he cannot lock down enemies solely by himself, and requires additional disablers on his team in order to take advantage of the disruption he creates amongst the enemy.<br/><br/>Due to his strong array of disables and an ultimate that scales with his damage, Tusk can be played in any number of ways.<br/>Because he can be strong with only levels and does not explicitly require gold, Tusk can be a good support who gets his gold and levels by assisting his carries and setting up kills for them. Because of lack of farm priority, a support Tusk should focus on building cheap utility items and extending the size of his mana pool in order to take utmost advantage of his spells.<br/><br/>Tusk's powerful disables allow him to be played as a roamer who can initiate and set up ganks for teammates. A roaming Tusk is much more active on the map and, given the proper circumstances, can get good gold and levels through kills and assists, hampering the enemy's early game and creating space for his allies to secure an early advantage in a match.<br/><br/>Played as a semi-carry solo off-laner, Tusk can get fast early levels and gold, transitioning into becoming an effective ganker early in a game. He can use his gold to purchase items to give him more fighting power, increasing the potency of Walrus PUNCH! and improving his ability to initiate and survive in fights.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Ice Shards</h4>Ice Shards is a potent nuking spell that deals damage in its path and then creates a barrier at its destination that persists for 7 seconds.<br/><br/>Despite not directly disabling enemies, Ice Shards is considered a very potent disable due to the barrier it creates, which cannot be pathed through except through forced movement items and abilities. Cast properly, Ice Shards can block an enemy's escape path and secure a kill.<br/><br/>Because of its nuking and disabling potential, Ice Shards should be maxed out first among Tusk's abilities. Reducing the cooldown on Ice Shards also allows it to be more readily available for gank opportunities and teamfights.<br/><br/>Ice Shards has an extremely long cast range, able to be cast from just within any enemy's visual range. Take advantage of this by casting it through the Fog of War, or to block an enemy's escape route even when they think that they're safe.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Ice Shards will form its barrier at the targeted location, so aim and timing are crucial in order to make the most of the barrier. If Ice Shards lands short of its target, it will deal no damage and the barrier will only inhibit pursuers' pathing. If it is targeted too far, then the enemy can simply sidestep the barrier.<br/><br/>The best-case scenario is to target Ice Shards so that its destination lines up exactly with where the enemy will be, trapping them within the barrier. This will force them to walk backwards, towards Tusk and his teammates, in order to escape the barrier.<br/><br/>Try to use the terrain to your advantage when casting Ice Shards. Remember that trees will not be destroyed by the barrier, and that the projectile can travel over cliffs, so you can completely immobilize enemies by using ledges and trees to close up the gaps in the barrier.<br/><br/>Due to its low cooldown, Ice Shards can be used as an imperfect nuke for farming and pushing. The projectile's long cast range allows it to hit multiple neutral camps or creep waves in a single cast.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Ice Shards can be used to hinder pursuers' approach path, forcing them to walk around the barrier. Try to use choke points to your advantage, completely cutting pursuers off.<br/><br/>Remember that Ice Shards provides vision around the projectile, and within the barrier for a short duration after forming. This allows the spell to be used to scout high ground or inside treelines, potentially pinning down any waiting enemies in the process.<br/><h4>Snowball</h4>Snowball is an initiating and mobility spell that lets Tusk close the distance to enemies, bringing teammates along for the ride and damaging and stunning any enemies it hits along the way.<br/><br/>Snowball's primary use is to help low-mobility allies get within melee range of enemies during initiations. This is particularly useful in the early game when powerful allied initiators have not purchased a Blink Dagger yet, as the initiation assist can help to get off powerful but short-ranged area disables such as Slithereen Crush, Berserker's Call, Hoof Stomp, Ravage, and so on.<br/><br/>Next to Ice Shards, Snowball is a strong candidate for a spell to max out early in the game, due to its nuking and disable potential. The damage it deals early in matches makes it a very potent spell to have handy.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Snowball's gathering and rolling time can be used as shelter against enemy attacks and spells. Because units inside the Snowball are invulnerable, it can be used to grant up to 3 seconds of invulnerability to Tusk and any nearby allies, and then stun nearby enemies upon launch.<br/><br/>Be extremely careful about which unit is targeted for Snowball, as highly mobile enemies can simply kite the Snowball back and force Tusk and any allies within to emerge in an extremely disadvantageous position. Try to target slower enemies with no mobility spells or items, or target them from the Fog of War in order to give them as little warning as possible.<br/><br/>Tusk is muted and disarmed during Snowball, but is not silenced, meaning that while he cannot use items or attack, he can still cast spells. This means that Tusk can ready a Walrus PUNCH! while rolling towards a target, or block off their retreat with Ice Shards during approach.<br/><br/>Unlike most other unit-targeted spells, Snowball is not blocked by Linken's Sphere, and will target, chase and stun enemies regardless (beware, Lotus Orb will still reflect the spell upon impact). Use this to your advantage to initiate on slippery foes and use a cheap unit-targeted ability or item to break their Linken's Sphere while they are stunned.<br/><h4>Frozen Sigil</h4>Frozen Sigil summons a flying, controllable ward that reduces the movement and attack speed of all enemies within its radius.<br/><br/>Frozen Sigil applies a strong slowing debuff to all nearby enemies. The sigil can be moved to apply its aura more precisely during a teamfight or to slow enemies who are either fleeing or pursuing.<br/><br/>Due to its poor scaling, Frozen Sigil should generally be maxed out last, however, an early value point should still be taken to provide vision and a ranged slow. Its slows become potent only later in matches when attack speed starts increasing to meaningful values.<br/><br/>Because it is a controllable flying unit, Frozen Sigil should be assigned a command group in order to allow easier positioning of both the sigil and Tusk himself. Both need to be constantly controlled and moved during engagements in order to make the most out of the ability.<br/><br/>Due to its flying movement and vision, Frozen Sigil can be used to scout out enemy movement and dodge enemy attempts to destroy it. In particular, the sigil can be used to safely scout inside Roshan's pit.<br/><br/>Beware that Frozen Sigil grants a substantial gold bounty to enemies who successfully destroy it, so take special care not to feed it to the enemy.<br/><br/>Unlike other wards, Frozen Sigil can be loaded into Snowball and will emerge at the destination; the load command must be issued from Tusk rather than from the sigil. This can be an effective way to save time, as Frozen Sigil's long duration means it will likely persist for longer than the engagement requires. Alternatively, Frozen Sigil may be cast en route to the target, as Tusk is not silenced during Snowball.<br/><h4>Walrus PUNCH!</h4>Walrus PUNCH! allows Tusk to uppercut the target enemy, or the next enemy he attacks when auto cast, stunning them for 1 second and dealing tremendous physical damage, then slowing them for a short duration afterward.<br/><br/>Because Walrus PUNCH! allows Tusk to land a guaranteed 3.5x critical hit on an enemy, it can scale with his physical damage. Increasing Tusk's physical damage or decreasing the enemy's armor will allow him to deal more damage with the ability, which can increase his initiating alpha or finish off enemies at low health.<br/><br/>The spell's greatest strength is that it can uppercut enemies through spell immunity, stunning them even through Black King Bar or abilities like Blade Fury and Repel. This can be useful for interrupting enemy attempts to use Town Portal Scroll during spell immunity to escape, or if they are channeling powerful ultimates such as Death Ward or Fiend's Grip.<br/><br/>In concert to the above, it can be wise to leave your punch in reserve when ganking an enemy. Enemies may attempt to simply teleport to safety after an initiating alpha strike if Tusk lacks damage output or the enemy is very tanky, so saving your ultimate for such situations can prevent them from escaping.<br/><br/>At level 18, its cooldown shortens down to 12 seconds, allowing the spell to be used to start and finish an engagement. Be mindful, however, that its mana cost also increases with level, so be sure to increase the size of Tusk's mana pool to account for this.<br/><br/>Remember that Tusk will always be commanded to attack any enemy that he targets with Snowball upon emerging. Because Tusk can still cast spells inside Snowball, casting Walrus PUNCH! during the approach, or activating auto-cast, will cause him to automatically uppercut the Snowball target upon arriving.<br/><br/>It is an active attack modifier and thus simply modifies Tusk's next attack, meaning that it is not blocked by Linken's Sphere. However, this also means that it cannot hit units in Ethereal form.<br/>Additionally, it is not affected by blindness or evasion, so the resulting attack will always connect, making it particularly useful against Heroes like Phantom Assassin and Windranger.<br/><br/>As it is an active attack modifier, it cannot be stolen with Spell Steal.<br/><br/>Despite behaving like an active attack modifier, Walrus Punch will trigger all on-cast effects like Arcane Curse.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tangos and Healing Salve give Tusk HP sustain in-lane, allowing him to survive enemy harass and continue gaining gold and experience.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Tusk to replenish his mana pool from casting spells, important since all of his basic spells are very expensive and will consume a sizable fraction of his small base mana pool. In particular, Ice Shards can consume almost half of Tusk's mana pool, so having enough mana to cast his full combo can make or break getting First Blood.<br/><br/>Iron Branch and Circlet give Tusk all-around attributes, important for beefing up his HP, base damage and mana to increase his survivability in-lane. They allow Tusk to immediately build a Magic Wand from the Side Lane Shop once he has enough gold.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango is a useful starting item to purchase, as it gives Tusk some passive HP regen, mitigating harass damage, and a way to instantly replenish mana for casting his spells in a pinch.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is particularly useful if Tusk is played as an off-laner, as the damage block will give him increased resistance to enemy harass. It can be upgraded later into a Vanguard to increase Tusk's beefiness and increase his survivability during initiations.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed is important to purchase early on, as Tusk relies on good positioning in order to make the most of his spells. He can more easily chase down enemies during ganks, or escape pursuers.<br/><br/>Magic Wand can be immediately built using already-purchased attribute items. The charge storage allows Tusk to immediately replenish his HP and mana, which can make or break fights or ganks given his powerful spells.<br/><br/>Bracer provides Tusk with an assortment of attributes, primarily strength for increased HP and base damage. It can later be used to build a Drum of Endurance.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a strong pickup in any situation, but particularly if Tusk is a roamer. Applying the slow debuff can reduce an enemy's chances of escaping, and stacks alongside Frozen Sigil to help chase down fleeing enemies.<br/><br/>Bottle is very powerful on mobile initiators like Tusk, since he can roam and set up kills for his team, and as such benefits from always being at full HP and mana should a gank opportunity arise. As well, he can take advantage of runes to increase his initiating power.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots gives Tusk an assortment of powerful benefits, making it the best boots for him. The increased movement speed allows him to position more easily to cast his spells, and allows him to more easily chase down fleeing enemies in combination with Frozen Sigil. The bonus damage improves Tusk's ability to last-hit to farm, and increases the damage done with Walrus PUNCH!<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Tusk all-around stats that give him more HP, damage, and a larger mana pool to work with. The aura improves his mobility and gives his team a fighting edge when engaging the enemy.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to carry at all times. Tusk's strong crowd control and initiation abilities makes him a powerful ally to have when ganking a lone enemy, or starting a teamfight on his own terms.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows gives Tusk many benefits for a cheap price. As a highly mobile ganker, Tusk can easily get charges with which to heal himself and teammates or deal more damage in ganks; as well, Urn charges can instantly put enemy Blink Daggers on cooldown from a distance. The item also provides strength, giving Tusk more HP and base damage, and scaling mana regen to help him to cast spells more easily.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Desolator gives Tusk increased bonus damage, and allows him to apply an armor debuff to enemies, particularly when combined with Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade increases Tusk's physical damage output, and gives him yet another initiation ability. Shadow Walk can be used to deal tremendous physical damage to a gank target with Walrus PUNCH!, or can be cast to escape in a tight situation.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is very expensive but increases Tusk's HP significantly, allowing him to stay alive for much longer after initiating with Snowball. The increased strength also gives Tusk more base damage, improving the potency of Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Black King Bar ensures Tusk is protected from most disables, allowing him to continue fighting and casting his spells after a successful initiation. The extra strength gives him more HP and damage, while the extra damage gives him more physical damage output.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd helps make Tusk a better all-around fighter through its various bonuses. It grants more HP and evasion for increased survivability, more base damage and bonus damage to make his attacks hit harder, a Lesser Maim that can debilitate enemies in fights, and a Disarm that can outright prevent enemies from using their right-clicks.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is a strong aura and fighting item that, while expensive, can greatly improve Tusk's damage output. The increased armor makes Tusk much tankier, and the attack speed helps him to deal more damage. The aura can be easily utilized due to Snowball giving Tusk a way to get close to enemies, and its armor debuff can increase the hitting power of Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a very cheap utility item that gives Tusk many strong benefits for its price. The armor helps make Tusk tankier, and the mana regen helps to sustain his expensive but powerful spells. Using the active on an enemy during initiation can increase the amount of damage they take from Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter unlocks Walrus Kick, greatly increasing Tusk's impact in fights and ganks. The item also makes Tusk tankier and improves his mana pool to sustain his spell casting.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb gives Tusk increased survivability when initiating against powerful enemies. Besides giving him more armor to aid survivability, Echo Shell allows Tusk to use the enemy's unit-targeted spells against them should they attempt to target him during initiations, and can otherwise give him a larger window to act while the enemy hesitates. The scaling mana regen also helps Tusk to maintain casting his spells.<br/><br/>Upgrading Shadow Blade into a Silver Edge can greatly augment Tusk's initiating power. Besides improving Tusk's damage output, applying a Break to an important target can disable their passive abilities and cripple their damage output, making them a much smaller threat in an engagement.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is powerful in many situations. As Tusk requires good positioning to use his spells, Blink Dagger can allow him to immediately get within range to cast a disable. In a pinch, it can also be used to jump on top of a beleaguered ally to protect them with Snowball, or as an escape mechanism after casting Snowball to protect himself long enough for it to come off cooldown.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a powerful survivability item that fills in many of Tusk's deficiencies. The armor makes him tankier, the intelligence shores up his small mana pool, and the damage improves the potency of Walrus PUNCH!. Using the active can discourage enemies from attacking Tusk, and can allow him to use his HP pool offensively against gank targets who try to fight back.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is a cheap fighting item that gives Tusk an assortment of bonuses. It provides armor and HP regen, aiding Tusk's survivability, and the active gives him bonus strength and damage, giving him more HP and damage output in an engagement, particularly increasing the damage that Walrus PUNCH! deals.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is an all-around fighting item that improves Tusk's ability to engage enemies in teamfights. The improved movement speed allows Tusk to position for his spells and chase down fleeing enemies, and the strength and bonus damage give him better battlefield presence. The Greater Maim also allows him to debilitate enemies' attempts to fight him and his team.<br/><br/>Battle Fury is an unorthodox but useful item for a roaming Tusk. While it is generally considered a core farming item, it provides Tusk with many useful benefits. The HP and mana regen allow him to roam more independently, while the cleave can help him to farm more items for himself. The ability to cut trees allows Tusk to position himself for casting his spells from unorthodox locations, or simply path through the jungle more easily, and the increased damage allows him to deal more damage with Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Radiance is expensive to farm, but allows Tusk to fight more effectively against enemies. The area burn allows Tusk to damage all nearby enemies in the midst of initiations, particularly as he can easily get into the middle of their formation with Snowball, and the induced miss chance also gives him survivability against auto-attacks. The bonus damage also allows him to deal tremendous damage with Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar drastically improves Tusk's damage output, and allows him to hit enemies through evasion and blind. The raw damage increase makes Walrus PUNCH! much stronger as well.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives Tusk attributes across the board, making him much tankier and giving him a bigger mana pool to work with. The Cold Attack modifier also allows him to slow enemies with his attacks, stacking alongside Frozen Sigil to magnify his battlefield presence.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade gives Tusk a chance to bash enemies he attacks while the active can give Tusk even more lockdown on top of his other disables, particularly as it can stun through spell immunity.<br/><br/>Tusk's spells allow him to provide strong utility for his team when not built to take advantage of his ultimate. Several items can help him to this end:<br/><br/>Soul Ring is very cheap and can be easily purchased in the early game. It provides mana and HP regen, allowing Tusk to roam more independently, and lets Tusk dip into his HP pool to cast his spells, allowing him to be more active on the map.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots increases the size of Tusk's mana pool and gives him a means with which to replenish it, along with that of his teammates. Being able to easily sustain his own mana pool allows Tusk to stay on the go and use his spells to set up kills for his team.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a strong utility item that increases Tusk's mobility. It provides intelligence, improving his mana pool, and gives him HP regen to keep his health topped up. The active can be used as an initiation booster to help Tusk position himself to cast his spells, as a quick escape, or can be used on allies to re-position them for various purposes. It can also be cast on enemies to dis-position them, or to break an enemy Linken's Sphere during initiation.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a useful mid-game utility item that provides Tusk with a strong teamfight aura. It provides Tusk and allies with additional armor and HP regen, improving their survivability, and some mana regen to allow Tusk to maintain his mana pool more easily. The increased damage also provides Tusk's team with an edge in fights, and helps Tusk to deal more damage with Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives Tusk increased casting ability, along with providing other strong bonuses. Its intelligence and scaling mana regen bonuses solve all of Tusk's casting problems, allowing him to always have a full mana pool to deal with any situation, and its movement speed bonus increases the potency of Phase Boots and Drum of Endurance, allowing Tusk to be far more mobile. The cyclone can be used to provide Tusk with another invulnerability ability on top of Snowball, purging debuffs from himself at the same time, or can be cast on enemies as an additional disable during initiations.<br/><br/>Solar Crest can be upgraded from Medallion of Courage, and provides Tusk with many of the same benefits. The extra armor and evasion make him increasingly tanky during initiations, and applying the debuff to an enemy will cause them to take even more damage from Walrus PUNCH!.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is well-suited to improving Tusk's survivability and casting potential. It greatly improves Tusk's HP pool, making him tankier and more able to survive during initiations, and a large amount of intelligence to drastically increase the size of his mana pool. The extremely long range on the active allows Tusk to drastically slow a target enemy from a great distance, and the slow can be combined with that of Frozen Sigil, enough to almost completely immobilize an enemy. As well, the long cast range allows it to be used to paralyze an enemy prior to casting Snowball, preventing enemies without blink or haste abilities from outrunning it.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a strong utility item that can give Tusk increased survivability against magic nukes. The magic resistance helps him to survive during initiations once his HP pool is large enough, and the active can shield him and his teammates from enemy magic nukes for a time.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard can be upgraded from Vanguard, and allows Tusk to increase his team's resistance to physical damage. The additional armor greatly improves Tusk's tankiness on top of the increased HP and damage block, and using the active can further protect him and his teammates against the enemy's physical attacks.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is an expensive utility item but synergizes strongly with Tusk's ability to disable enemies. It provides a great amount of armor, making Tusk more tanky, and drastically improves his mana pool through bonus intelligence, ensuring that he can always have enough mana to cast his spells. The aura and active can slow enemy movement and attack speed even further on top of Frozen Sigil, and the active can be used prior to casting Snowball in order to apply the blast to the entire enemy team during initiations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Underlord is a durable support who takes charge on the battlefield, creating dangerous hazards over large areas, while teleporting his team across the map with Dark Rift. He excels at trapping enemies in a Pit of Malice, and blunting physical damage inside his Atrophy Aura. With the health of a strength hero and the extra damage from Atrophy Aura, Underlord can stand his ground better than most supports. However, Underlord is slow and lumbering, and often suffers from insufficient mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Excellent zoning abilities.<br/><br/>Tankier than most supports.<br/><br/>Reduces enemy damage.<br/><br/>Strong potential for sudden pushes.<br/><br/>Not item dependent.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>Damage scales poorly into the late game.<br/><br/>Requires good team coordination.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of the long durations on Firestorm and Pit of Malice, Underlord specializes in area denial, zoning enemies out in teamfights.<br/><br/>Underlord does not have a lot of mana. Use his abilities strategically.<br/><br/>Underlord should remain close to his team, and be present at all fights to make good use of Atrophy Aura.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Firestorm</h4>Targeting Firestorm, assuming Underlord is behind Crystal Maiden. A. Low damage. Target quickly walks out of radius. B. Minimal damage. Target sees Firestorm ahead and changes direction. C. Maximum damage. Target must walk through radius.<br/><h4>Pit of Malice</h4>Pit of Malice is especially effective against melee carries.<br/><br/>Due to its long duration, allies can stand around Pit of Malice to use it as a buffer against aggressive attackers.<br/><br/>Use Pit of Malice on chokepoints to block off enemies.<br/><br/>Use Pit of Malice on the edge of high ground to act as a trap, causing enemies without vision to walk into a disable.<br/><br/>Use Pit of Malice to bisect enemy formations and cut off pursuers.<br/><br/>Use Pit of Malice to funnel enemies into a narrow space, forcing them to group up.<br/><br/>Use Pit of Malice as a barrier to stop a charging enemy, such as Spirit Breaker or Slark.<br/><br/>Use Pit of Malice in conjunction with Eul's Scepter of Divinity's cyclone for an easy chain disable.<br/>Keep an eye on enemies who often buy Eul's Scepter of Divinity, like Death Prophet, Lina, or Puck. Use Pit of Malice underneath them when they cyclone themselves defensively.<br/><br/><br/>Set up Pit of Malice as a trap against initiating heroes, who may blink into and become rooted.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Pit of Malice is only a root. It does not stop enemies from using abilities, items, or attacking targets within their range.<br/>This means that when retreating, it may be wiser to simply keep running instead of stopping to casting Pit of Malice. Doing so may allow the enemy to get close enough to land a powerful ability, even if they become rooted in the process.<br/><br/><h4>Atrophy Aura</h4>Atrophy Aura provides Underlord with numerous positioning possibilities, which players should keep in mind at all times.<br/><br/>During the laning phase, stand close to enemy melee heroes to lower their damage and make it harder for them to land last hits.<br/>Denied creeps will also boost Underlord's damage.<br/><br/><br/>Staying near your teammates will not only protect them from nearby attacks, it will also give you bonus damage from any enemies they kill.<br/><br/>Move towards dying enemies to collect Atrophy Aura's damage bonus.<br/><br/>Move towards attacking enemies to reduce their damage and potentially save an ally.<br/><br/>While most supports stay in the backline, Underlord can try and take a more forward position to cover enemies with Atrophy Aura.<br/>Balance this strategy when faced with dangerous situations, as a dead Underlord is no good to his team.<br/><br/><br/>Atrophy Aura is most effective against heroes that rely on stats for damage, such as Drow Ranger.<br/><br/>Atrophy Aura allows Underlord to farm the jungle better than most supports.<br/><br/>Clear a camp or wave of creeps to boost Underlord's damage before an upcoming fight.<br/><h4>Dark Rift</h4>Dark Rift is not a channeled ability, meaning it cannot be interrupted with damage or disables. Underlord can also move after its initial cast animation.<br/><br/>Use Dark Rift as a fast pushing ability right after winning a teamfight.<br/>Teleport your team to push in a lane while the enemy is down.<br/><br/>Teleport your team to Roshan to claim the Aegis of the Immortal before the enemy respawns.<br/><br/><br/>Use Dark Rift on a unit or creep wave behind the enemy for a wraparound or pincer attack.<br/>This is especially effective when the enemy team is sieging your tier three towers.<br/><br/><br/>Keep summoned units or enchanted creeps in critical locations, such as the Roshan Pit, for instant access through Dark Rift.<br/><br/>Use Smoke of Deceit along with Dark Rift for more effective team ganks.<br/><br/>Remember that using Dark Rift on the entire team is akin to putting all your eggs in one basket. It can be highly rewarding, but also highly risky.<br/>A well placed Dark Rift can take the enemy by surprise or destroy an important building.<br/><br/>A poorly placed Dark Rift can bring your team into an ambush, resulting in a teamwipe.<br/><br/><br/>Make sure that the creep or building you're teleporting to is safe and out of the enemy's reach.<br/>Dark Rift's target unit will be marked by a very bright effect that is visible to the enemy.<br/><br/>If the teleport target is killed, Dark Rift is wasted and goes on a long cooldown.<br/><br/>If the enemy has vision of the teleport target, they can easily initiate on your team.<br/><br/>Keep track of enemy wards, and deward when possible to avoid teleporting your team into a bad situation.<br/><br/><br/>Be careful both when casting and exiting Dark Rift, as your closely-packed team presents an easy target for enemy initiators and nukers.<br/>Since teammates will follow and gather around Underlord for Dark Rift, it is your responsibility to pick a safe location to use it.<br/><br/><br/>Remember that bringing your team to the enemy base also leaves your own base open to attack. Encourage teammates to carry Town Portal Scroll.<br/><br/>Move alongside teammates when retreating to teleport them out to safety.<br/>Or, cast Dark Rift first, then move next to an ally with Blink Dagger or Force Staff to instantly teleport them to safety.<br/><br/><br/>Use Dark Rift to counter or intercept an incoming gank.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango helps Underlord stay in lane.<br/><br/>Clarity helps Underlord with his low mana.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is a good item for playing in the offlane, as it synergizes well Atrophy Aura. Later, it can be built into a Vanguard or a Crimson Guard.<br/><br/>Iron Branch provides a decent boost to Underlord's stats.<br/><br/>Circlet provides a decent boost to Underlord's stats.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Wind Lace offsets Underlord's slow movement speed and lack of mobility.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed is mandatory on all heroes.<br/><br/>Magic Stick can save Underlord in a bad situation, and can be used to give him enough mana for another ability.<br/><br/>Headdress keeps Underlord and his ally in lane, and can be built into a Mekansm later.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows provides Underlord with a heal, increased mana regeneration, and more strength.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots can be considered to give Underlord some much needed mana.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is a natural evolution from Magic Stick.<br/><br/>Mekansm helps keep Underlord's team alive.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is good for initiating with Pit of Malice.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity helps Underlord with his low mana, and boosts his movement speed to keep enemies within Atrophy Aura's range. The cyclone active helps him set up Pit of Malice.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Guardian Greaves is a natural upgrade from Arcane Boots and Mekansm.<br/><br/>Necronomicon can be used in conjunction with Dark Rift for very fast pushing. At level 3, it will also help Underlord reveals invisible enemies to trap with Pit of Malice.<br/><br/>Blade Mail deters enemies from attacking Underlord.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard along with Atrophy Aura greatly diminishes enemy damage against Underlord and his team.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard helps Underlord keep enemies within range of Atrophy Aura.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass combined with Atrophy Aura greatly reduces enemy damage output.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives Underlord great durability, and allows him to hit even harder.<br/><br/>Radiance is a highly situational item, and is great for teamfights and pushes. Burning down creeps is a good way to feed Atrophy Aura's bonus damage bonus, and the extra evasion make Underlord even more durable.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight reducing incoming magic damage, making Underlord and his team even more durable.<br/><br/>Force Staff improves Underlord's mobility, and lets him push enemies into Pit of Malice.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb helps deflect magical nuke damage, and is useful on team carries when pushing lanes.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere shields Underlord and his teammates from being disabled.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Undying usually serve as a lane support/tanker role in the team. His skillset allows player to harass enemy off the lane meanwhile helping his carry to secure space to farm. Dirge truly shines during every coordinated teamfight due to his plague aura and tombstone, forcing his enemy to either kill him or suffer the debuff consequences.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong harassing ability<br/><br/>Formidable team fight presence<br/><br/>Can play extremely aggressively in the early game<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Relies on items and Decay stacks for durability due to mediocre Strength gain and abysmal Agility gain.<br/><br/>Pathetic scaling into the late game unless incredibly farmed.<br/><br/>No hard disables, needs to be relatively close to enemies in order to contribute to fights.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Undying can be played in many ways: if you are going for a more supportive role, use your Tombstone and your Flesh Golem to slow the enemies while spamming Decay, then let your lane partner get the kill. Otherwise, use Soul Rip to finish a Hero while there are many creeps nearby: this way it deals more damage.<br/><br/>While initiating, use Tombstone and Flesh Golem, then Decay/Soul Rip: this way these abilities deal more damage.<br/><br/>Though his spells are individually quite cheap, you almost always have mana problems since both Soul Rip and especially Decay are very spammable. Consider getting Arcane Boots during the laning phase, then disassembling it once you have enough to buy the remaining pieces of a Bloodstone. You can then convert your standard boots to Phase Boots allowing you the mobility and chase power to keep Flesh Golem's powerful aura on the right targets during a teamfight.<br/><br/>Another good item for Undying in the early game is Soul Ring. After using Soul Ring, you can cast decay for free. If you hit 2 or more heroes with this spell, you make up for the HP cost for Soul Ring.<br/><br/>If you do not have enough gold to buy a Bloodstone in time or you would prefer cheaper items, try to make yourself as tanky as possible: if you are initiating, enemies target you first. That is why you need an early Vanguard and/or a Hood of Defiance if the opposing team has a lot of nukers. Other useful items that increase your HP are Rod of Atos, which solves most of your mana problems too, and Heart of Tarrasque.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Decay</h4>Decay is very useful even if left at level 1. Max it when team battles begin to start: you can spam it even more and make enemies squishier.<br/><br/>Be aware and take note of your mana consumption, however. With it's incredibly low cooldown and rather high mana cost, it's very easy to end up in a situation where you are unable to cast your other spells or item abilities.<br/><h4>Soul Rip</h4>Do not use Soul Rip to harass, but use it to heal a friendly hero or to finish off enemies. This is more effective if there are many units nearby, such as creeps if you are laning, or heroes if you are initiating.<br/>Tombstone is often a great way to maximise the damage/healing potential of Soul Rip, especially when the creep waves from both factions have just begun to engage in battle.<br/><br/><br/>Soul Rip works very well with heroes that can summon additional creeps or create illusions, such as with Broodmother's spiderlings or Phantom Lancer's illusions. The mass amounts of summons and illusions can easily bring your Soul Rip to maximum effect, making such heroes powerful partners to gank with.<br/><br/>When using Soul Rip to damage an opponent, remember to use Decay before. Since Soul Rip deals a static amount of damage, it will deal more if the enemy's maximum health is reduced before rather than after.<br/><h4>Tombstone</h4>If a ward spot is nearby at the outset of a fight, remember that you can cast your Tombstone on top of it, making it invisible to enemy heroes (unless they have a ward up there). You can also use the Tombstone as a temporary ward anywhere thanks to its long duration, but this is not usually advised as it has a lengthy cooldown.<br/><br/>Attacks from illusions will count as hero attacks for the purposes of destroying the Tombstone. Keep that in mind when placing the Tombstone if the enemy team has heroes like Phantom Lancer or Naga Siren.<br/><br/>If Naga Siren is on your team, be aware that Tombstone summons zombies even when the enemy targets are sleeping and untargetable. This can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/>Should the enemy team have an Earthshaker, it is unwise to place a tombstone at the beginning of a teamfight. Each zombie causes the echo to deal extra damage, likely obliterating your entire team (or at the very least severely injuring them).<br/><br/>Zombies are spell immune and require a certain amount of attacks to kill. Therefore they are unaffected by most AoE spells but take full damage from multishot-type abilities. Be aware of heroes with these abilities that can easily deal with your Tombstone zombies, such as Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon.<br/><h4>Flesh Golem</h4>Flesh Golem increases the damage done to and slows down any nearby enemies, and it should be cast early in order to maximise its effect to the fullest.<br/>The damage amplification and slow are affected by the distance between Undying and his enemies, being greater the closer he is to them. As such, you would need to be in the thick of it to ensure that the effect are at its greatest.<br/><br/><br/>Flesh Golem heals Undying for his own maximum health by 2% per non-Hero units and 6% per Hero. Building up HP-items would thus greatly increase his survivability and allow him to make use of the healing to its fullest effect.<br/><br/>Do not be afraid to activate Flesh Golem in order to escape, as the slow effect, coupled with Undying's relatively high natural movement speed, may be just enough to outrun a number of melee heroes.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are standard regeneration items that should be bought to sustain in lane.<br/><br/>Clarity helps Undying spam out more spells in the early game.<br/><br/>Stout Shield allows Undying to put up with a lot of harassment in the early game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Ring of Basilius provides a good amount of mana regeneration and armor for Undying to use.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows can heal you after killing an enemy, and combined with Soul Rip increases your nuke power in a fight.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots are another way to help with Undying's lackluster mana pool, as well as provide mana to his allies.<br/><br/>Mekansm's stats, health regen and armor help you and your allies. Can be upgraded later to Guardian Greaves.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Hood of Defiance and Vanguard are a great way to deal with magical and physical damage on the enemy team, respectively.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a direct upgrade to Hood of Defiance that can be used to benefit your whole team.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard provides both of Undying's needs in tankiness and mana.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a great choice if you are getting focused down in teamfights too much.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is an obviously great disable and mana regeneration item for Undying.<br/><br/>Purchase Guardian Greaves if you are going to build Arcane Boots combined with Mekansm. Guardian Greaves give more armor and health regen, also the heal is mana-free.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Wraith King is a durable carry with a reliable stun. As his ultimate, Reincarnation, effectively doubles his health in a teamfight, he is commonly built as a tank carry. He is traditionally popular among new players for his survivability and potentially simple playstyle. However, Wraith King can also be played at a high level of skill, particularly by using active items.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great durability<br/><br/>High Survivability<br/><br/>Reliable Stun<br/><br/>Rather easy to learn<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low mana pool<br/><br/>Slow attack speed and movement speed<br/><br/>Low armor in early to mid game<br/><br/>Mostly countered by heroes who can mana burn<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Due to Wraith King's sustainability, he usually should initiate fights and tank up some damage first. Sometimes, it is great to even die first, triggering Reincarnation which heavily slows every nearby enemy. At this point, the enemies usually either prepare to take him down again, or try to escape when they can't take him down a second time. This is the perfect opportunity for Wraith King's team to follow up and catch the enemies off-guard.<br/>Besides these, dying as last as Wraith King basically just wastes his Reincarnation, since he cannot do much on his own after respawning besides dying a second time right away.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Wraithfire Blast</h4>Wraithfire Blast} is a decent nuke early on, which also allows Ostarion to disable and slow at the same time. A perfect tool for ganks and team fights, it has a relatively low cooldown, but its relatively high mana cost does not allow it to be used frequently. It should be saved for when it is really needed.<br/><br/>It is generally best to have Wraithfire Blast maxed first as both of Ostarion's passives are not very effective in the laning stage, since both are based on attack damage.<br/><h4>Vampiric Aura</h4>Having Vampiric Aura active during the laning phase shifts the creeps equilibrium, since it also affects the allied lane creeps, forcing Wraith King to farm and fight closer to the enemy tower, which makes him more susceptible to enemy ganks in the early game. If no early pushes are planned, it should be toggled off until after the laning phase.<br/><br/>Vampiric Aura's life-stealing particles are hidden from the enemy so long as they do not have vision of Wraith King, so there isn't a need to toggle it off when jungling or ambushing to mask Wraith King's location.<br/><h4>Mortal Strike</h4>Unlike other sources of critical strike, Mortal Strike deals more damage against non-Hero units than against Heroes. If Wraith King has a source of cleave (e.g. Magnus' Empower or a Battle Fury), he is potentially able to deal even more damage to Heroes indirectly through the splash damage than by actually attacking them head-on, especially if the enemy Heroes are under Armor-enhancing buffs.<br/><h4>Reincarnation</h4>Reincarnation has quite a high mana cost for a Wraith King's rather low mana pool and regeneration. It is best to always keep his mana pool high enough for Reincarnation to trigger, or to make sure that enough charges of his Magic Stick are present in case of an emergency.<br/>Another possible solution to this problem is to have a Soul Ring, since it grants enough mana to sustain Reincarnation's mana cost when already having at least some left-over mana, unless the enemies have mana burning capabilities. The health loss from Soul Ring's active ability is usually not a problem thanks to Vampiric Aura.<br/><br/><br/>It is generally beneficial for Wraith King to die first during a gank, as the slow only activates upon his death, which will greatly benefit his other team members. This prevents the enemies from effectively escaping or attacking back, allowing Wraith King's allies to pick off their targets with ease.<br/>Additionally, if Wraith King is the last to die, the benefit of the slow is greatly reduced, as there would be no allies around to make the most of the slow.<br/><br/><br/>The Aghanim's Scepter bonus works even while Wraith King is reincarnating himself. Allies will still enter Wraith form so long as they are within range of Wraith King when they perish.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tango help Wraith King sustain his health against lane harassment.<br/><br/>Clarity gives Ostarion more opportunities to set up kills early on with Wraithfire Blast.<br/><br/>Iron Branches give Wraith King enough mana pool to cast Wraithfire Blast two times at level 1.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade is an excellent starting item for Ostarion as it allows him to get last hits easier. It also makes Mortal Strike hit harder against creeps which makes you clean camps and creep waves faster. Increases the effectiveness of Vampiric Aura when attacking creeps. It can be used to cut trees and move faster from one camp to another while farming the jungle.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Magic Stick can sometimes be the difference between a death and a kill. Its active usually grants enough mana to sustain Reincarnation. It also combos with Armlet of Mordiggian toggle, as one can deactivate, use magic stick, and reactivate buying enough time for it to provide the 500 bonus hp.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed provide an excellent boost of speed for any hero.<br/><br/><br/><b>Mid-game items:</b><br/>Magic Wand provides the same kind of benefit as the Magic Stick does, but it also provides a small amount of attributes. It makes great use of the earlier bought branches, making room for new items.<br/><br/>Power Treads provides attack speed which is one of Ostarion's main needs. Attribute switching also make his limited mana pool go much further if the treads are switched to intelligence before casting a spell. Due to Mortal Strike and his already high base damage it is better to leave treads in agility form to achieve maximum dps. One can use strength if tanking is essential or if last hitting is difficult.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is a very cost efficient item which provides lots of damage at cost of health degen, however Vampiric Aura easily negates the health drain effect making it Ostarion's main core item.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger solves another of Ostarion deficiency, mobility. It negates countering through kiting, helps with positioning, as well as moving across the maps quicker, thus increasing farm speed. Another possible trick is to instantly blink away after using Reincarnation, as Reincarnation delay and Dagger cooldown are both 3 seconds.<br/><br/><br/><b>Late-game items:</b><br/>Desolator causes Wraith King's physical attacks to hit harder, especially against targets with already low armor as well as towers. With one or two lucky Mortal Strikes, Wraith King can quickly kill squishy carries and low-armor supports in the stun duration of Wraithfire Blast. Besides, it synergizes well with Assault Cuirass from the aspect of armor reduction; Vampiric Aura benefits greatly as the aura heals based on dealt damage after armor reduction.<br/><br/>Mjollnir increases attack speed and damage output. The item should be considered if Wraith King is counter picked by illusions, damage-over-time and slows, as the Chain Lightning and Static Shield are more likely to trigger against them. The item also accelerates his farm speed.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is a must-buy item most of the times for Wraith King in late game senarios. It increases his damage output by increasing the attack speed of his team and reducing enemies' armor, and single-handedly settles Wraith King's armor problem most of the time. The Assault Aura lasts longer thanks to Wraith King's high durability.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade allows Wraith King to stun an enemy for a total of 4 seconds on top of Wraithfire Blast. Meanwhile, the item gives him an edge in close combat due to the bash component. Though the HP bonus as well as damage block is at least moderately decent, the item is bought most of the time for its lock-down viability.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar increases Ostarion's attack damage, counters enemies with evasion abilities or items such as Butterfly or Heaven's Halberd, and provides him with a high chance to interrupt channeling spells when Wraithfire Blast is not an option.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is a very situational item against certain scenarios:<br/>Against heavy mana burn in mid-game, as it prevents Reincarnation from activating. Beware that the talent in level 25 allows Wraith King to reincarnate with 0 mana cost.<br/><br/>Being heavily kited/chain controlled even after buying Blink Dagger. Black King Bar allows Wraith King to dish out damage without the fear of being controlled. Nevertheless, Wraith King needs to position himself well and prevent himself from being kited even with Magic Immunity.<br/><br/><br/>Moon Shard is able to be consumed, granting him more attack speed and allowing him an effectively higher chance to proc Mortal Strike.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is well-suited for Ostarion to get due to it not dropping if Reincarnation activates upon death, thus making it less likely for him to lose it. When carrying the Aegis of the Immortal, Ostarion has to die 3 times to lose the Rapier. The great damage boost also increases his endurance by improving his lifesteal aura's returns.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Shadow Blade provides decent attack damage and attack speed boost. Shadow Walk is an alternative initiate item apart from Blink Dagger. It allows Wraith King to solo pick-off single enemies as well as initiate on long attack range heroes during team fight. However, the initiation advantage diminishes when pushing towers and highgrounds and walking around sentries.<br/><br/>Silver Edge reduces the cooldown, and adds a break effect as well as damage reduction effect on Shadow Walk.<br/><br/>Radiance adds a burn effect on Wraith King which constantly deals damage and a miss effect to nearby enemies. The effect of the item lasts longer on Wraith King because of Reincarnation and his high durability. The item also helps him farm faster and clears out creep waves.<br/><br/>Blade Mail provides decent armor and damage boost. If Wraith King is the primary target of the enemy, the active damage return discourages enemy from focusing him and helps Wraith King with damage output.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard offers immense survivability against magical damage as it provides extra armor and aura attack speed reduction. The active Arctic Blast helps slows enemies as well as dealing damage. This item is suitable if Wraith King is the main tank but not the main damage dealer in the team, and synergizes with Radiance due to the miss effect from Burn.<br/><br/>Butterfly gives Wraith King evasion, damage, and immense attack speed boost; the active Flutter allows Wraith King to chase enemy easier. The item is usually considered as the alternative of Assault Cuirass, as it trades aura and armor for evasion and attack speed. Note that Wraith King is a Strength hero and doesn't benefit from the agility boost that much compared with agility heroes.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives Ostarion a great health, health regeneration, and attack damage boost, making him even harder to kill and harder to ignore. It also provides enough HP regeneration to compensate the health drain from Armlet of Mordiggian .<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd gives Ostarion some evasion against enemies which rely on their physical attacks, and lets him cut off an enemy carry from their primary source of damage for a while.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is highly situational, as it allows Ostarion to potentially use Reincarnation twice in a fight allowing him to deal damage for a longer period of time.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness gives massive attack and movement speed, both of which Wraith King needs. The minus armor debuff is a trade-off at little cost thanks to Reincarnation. However, the lifesteal part doesn't help Wraith King that much due to Vampiric Aura.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter enables Wraith King to elongate his teammate's lives and allow teammates to unleash powerful ultimates or dishing out damage without fear of being focused down at first. While the item provides overall decent stats, it doesn't provide much damage output for Wraith King and should be considered situational.<br/><br/>Octarine Core reduces the reincarnation cooldown from 40 seconds to 30 seconds. The spell lifesteal benefits Wraith King if he went for Radiance. With Aghanim's Scepter, Reincarnation will be ready every 23 seconds combined with Wraith Form upgrade. Yet the intelligence boost is mostly wasted, and it doesn't provide much offensive capability and damage output for Wraith King.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Anti-Mage is one of the most mobile carries in the game, mostly well known for his ability to punish lineups heavily reliant on magic damage with Spell Shield giving him very high magic resistance and his Mana Void can be used to cause massive damage to heroes with huge mana pools. His Blink makes him one of the fastest farmers in the game, with the ability to jump from creep camp to creep camp and quickly clear them with few items. Anti-Mage is however incredibly reliant on items to unlock his true potential, having a very low strength gain and no way of locking down enemy heroes makes him a very vulnerable hero if he does not have enough farm.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely mobile and hard to catch.<br/><br/>High attack speed.<br/><br/>Scales well into late game.<br/><br/>Punishes heroes who rely on mana.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low Strength and Intelligence gain.<br/><br/>Reliant on Battle Fury to farm<br/><br/>Very reliant on farm to scale.<br/><br/>Needs a decent support in lane to get good farm.<br/><br/>Can be shut down in the early game.<br/><br/>Weak against gankers that disable if overextended.<br/><br/>Countered by heroes who aren't 100% dependent to mana, such as Huskar<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>You are utterly useless in team fights if you can't physically attack enemies. There are many ways to counter raw physical damage in DotA, especially if it's melee. Decent players will buy items like Scythe of Vyse, Blade Mail and Ghost Scepter to shut you down. Timing your entrance into the battle is everything for you.<br/><br/>Do not pick Anti-Mage if your team picks farmers such as Shadow Fiend, Enigma, or Tinker.<br/><br/>If you find yourself being killed quickly a Vitality Booster provides 250 health and can be later built into a Heart of Tarrasque. Generally, it is advisable to get a faster Manta Style.<br/><br/>A quick Battle Fury will greatly increase your farming ability which will greatly help later in the game.<br/><br/>Don't only farm the jungle. If the enemy is pushing Anti-Mage can push a different lane solo with a reliable escape mechanism with Blink and Town Portal Scroll and can indirectly defend by forcing the enemy to defend. It will require at least 1 core to respond to kill you generally giving your team a huge advantage if you TP back home to fight.<br/><br/>Be very wary of heroes like Shadow Demon, Dark Seer and Morphling, as illusions created from you carry the Mana Break spell as well, and combined with Anti-Mage's high Agility, could easily turn the tides of a teamfight.<br/><br/>Once you get full slotted you could opt to sell your Battle Fury for a different item, but its creep clearing abilities are still very useful and sometimes critical. You should sell it if you absolutely need another item that can turn the tides, such as a Monkey King Bar.<br/><br/>Many players are tempted to switch Power Treads to agility, but given your low strength gain (1.2), it may be better to keep them on strength if you are not jungling.<br/><br/>If under a lot of harass in lane, it can be worth it to get a Ring of Regeneration on top of your Ring of Health and later use that to build a Vladmir's Offering. Vlad's allows Anti-Mage to solo Roshan and also farm at full health while also being able to jungle ancients efficiently.<br/><br/>It can be a good idea to finish a hero with your ultimate, even if you could easily kill with an autoattack. Chances are a hero you focused is running low on mana and its team trying to save would come in close enough for your ultimate to hit quite a few enemies.<br/><br/>Even with Black King Bar, you should avoid being an initiator and instead bide your time until you can exploit a weak spot in the enemy's formation after a team fight starts, usually in the back lines where the supports are. This is especially important if the enemy carry is on the front lines with a BKB, which is a fight you will almost never win head on.<br/><br/>Even though you have poor strength gain, your starting strength and armor is actually very decent. Couple that with your naturally fast attack speed and a single point in mana break makes you very strong in trading hits.<br/><br/>With the above tip in mind against some common offlane heroes like Windranger and Mirana who try to harass you it's a good idea to constantly blink on them to trade hits as early as you're level 2, rather than simply withstanding harass. Setting the pace for the laning is critical to how fast you farm later in the game.<br/><br/>Your laning phase is an absolute nightmare. Many heroes can cripple your early game by harassing you and chasing you away. Also, if you don't utilize your laning phase the game may well end before you reach Anti-Mage's maximum potential. Ask your teammates to babysit you.<br/><br/>Anti-Mage has relatively low base health. If you can't kill an enemy quickly, it may be best to disengage, as an unfavorable fight can easily result in your own death.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Mana Break</h4>Mana Break is most effective against heroes with low mana pools, as you can completely deplete and disable them in less time. However, this also means that Mana Void will do significantly less damage when deployed as its damage is reliant on the mana pool's maximum size.<br/>Take note that heroes with small mana pool also potentially take much less damage from Mana Break since they are emptied so quickly, preventing the mana burn from further contributing to the Anti-Mage's potential damage.<br/><br/><br/>Manta Style is a commonly built item on Anti-Mage as your illusions can also apply Mana Break, tripling the ability's effectiveness. It also provides an increase to all attributes and a means to remove most disables, especially silences, that could prevent escaping via blink.<br/><br/>The damage from Mana Break is dealt as physical damage. As such, deliberately reducing your opponent's armour will increase the damage that Mana Break does.<br/><br/>Unlike most passive attack modifiers, Mana Break does not bypass spell immunity.<br/><h4>Blink</h4>Blink is the most common choice for your first ability point, as its immediate benefit is better than either of your passives. Put some points into Spell Shield if you are facing strong opponents or go for Mana Break if you want to be aggressive.<br/><br/>Never use Blink to start a fight unless you know you can win it. Doing so could leave you stranded in a bad situation.<br/><br/>Blink is a very versatile and powerful mobility tool. You can also use it to chase, maneuver, or to avoid spells during battles.<br/><br/>Relative to Anti-Mage's mana pool, Blink is somewhat costly in terms of mana. As such, you should refrain from freely employing the spell in the early stages of the game unless you have intelligence and mana boosting items to supplement your low base intelligence.<br/><h4>Spell Shield</h4>While Spell Shield provides substantial magic resistance, it is not a substitute for magic immunity as it does not block non-damage effects of enemy magic.<br/>Additionally, spells and abilities that deals physical and pure damage will completely bypass the bonus bestowed by Spell Shield<br/><br/><br/>Against an enemy lineup that consist of almost entirely physical damage dealers, Spell Shield can be considered as redundant and should be levelled up last in such a situation.<br/>Likewise, if you're against a spell and nuke heavy opposition, you may need to spend some early points in Spell Shield to negate and reduce some of the potential spell damage.<br/><br/><h4>Mana Void</h4>Mana Void is very difficult to use to full effect. Constantly check enemies with large mana pools. Use it on enemy casters after they have used their abilities and burned most of their mana. It can absolutely devastate an enemy team if used properly. Note that it does have a short stun, allowing you to cancel spell casts and channels.<br/><br/>Mana Void partially bypasses spell immunity as the damage is dealt in an area even if the primary target becomes spell immune, so while the main target will not take any damage, enemies around the radius will take full damage from the spell based on the mana loss of the primary target.<br/><br/>Mana Void will apply a mini-stun to the main target that pierces spell immunity. This can be used to disrupt channeling spells and abilities.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Tangoes help provide Anti-Mage with health regeneration in the early game.<br/><br/>Healing Salve will give Anti-Mage a massive boost of health regeneration.<br/><br/>Iron Branches will give Anti-Mage an additional attribute boost in the lane, and can be built into Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Stout Shield will allow Anti-Mage to take a few more hits from enemies when taking last hits in lane. Anti-Mage will often build this in a Poor Man's Shield.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give Anti-Mage a speed boost which can be helpful for getting around.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a good idea to pick up if the enemy is using a lot of spells since that gives Anti-Mage a lot of regeneration in case of emergency.<br/><br/>Ring of Health provides Anti-Mage with decent HP regeneration in the early game, and can later be built into a Battle Fury .<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Power Treads provide Anti-Mage with attack speed and attributes, allowing for a substantial increase in damage and durability.<br/><br/>Magic Wand provides Anti-Mage with more attributes and good HP and mana regeneration if the enemy is using a lot of spells.<br/><br/>Yasha provides agility and movement speed to Anti-Mage, and can be built into a Manta Style.<br/><br/>Battle Fury provides Anti-Mage with HP and mana regeneration, and gives Anti-Mage a cleave that allows Anti-Mage to farm faster and push faster.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is always a good idea to have on Anti-Mage at all times, as it allows Anti-Mage to easily escape from enemy ganks if Anti-Mage is out of position.<br/><br/>Manta Style provides attributes that benefit Anti-Mage very well. The illusions benefit from Mana Break, greatly improving Anti-Mage damage, pushing potential and mana-burning capabilities. Additionally, the split allows Anti-Mage to dodge and remove spell effects, which can be useful in combat or when escaping.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Abyssal Blade gives Anti-Mage a damage boost, a chance to stun enemies when attacking, and a guaranteed stun that goes through magic immunity. It also gives Anti-Mage a small amount of strength that will increase his health pool.<br/><br/>Butterfly offers a very substantial damage boost as Anti-Mage is an agility hero, it also gives Anti-Mage armor, evasion and additional attack speed on top of the attack speed gained from the agility on the item.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque increases the health pool of Anti-Mage massively, which gives Anti-Mage a lot more survivability.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is the only way for Anti-Mage to have lifesteal since Mana Break is a Unique Attack Modifier. The lifesteal and damage boost benefits both Anti-Mage and his teammates throughout the entire duration of the game.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi Gives Anti-Mage a big increase to survivability with health and armor, a passive late game slow that goes through magic immunity that works with Mana Break, and DPS increase with 25 agility.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Arc Warden is a carry that can nuke enemies early and then split push to end the game. His health, armor, and mana early on are fairly low, but they still give him enough to last in lane and nuke foes with his combo. His health and mana grow to respectable degrees later on, but his agility still suffers. His biggest detriments throughout the game are no mobility skills, needing to micromanage, and his abilities suffering vs multiple heroes. Nonetheless, a Warden who gets farmed is a foe to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Highest base strength and Intelligence of all agility heroes, and highest Intelligence growth.<br/><br/>Can easily nuke most enemies 1v1<br/><br/>Split Pushes extremely well with Tempest Double<br/><br/>One of the most versatile heroes in the game<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Second lowest base agility and agility gain of all agility heroes<br/><br/>0.1 base armor makes him susceptible to physical harassment early on.<br/><br/>Slow movement speed with no mobility skills makes it hard for him to escape if ganked.<br/><br/>Needs items to farm quickly, no ability outside of his ult helps him with farming.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Arc Warden is squishy early on with no escape tools. Pair him with a support if Safe Lane, or if heading mid make sure to keep wards up so you can see incoming ganks and know when it's time to fall back<br/><br/>Warden's abilities are strongest in a 1v1 situation. As such, placing him mid can see him easily dominate most other heroes there and gain a gold advantage.<br/><br/>Never skip Hand of Midas. Warden needs it to farm as he has no way to farm in his abilities, but he absolutely needs items. He also gains the hugest benefit out of it because his Tempest Double can use Midas with the gold and XP going to the main Warden.<br/><br/>Consumables like Healing Salve, Enchanted Mango, Clarity and Bottle cannot be copied by the Tempest Double.<br/><br/>Arc Warden can have potentially unlimited uses of Items with charges such as Drum of Endurance and Diffusal Blade if at least 1 charge is kept on the main Arc Warden, then only used on the Tempest Double, However, Black King Bar charges are used on both Arc Warden and his Tempest Double.<br/><br/>Items that place buffs or debuffs can have their duration doubled if timed right, as well as perhaps correcting any mistakes the main Arc Warden has made (such as targeting the wrong unit).<br/>Items that place buffs on allies, such as Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb, can be used on the main Arc Warden for increased protection and then using the main one's own to their allies, or vice versa.<br/><br/><br/>The Double can use teleport items such as Town Portal Scroll or Boots of Travel. This means while the main Arc Warden is somewhere else, farming, pushing or defending, the Double can be on the opposite side of the map contributing to a gank or farm the enemy jungle easily.<br/><br/>Using Hand of Midas with the Double grants the player the gold and 2.5x experience. The Double maintains the cooldown while it is unsummoned. This means that the double will not be able to use the item with every summon and Arc Warden must time the Double's summon to get the full benefits of the extra Midas.<br/>One Hand of Midas on the hero results in (190/100*60=)114 gold per minute if used whenever it is off cooldown. For the Tempest Double, the gold per minute is (190/100*60=) 114 gold per minute, resulting in 228 gold per minute for the player when both are always used when off cooldown, 2 times more than other heroes with one purchased Midas.<br/><br/><br/>It is wise to use the Double to farm or stack neutral camps if it has nothing else to do with its remaining duration for more efficiency and to gain more gold and experience.<br/><br/>It is very important to not allow an enemy Rubick to steal Tempest Double, since the ability fully works for Rubick. As Tempest Double is the only ability which the doubles have already on cooldown when summoned, this means Spell Steal is completely available to use for a Rubick Double, fully able to steal and cast a spell as the same way the original Rubick. Wisely managed and well timed, Rubick and its doubles can steal and cast important ultimates such as Black Hole or Reverse Polarity with ease.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Flux</h4>The ability only slows and damages if there's no enemy heroes, creeps, or jungle creeps within 225 range. However, if cast on an enemy near a tower or ward, they are still slowed and damaged.<br/><br/>Upon casting, the enemy always takes one damage instance, no matter if they're near another hero.<br/><br/>It deals damage every 0.5 seconds, resulting in 13 total damage ticks overall.<br/><br/>Applying Flux on an enemy first before summoning a Spark Wraith can make hitting the enemy with it easier.<br/><h4>Magnetic Field fully affects buildings, so it can and should be used to deter a push. Keep in mind that True Strike does not work against buildings, so even if the enemy obtains a Monkey King Bar, towers would still be fully protected with this spell.</h4>Spark Wraith<br/><br/>[edit | edit source]<br/><h4>Spark Wraith gives 300 vision at its area. Thus, it can be used as a pseudo ward for scouting for possible ganks.</h4>Tempest Double<br/><br/>[edit | edit source]<br/><h4>The Tempest Double essentially acts like an advanced version of an illusion. The main differences are: Tempest Double uses the current stats of Arc Warden, benefits from both stats and things like Point Booster that just add flat amounts. Only takes 100% damage as well. Deals 100% of Arc Warden's current damage including damage from items such as Daedalus, and gains the attack speed from items like Mjollnir. It also gains the passive attack speed from Moon Shard Can use abilities and items. They have their own, separate cooldowns on the Double. A few items, however, are not 100% usable by the Double. These include: Refresher Orb is always on cooldown for the Double Bloodstone does not apply the heal when the Double dies. Observer and Sentry Wards are not placeable by the Double. Divine Rapier isn't copied to the Double at all. Helm of the Dominator is usable by the Double. However, any units dominated by the Double are lost when it's resummoned. Consumables such as Healing Salves, Clarity, Enchanted Mango, Tango, Tango (Shared), and Bottle are not copied to the Tempest Double at all.</h4>Items<br/><br/>[edit | edit source]<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Slippers of Agility and a Circlet give the stats Arc Warden needs early on and can later be built into a Wraith Band.<br/><br/>Tango gives Arc Warden sustain in lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed improves Arc Warden's mediocre movement speed and gives him some form of escape from enemies.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila gives stats and a source of pushing at a cheap price. Remember to keep the aura turned off when you're not trying to push the lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Hand of Midas is essential on Warden as otherwise he could not farm at all. Keep track of its CD on Tempest Double to know when optimal times to call it are.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel gives Warden map wide presence for fighting, pushing, and farming.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is a good way to heal back up some health and some mana. It also makes use of the circlet and branches bought earlier and frees up inventory space.<br/><br/>Bottle is a great pick up on Arc Warden. As it helps with sustaining and manage runes.<br/><br/><br/>Maelstrom improves Warden's farming and pushing and can later build into Mjollnir.<br/><br/><br/>Dragon Lance provides useful stats for a highly cost effective price and the increased range allows Arc Warden to easily achieve good positioning to space himself from enemies from inside his Magnetic Field.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Phase Boots are an alternative to Travels if you need to fight early on, since improve his early game massively (movement speed & damage). These can later be sold for Travels anyway.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots should be the go to boots for a Support Warden. With Tempest Double, you can replenish 270 mana to heroes nearby, which can be enough to have them use a team fight changing ult.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows can give tons of healing if it's mainly Tempest Double using it, or even heal multiple allies at once.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance can effectively have infinite charges if usage of the charges is restricted to the Double only, or give a charge twice as long with both the Double and main hero using it after the current charge duration ends.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a great disable and immensely boosts Arc Warden's mana and mana regeneration, eliminating mana problems which may occur. The Hex duration can also be effectively doubled with the help of a Double.<br/><br/>Mjollnir buffs both yours and your Tempest Double's attack speed as well as punishing enemies who attack either.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade gives a purge, and it improves Warden's dreadful agility gain.<br/><br/>Desolator helps with both pushing towers and tearing down foes, all at an efficient price Warden can easily reach.<br/><br/>Black King Bar helps against disables or nukers if such are problems. It can also be used to send in the double in fights and staying back in safety with the main Arc Warden. The Double can use Avatar, but its duration is independent of the main Zet's Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Hurricane Pike is an alternative to Blink Dagger for a more offensive Warden. It lets him stay in the back with the increased range from it, and gives him an escape that, if used by Tempest Double as well, can effectively double the distance traveled.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is a luxury item on Warden that gives him all the stats he needs and a Black King Bar piercing slow.<br/><br/>Satanic is another luxury item that can be considered. It improves his rather frail nature and stacks fully with Eye of Skadi, but it does not stack with Desolator.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence into Bloodthorn gives Warden more utility and a huge dps increase with Bloodthorn's crit that works with anyone on the team, including the double. It gives true strike as well for those pesky heroes with evasion.<br/><br/>Dagon is great when focusing on picking off heroes. Dagon itself already does a lot of burst damage. Doubling that with a Tempest Double, combined with the rather high damage of Arc Warden's other spells, this item can help to deal with even very tanky foes. Throwing in an Ethereal Blade can turn Arc Warden into one of the strongest nukers.<br/><br/>Moon Shard makes Arc Warden attack extremely fast when combined with Magnetic Field. When consumed, the Tempest Double also gains the permanent buff.<br/><br/>Daedalus can be good on Arc Warden for the same reason why Butterfly can be: it turns him into a strong hitter in the later phases of the game. Although Daedalus is chance based, Zet can still constantly deliver crits thanks to the enormous attack speed boost provided by Magnetic Field. Butterfly should be acquired before a Daedalus, to first get some attack damage and more speed first, to make critical strikes more effective.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar is a great alternative to Daedalus when dealing with evasive enemies. Also thanks to its already high chance to interrupt an enemy with its mini-bash, it can even slow down an enemy heavily when attacking it with the Double as well, due to the amount of mini-bashes from 2 heroes attacking it with Monkey King Bar. The chances to quickly interrupt an enemy's channeling spells is very high.<br/><br/>Manta Style is a great item for pushes, as Arc Warden can have 4 illusions thanks to the Double. Just like with Necronomicon, the double's and the original's Manta Style are independent from and do not replace each other. The illusions also benefit from Magnetic Field, making them more resistance against physical attacks and speeding up their attack speed.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight should be considered over Mekansm on a support Warden, as you can apply the spell block twice in a fight, while you can only heal with Mek once every 35 seconds, rendering the second usage useless.<br/><br/>Butterfly can turn Arc Warden into a heavy hitter. His primary attribute is still agility, so he benefits a lot from its stats. The Tempest Double has no attack damage penalties like most illusions do, since it is not an illusion, so it can greatly increase Arc Warden's overall damage output. Arc Warden's 2 damaging spells deal both magical damage and do not scale. A Butterfly helps him keep on doing damage to the enemy in the late game. The attack damage he gets from the item is also great for pushing and synergizes very well with Magnetic Field.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is very effective on Arc Warden as well, again, thanks to his ultimate. He can have 2 sets of Necronomicon units up at the same time, since the units summoned by the double are independent and do not replace the units summoned by the main Zet. Necronomicon is an essential item for a pushing Arc Warden.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a cheap utility item for a support Warden that can keep a foe rooted for twice as long, or even root 2 people down so they can't escape as quickly.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard provides some protection against carries as it increases armor and slows their attacks passively. The active ability is also great for pushes. Although the aura does not stack when creating a Double, two Arctic Blasts also deal a decent amount of damage in fights.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bloodseeker is a snowballing carry who grows faster and stronger as his enemies get weaker. Like a shark in water, Bloodseeker detects injured enemies across the entire map and runs them down with unnatural speed through Thirst. His Rupture makes enemies bleed with every step, allowing him to gank targets with ease during the early game. Regaining health each time an enemy falls, Bloodseeker overwhelms enemy teams in fights, leaving little chance for turnarounds. However, Bloodseeker has no disables of his own, and must rely on his teammates to lock down targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Fast movement speed.<br/><br/>Regains health by killing enemies.<br/><br/>Good early ganker.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no disables.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to enemy disables.<br/><br/>Countered by tanks.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Bloodseeker should attempt to reach level six as soon as possible so he can start ganking with Rupture.<br/><br/>Because of the damage and speed bonus from Thirst, Bloodseeker players should always keep an eye on the enemy team's overall health, no matter where they are.<br/>An enemy team with low health means Bloodseeker has a significant advantage.<br/><br/><br/>Bloodseeker wins games by being aggressive and maintaining a kill advantage over the enemy team. Do not try to passively outfarm harder carries like Medusa or Spectre.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Bloodrage</h4>In lane, Bloodrage is especially good to use when your creeps have come under tower, not only making it easier to last hit but also replenishing your health.<br/><br/>Use Bloodrage on Bloodseeker to take down buildings quickly.<br/><br/>Use Bloodrage on an enemy with low damage, such as a tank or support, to help your team kill them quickly.<br/><br/>Use Bloodrage on an ally with AoE nuke abilities to greatly improve their damage output, and thereby increasing your bonus from Thirst.<br/><br/>Be careful when using Bloodrage on Bloodseeker when he is outnumbered, as the increased damage received can kill him very quickly.<br/><br/>If Bloodseeker is near death in a teamfight, kill low health enemies/creeps in order to replenish his health before returning to fight tougher enemies.<br/><br/>Use Bloodrage on enemies that are fleeing from a fight, this can make you and your team's chase more effective.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Blood Rite</h4>Use Blood Rite before closing in to attack. The silence will prevent enemies from disabling Bloodseeker.<br/><br/>Use Blood Rite when retreating to prevent enemies from disabling Bloodseeker and his allies. The damage done to enemies will also help him move faster.<br/><br/>Use Blood Rite after using Rupture to disable the target's abilities and prevent escape.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Thirst</h4>During the laning phase, put at least one point in Thirst to remove the movement speed cap and to receive bonus damage.<br/><br/>Thirst is usually maxed first because it helps Bloodseeker farm during the early game.<br/><br/>Attacking the enemy will cause subsequent attacks to hit harder, and damage dealt in other lanes will provide a further boost to your attack damage.<br/><br/>Each individual Meepo will add to the Thirst bonus stack.<br/><br/>Since Thirst reveals low HP heroes on the map, allies with global abilities, such as Invoker or Nature's Prophet will have a chance to finish them off.<br/>Ping the minimap to alert your team if you spot an enemy at low health. This is particularly effective in the early game against junglers, who rely on the safety of the trees to farm until their health is very low.<br/><br/><br/>Situationally, it can be good to leave low health enemies in a team fight that is in your team's favor in order to chase down more healthy enemies.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Rupture</h4>When ganking, it is sometimes best to save Rupture for when your target begins running away rather than using it to initiate the gank, as it will take no damage while standing still and fighting you.<br/><br/>Rupture deals pure damage, meaning it pierces spell immunity. Because of this, do not hesitate to use it enemy carries even if they have Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Rupture can be used with Force Staff to deal more damage.<br/><br/>Rupture works on most blinking heroes (a Queen of Pain could blink far enough to avoid taking damage).<br/><br/>Rupture is one of the best abilities for intercepting an enemy hero that is chasing you or your allies.<br/>Heroes with high mobility such as Anti-Mage, Lycan, Queen of Pain or Night Stalker suffer devastating damage when Ruptured.<br/><br/><br/>Some heroes have movement abilities that renders them invulnerable, and therefore do not trigger Rupture's HP loss. Using Rupture on these heroes can be wasteful.<br/>Storm Spirit with Ball Lightning<br/><br/>Faceless Void with Time Walk<br/><br/>Morphling with Waveform<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Stout Shield provides early protection from harassment and allow Bloodseeker to tank up creeps.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade is useful to quickly gain the health return from Bloodrage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Boots of Speed provide chasing power and the ability to escape in some situations, especially coupled with Bloodseeker's silence.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield helps counter incoming harassment. Coupled with the health return from Bloodrage, Bloodseeker can stay in lane indefinitely.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scrolls are particularly useful due to Bloodseeker's ability to spot a target anywhere on the map.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a cheap option for slowing enemies. The slows allows for setting up an effective Blood Rite.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Sange and Yasha is an all-round excellent item for hunting targets, as it gives Bloodseeker even more movement speed, and a chance to slow targets on attack with Maim.<br/><br/>Blade Mail prevents enemies from targeting Bloodseeker during teamfights.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Force Staff is used to push Ruptured enemies, and therefore deal more damage. It can also be use immediately after Rupture to disable Blink Daggers, or help Bloodseeker catch up to a fleeing foe.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is highly recommended against disablers. A Black King Bar makes Bloodseeker inescapable when Thirst is active.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse offers a powerful disable against enemy heroes and should not be ignored if your team lacks disables.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd provides health and evasion and an active to disable hard-hitters. When used in conjunction with Bloodrage on right-click heroes, it amplifies damage done to them, while preventing them from doing damage-amplified attacks. Foes can, however, cast damage-boosted spells, so heroes like Morphling with powerful nukes may not be prime targets for Bloodrage.<br/><br/>Dagon is sometimes picked up to deal high initial damage during ganks, thereby trigger Thirst's damage and speed bonuses to instantly give Bloodseeker the upper hand and finish off the target.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade gives decent stats, and can deal huge damage when combined with Dagon and the damage amplification from Bloodrage.<br/><br/>Dust of Appearance is crucial when ganking enemies with invisibility.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can be extremely helpful in ganking with Rupture.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is a natural upgrade from Shadow Blade, and is useful for breaking enemy passives as well as reducing their damage output.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering's lifesteal adds to Bloodseeker's health returning abilities.<br/><br/>Hand of Midas is sometimes bought if Bloodseeker has a good early game, or needs to match harder carries in the late game.<br/><br/>Butterfly provides much needed agility and attack speed as well as evasion. The active ability can also be used in conjunction with Thirst to catch up to an enemy if needed.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is commonly built to deal area damage, and therefore increase Thirst's bonuses more quickly.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar may be useful in some situations for its minibash to prevent channeled escape spells and its True Strike that renders enemy evasion null (important against abilities such as Windrun, Smoke Screen or Blur).<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives you movement speed and mana regeneration which Bloodseeker needs as well as a way to stop enemies from teleporting away.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is always a useful item and a strong Bloodseeker can gain much staying power from it.<br/><br/>Radiance's area damage automatically increases Thirst's bonuses, and is especially useful for teamfights and chasing down enemies. The burn damage is also amplified per second by Bloodrage.<br/><br/>Skull Basher gives Bloodseeker a much needed disable, and prevents enemies from simply teleporting away from his ganks.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter allows Bloodseeker to cast Rupture twice, and also gives him some nice attributes and stats.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bounty Hunter is a strong utility support hero who helps his team by picking off the enemy one by one, increasing gold gain for his team and giving them opportunities to take map objectives while they outnumber the enemy. However, he is also very vulnerable since his low strength means that he can be easily killed if the enemy catches him while he approaches a target, particularly due to his reliance on Shadow Walk. As such, good judgment and map awareness are key when playing Bounty Hunter, as he must be able to successfully initiate on and kill his targets without the enemy retaliating.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage.<br/><br/>Invisibility.<br/><br/>Can counter other invisible heroes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very squishy.<br/><br/>Mana-dependent.<br/><br/>Weak team fight presence.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One small advantage that Bounty Hunter possesses over other heroes is that he has 1000 night vision instead of the standard 800. This makes Bounty Hunter a powerful night hunter, as he can spot targets at night who cannot see him, and cast Track on them from the Fog of War.<br/><br/>In general, it is wise to check the enemy's inventory any time they appear on the map, and be aware of all enemy players' positions on the map. Knowing if the enemy may place Sentry Wards to give warning of your approach, as well as if they have Dust of Appearance or Gem of True Sight, can save your life as you can prevent yourself from walking into a trap. Additionally, knowing that certain enemies are on another part of the map will allow you to kill your target in the knowledge that their allies cannot reach them in time.<br/><br/>When playing Bounty Hunter, it is important to stay off the map as much as possible once the laning stage ends. Keep the enemy guessing on where you are, so that they second-guess their decision to farm their own jungle, or push a lane too far forward, or go to any part of the map by themselves, for fear of being found and killed by you and your teammates. By doing so, you can destroy the enemy's economy as they will be too preoccupied worrying about you and not be spending time farming, giving your team space to out-farm them and get a strong gold and level advantage.<br/><br/>Bounty Hunter is best played as an off-laner or roamer.<br/><br/>As an off-laner, Bounty Hunter should attempt to block the enemy's pull camp so that he can get last-hits closer to his tower, and use Shadow Walk to sap experience if needed. As well, using an Observer Ward to block the enemy's pull camp can, depending on the ward's specific location, alert you to any incoming rotations by the enemy's supports, or let you see if the enemy is ferrying detection items to themselves with their courier in order to counter Shadow Walk.<br/><br/>As a roamer, Bounty Hunter should generally focus on helping out in ganks by using Shadow Walk to approach an enemy who gets out of position during laning, adding his damage output to gank attempts. While he lacks contribution besides his right-clicks and body-blocking at level 1, once he has a level or two he can add his skills to the mix.<br/><br/>Early play with Bounty Hunter can allow him to snipe the enemy's courier from invisibility, under optimal circumstances. As he can wait for the enemy's courier invisibly with Shadow Walk, he can choose to kill it as it approaches the enemy's mid to deliver their Bottle, or snipe it as it tries to ferry detection items to their safe lane supports. However, it requires good game sense and map awareness to know where the courier might appear, so this tactic is only viable at higher levels of gameplay.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shuriken Toss</h4>Shuriken Toss is a ranged damage nuke that mini-stuns its target upon impact. It will also bounce between enemies that have been affected by Track.<br/>As it is Bounty Hunter's only ranged nuke, maxing Shuriken Toss as his first spell increases his nuking power and allows him to more easily finish off enemies during ganks. The nuking power is strongest in the early game when HP pools are small and all heroes are more vulnerable to magic nukes.<br/><br/>Remember that Shuriken Toss mini-stuns the target upon impact, so it is better to hold it in reserve until the enemy uses a channeling spell or activates their Town Portal Scroll. While it does have a short cooldown, the channeling time on a Town Portal Scroll is even shorter.<br/><br/>When using Shuriken Toss alongside Track to inflict damage to multiple enemy heroes in a teamfight, remember that the initial target does not have to be affected by Track in order for it to bounce. This allows Bounty Hunter to throw the shuriken at an un-Tracked target and it will bounce to any Tracked heroes within range. Using this tactic can be useful for increasing your damage output if you do not have time to cast Track on all enemy heroes before using the shuriken, or for increasing the shuriken's maximum range to 1600 by tossing it at a creep and closing the remainder of the distance from the bounce.<br/><br/>Be careful about approaching targets to cast Shuriken Toss on them, as its short cast range may put you in unnecessary danger. If possible, try to Track the target first, and use a nearby creep as a target to bounce the shuriken from a safer range. Remember that you can also use the bounce to catch a fleeing enemy hero who would otherwise be outside of its 400 cast range.<br/><br/><h4>Jinada</h4>Jinada is a powerful damage ability that gives Bounty Hunter the ability to inflict critical strikes at will.<br/>Due to its scaling, Jinada is best to max out last among Bounty Hunter's skills, as its damage output is minimal in the early game before Bounty Hunter has enough gold to purchase damage items to boost its power. However, it is also wise to take a single value point in the laning stage due to the slow it inflicts on its target.<br/><br/>Because Jinada's crit is guaranteed every time it is off cooldown but cannot proc otherwise, its effectiveness increases with more damage but not attack speed. Bounty Hunter is best served building raw damage items, as attack speed does not help Jinada to proc more frequently.<br/><br/>Jinada's slow is a powerful disabling ability, particularly when combined with the guaranteed critical strike and augmented with the surprise of Shadow Walk. Using both abilities in tandem during a gank can deal a large amount of damage to a target and then slow them for allies to close in.<br/><br/>When going for the level 25 Talent that reduces Jinada's cooldown to 1 second, with the right amount of Attack Speed a crit every two hits is guaranteed. The total Attack speed value where this stops working (and you get a crit only every 3 hits) lies approximately around 270.<br/><br/><h4>Shadow Walk</h4>Shadow Walk is an invisibility spell that renders Bounty Hunter invisible until he attacks, casts a spell, uses an item or the duration expires.<br/>Shadow Walk is Bounty Hunter's go-to spell for mobility, escape and initiations, and as such it should generally be leveled first. At level 1, it provides 20 seconds of invisibility on a 15 second cooldown, allowing Bounty Hunter to remain invisible so long as he as the mana to back it up.<br/><br/>As Shadow Walk applies the bonus damage buff right at the start of the spell, it is possible to attack a target during the fade time and still inflict the bonus damage while retaining the buff. This can help with last hitting or harassing as you will be able to use the bonus damage twice (once during the fade time and once when breaking invisibility), however it becomes less feasible as the spell is leveled due to the fade time shortening.<br/><br/>Shadow Walk has an instant cast time, and does not interrupt channeling. As such, it can be cast without breaking your stride while escaping, and can be activated after beginning to channel a Town Portal Scroll, whether the aim is to become invisible while escaping or to become invisible prior to reaching your destination.<br/><br/>Be wary that using items will break Shadow Walk. Therefore, actions such as changing attributes on Power Treads or activating the movement speed boost of Phase Boots will break invisibility, so be extremely careful about item usage while under the effects of Shadow Walk. Conversely though, if you have been affected by Dust of Appearance you can instantly break invisibility using the above two methods in order to negate the slow that it inflicts on invisible heroes.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Shadow Walk's duration is always longer than its cooldown. At higher levels, it is possible to strike a target out of invisibility, become invisible again immediately afterward, and then hit them again for large amounts of bonus damage. However, this also leaves Bounty Hunter vulnerable since he will be visible and with Shadow Walk on cooldown, making escaping difficult if the enemy finds him before he can turn invisible again.<br/><br/><h4>Track</h4>Track is a powerful intelligence spell in any situation, and is a great boon to any team. As it provides True Sight on the target, as well as increasing the movement speed of all nearby allies, it is extremely powerful in preventing the enemy from easily initiating and giving them a mobility advantage during teamfights.<br/>Track is an extremely powerful ability against heroes that rely on invisibility to escape, as the True Sight reveals their location through invisibility. It is also very powerful against heroes with blink abilities, as they often rely not only on quickly putting distance between themselves and their pursuers, but also on jumping in an unknown direction to make their opponents guess.<br/><br/>While Bounty Hunter excels at killing lone targets by himself, his team is better served in assisting him whenever he ganks targets. This not only increases the chances of a successful kill, but awards bonus reliable gold to nearby allies. The allied bonus gold exists for a reason, and rewards a team that coordinates kills with Bounty Hunter rather than letting him try to kill enemies by himself.<br/><br/>In a teamfight, try to cast Track on as many enemies as possible first, as it will give all teammates a movement speed advantage and mark them all as potential targets for a bounced Shuriken Toss. Any successful kills will greatly increase the gold bounty received, which can lead to buying more core items faster. However, when ganking a solo target, it is generally advisable to reserve Track until after you initiate on the target with a Shadow Walk and Jinada combo, in order to avoid alerting them until the last possible second.<br/><br/>In general, it is wise to Track as many enemy heroes as possible in order to gather intelligence on their locations and movement. This gives your team a powerful strategic advantage since they will not only know the location of the Tracked targets and benefit from the movement speed bonus over a wider area, but may also give warning of other enemies casting certain spells (such as Moonlight Shadow).<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Track allows you to discern how much gold the target has, which lets you know how close they may be to getting one of their core items. After tracking an enemy (especially one of their core heroes), be sure to alert teammates to the debuff (Alt + left click on the debuff in the enemy player's status bar). This also serves to log the event in the chat log for later reference. This allows your team to make the decision based on the amount of farm the enemy has: if they are close to getting another major item, quickly rotating and ganking the target can set them back tremendously, however if they are farming poorly you can choose to engage a different enemy or take the time to continue farming on your side.<br/><br/>Since Track has such a low cooldown, it is a very good ability to use in order to break an enemy's Linken's Sphere, whether in a teamfight or during a gank. In teamfights, it can render their Linken's Sphere useless ahead of time, and in ganks it can be used as a leader prior to a stronger targeted disable.<br/><br/>It is important to note that if Bounty Hunter is in the enemy's Fog of War and casts Track on an enemy, his position is not revealed to them, thereby allowing him to stealthily mark targets for his team. However, the debuff status indicator still appears in enemy players' HUDs, and the movement speed bonus is easily visible on all nearby creeps. Regardless, it is a useful feature in that it allows Bounty Hunter to Track targets without revealing his location.<br/><br/><br/>Given his role, Bounty Hunter has a myriad of items he can build to assist in getting kills against targets.<br/>As an off-laner, it is wise to request your team's supports to buy you an Observer Ward to give you vision in the enemy's jungle and possibly block their pull camp (although do not be afraid to buy one for yourself if you must move immediately to lane upon connecting to battle). Doing so will alert you to any incoming rotations and ganks so that you can keep alive. Once past the laning stage you are encouraged to regularly buy Observer Wards yourself, as you can traverse the map with Shadow Walk and place them for your team, giving you map vision to spot potential ganks.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>One each of Tango and Healing Salve are basic regen requirements that can keep Bounty Hunter in-lane despite enemy harass.<br/><br/>Clarity is useful for allowing Bounty Hunter to maintain casting his spells, as his base mana pool is quite small and Shadow Walk costs little mana to cast.<br/><br/>Remaining inventory space should be filled with Iron Branches, as they provide stats that improve survivability. Given the cost of above items, enough gold is usually left over for one.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Stout Shield provides damage block to counter physical harassment, and is effectively mandatory when playing in the off-lane.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are important for survival as an off-laner, and important for getting in position for ganks as a roamer. Buy them as early as possible.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a powerful early-game complement to Jinada, as the combination of slows can reduce a target's movement speed by up to 45%.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield gives Bounty Hunter additional armor and base damage, on top of a reliable damage block against hero harass.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good item to get on Bounty Hunter once he begins roaming, as it firms up his HP pool and gives him some mana regen. Getting successful ganks off will get charges that can be used either to add Pure damage in further ganks or to heal in between ganks.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is highly recommended on Bounty Hunter, as his small HP pool makes it disparately effective on him and his spells have low cooldowns (and a high mana cost, in the case of Shuriken Toss). A full charge Magic Stick can replenish a large fraction of Bounty Hunter's health, and give him enough mana to cast multiple spells. Magic Wand is powerful for all the same reasons, giving Bounty Hunter additional stats as well as larger charge storage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots give Bounty Hunter increased mobility, and the bonus damage synergizes best with Jinada. Be careful when using the active, as doing so will break Shadow Walk invisibility.<br/><br/>Bottle is very effective on Bounty Hunter both as an off-laner and roamer. The low mana cost of his spells and his small HP pool mean that he gets a lot of benefits from the regen, and his mobility with Shadow Walk allows him to bottle runes as needed.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives comprehensive attribute bonuses as well as increasing Bounty Hunter and his allies' movement speed, important for getting ganks off. Activating it during a gank or fight can give teammates a tremendous movement speed boost that stacks with that of Track, giving your allies a decisive edge in mobility.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence greatly increases the size of Bounty Hunter's mana pool, as well as giving him powerful mana regen to let him sustain without having to return to the fountain as often. The silence is a powerful ganking tool, as it prevents foes from retaliating during a gank and can help ensure a kill due to the damage amplification at the end of the silence.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Monkey King Bar drastically increases Bounty Hunter's initiating power, as the increased damage can deal tremendous damage when combined with Jinada. The True Strike prevents missing from blind and evasion, and the Mini-Bash gives a chance to interrupt channeling spells without immediately resorting to Shuriken Toss.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering allows Bounty Hunter to lifesteal, giving him a measure of sustainability by attacking creeps. The basic mana and health regen it provides makes him a more independent roamer, and the bonus damage and armor improve his offensive and defensive capabilities. Beware purchasing this item when initiating on foes in-lane though, as the lifesteal aura may give away your position.<br/><br/>Butterfly gives Bounty Hunter increased damage and attack speed, and the evasion gives him survivability against physical attacks. As well, the active can be used to improve mobility while roaming, at the cost of the evasion.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere protects Bounty Hunter from targeted spells, on top of the stat and regen improvement. Blocking an enemy from targeting you with a disable or debuff can drastically improve Bounty Hunter's survivability when evading enemy ganks, and can increase the chances of successful ganks by preventing the enemy from counter-disabling you.<br/><br/>Black King Bar gives Bounty Hunter a way to contribute directly in teamfights, as he can fight the enemy without worrying about being disabled by their spells. The stats increase his HP pool and damage output as well.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a useful mid-game utility item that increases Bounty Hunter's damage output. The armor gives him more survivability while the mana regen allows him to sustain his mana pool somewhat, and the active can be used shortly after initiation to increase a target's vulnerability to physical damage.<br/><br/>Desolator is a powerful initiating item as it drastically increases the damage taken from attacking a target out of Shadow Walk with Jinada. The armor reduction helps allies to add their damage in a gank, ensuring a swift kill.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius can be a useful laning item to build, as Bounty Hunter's spells cost very little mana and his base intelligence is somewhat low. The additional armor and damage also help him to survive, and it can be disassembled later and the Sage's Mask recycled for another item, since Bounty Hunter's intelligence growth makes the Sage's Mask better for mana regen once he hits level 6.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger greatly extends Bounty Hunter's already strong mobility, as he can chase and escape over impassable terrain, especially when combined with Track. It can be used in conjunction with Shadow Walk to allow for powerful initiations and chasing, preventing targets from running away under even the best of circumstances.<br/><br/>Aether Lens can be a powerful utility item that aids Bounty Hunter's spell casting. It boosts the size of his mana pool, as well as providing HP regen for increased survivability. The increased cast range and spell damage amplification on Shuriken Toss and Track can allow Bounty Hunter to cast his spells from safer range and in some cases can allow him to more easily secure kills.<br/><br/>Solar Crest can be upgraded from a purchased Medallion of Courage, and tremendously improves Bounty Hunter's survivability against physical attacks as well as giving him increased mana regen. Using the active on a gank target reduces their armor by a tremendous amount, and reduces their ability to fight back due to the induced miss chance.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel give Bounty Hunter more mobility, along with freeing up inventory space due to not needing a Town Portal Scroll anymore. As such, more powerful damage or initiating items can be built, and targets can be chased more easily, as well as the global repositioning giving Bounty Hunter far more opportunities to execute ganks due to being able to teleport to allied creeps instead of just towers.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves is useful if you are playing Bounty Hunter support, the active replenishes health and mana to all your team and you, remove debuffs from you like some silences, and the guardian aura its strong during teamfights, it can be farmed fast with Track kills.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very strong utility item that greatly improves Bounty Hunter's disabling potential. Besides giving him all-around stats and greatly boosting his intelligence and mana regen, the Hex is an extremely powerful hard disable that can instantly disable a target from range.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade is a very expensive item, not only increasing Bounty Hunter's survivability by a lot. While the passive bash is better used on a hero with enough attack speed to proc the stun reliably, Abyssal Blade is an exception for Bounty Hunter since he can use the active to instantly stun a gank target, and disable targets through spell immunity as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Broodmother is hero made to pressure the lanes early. While she excels at split-pushing the lanes and taking towers with her army of spiderlings, she cannot carry the game by herself and normally needs to coordinate with her team to finish the game in a timely manner.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong split-pusher.<br/><br/>Very strong kill potential early game.<br/><br/>Can farm enemy jungle.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Predictable play style due to lack of global presence.<br/><br/>Damage scales off late game.<br/><br/>Often forces own team to play 4 vs 5.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Broodmother is usually played alone in the offlane, as the invisibility and regeneration from her webs allow her to face off against multiple opponents.<br/><br/>Broodmother is arguably the best early lane pusher in the game. A good player must take advantage of this.<br/><br/>An aggressive Broodmother can often take down a tier two tower while other players are still farming.<br/><br/>Beware of enemy Sentry Wards in lane. It is often worth it to buy your own Sentry Wards to detect and destroy the enemy wards.<br/><br/>Remember that you can use Tangos, or a Quelling Blade to take out Sentry Wards quickly.<br/><br/>Broodmother is very effective against solitary targets, but against multiple enemies she suffers; as her lifesteal can generally only replenish the damage taken from a solitary foe.<br/><br/>Broodmother's primary escape mechanism is to move into her webs onto impassable terrain when attacked.<br/><br/>Although Broodmother is usually pushing lanes alone, she is still sometimes needed in teamfights. It is important when playing her to know the right time to push, and when to team fight.<br/><br/>Though Broodmother excels in the hard lane, she can also control and farm parts of the enemy jungle.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Spawn Spiderlings</h4>A Soul Ring is usually needed to use Spawn Spiderlings frequently.<br/><br/>Spawn spiderlings acts as a ranged nuke, and is very useful for killing weak enemies that are fleeing.<br/><br/>As a group, spiderlings deal a surprising amount of damage, especially in the early game. Use them to harass opponents in lane.<br/><br/>Send out spiderlings to scout, block creep camps, and keep an eye on Roshan.<br/><br/>Even though spiderlings give little gold, constantly feeding groups of them will benefit the enemy team.<br/><br/>Spiderlings can spawn Spiderites by denying allied creeps.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Spin Web</h4>Use Spin Web on top of an enemy tower before diving in on weak heroes. The regeneration and move speed bonus combined with Broodmother's slow is very effective for diving on heroes with no reliable escape or stun.<br/><br/>Use Spin Web over trees and high ground to give Broodmother escape paths.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Incapacitating Bite</h4>Incapacitating Bite is not a unique attack modifier and stacks fully with Orb of Venom and Eye of Skadi and also with Poison Sting making it almost impossible for your enemies to escape on foot.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Insatiable Hunger</h4>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango provide needed health regeneration during the laning phase.<br/><br/>Healing Salve keeps Broodmother in lane.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection gives extra armor and can be built into a Ring of Basilius from the side-shop.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Soul Ring allows her to use Spawn Spiderlings to harass the lane rival and safely take last hits.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius provides attribute bonuses as well as an armor aura for extra pushing power and can be upgraded into Vladmir's Offering later on.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads provide attack speed and more survivability through additional attribute bonuses.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence's silence allows Broodmother to kill heroes with escape abilities and/or stuns.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering provides a useful lifesteal effect on both Broodmother and nearby spiderlings, fully stacking with the effects of her ultimate ability. The bonus armor and attack damage greatly increase the ability of Broodmother and her spiders to push lanes and towers.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Hand of Midas should be picked up if Broodmother had a good early game. It increases her experience greatly, especially with the level 10 talent.<br/><br/>Black King Bar's magic immunity synergies with the huge lifesteal from Insatiable Hunger and makes her very hard to kill.<br/><br/>Desolator gives excellent damage and an armor reduction debuff increasing Broodmother's push and farm speed.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass boosts the attack speed and armor of Broodmother and her spiders, while also reducing the armor of nearby towers, allowing her to push faster.<br/><br/>Manta Style offers bonus attack speed, damage, movement speed and stats. The active ability, Mirror Image, can be used to dispel debuffs such as Dust of Appearance, dodge stunning projectiles such as Storm Hammer, or to increase Broodmother's ability to push lanes and towers.<br/><br/>Butterfly offers bonus attack speed, damage and armor, increasing Broodmother's carry potential. The only downside is that the enemy most likely purchases Monkey King Bar on their carries to counter you anyway, making the evasion of Butterfly less useful.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar can be bought to dominate enemies with evasion. Another choice can be upgrade Orchid Malevolence to Bloodthorn.<br/><br/>Radiance provides useful area damage that Broodmother can easily apply while invisible and/or unreachable both to push lanes faster and to harass incautious enemy heroes.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Clinkz is a great all around ranged carry with high offensive burst damage. Though frail and easy to kill, Skeleton Walk grants Clinkz stealth and haste to escape and re-position himself. This skill is also what makes Clinkz such an incredible ganker. His Searing Arrows provide huge bonus damage, greatly injuring enemies in conjunction with Strafe. Despite his high damage, Clinkz has no disabling abilities, and has difficulty killing enemies once they move out of range.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Invisible ganker.<br/><br/>Very high attack damage.<br/><br/>Destroys buildings quickly.<br/><br/>High movement speed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very fragile.<br/><br/>Item dependent.<br/><br/>Slow attack animation.<br/><br/>Easily countered by true sight.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Clinkz has one of the slowest attack animations in the game. Time his attacks carefully to get last hits.<br/><br/>Clinkz relies on successful early to mid game ganks to be effective.<br/><br/>The simplest way to gank is to go invisible with Skeleton Walk, position Clinkz behind an enemy, then activate Strafe before attacking to land as many arrows as possible.<br/>This is made easier with an Orchid Malevolence, which prevents enemies from using a disable or escape ability.<br/><br/>Enemies farming in the jungle are prime targets for Clinkz to gank with this tactic.<br/><br/>The worst case scenario is for the target to simple move out of range before Clinkz lands enough arrows. Position Clinkz close to the target or wait until the target is distracted before breaking invisibility.<br/><br/><br/>While he can be an excellent ganker, Clinkz is extremely fragile and puts out huge amounts of DPS, making him a priority target in teamfights. Try to let teammates initiate while you dance around the edge of the fight dealing damage to distracted or disabled opponents.<br/><br/>If you are focusing on early game ganking, level Strafe as your second ability to max as the decreased cooldown makes you a great threat.<br/><br/>If you are playing as the team's late game carry, maxing Skeleton Walk keeps Clinkz safe and able to move quickly into untaken lanes and the jungle to farm.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Strafe</h4>Strafe's attack speed bonus is constant at all levels, so one point is enough for the early game.<br/><br/>Strafe's short duration and long cooldown during the early game means it should be used very carefully.<br/><br/>Combined with Searing Arrows, Strafe can deplete Clinkz's mana very quickly during the early game. Make sure to retain enough for Skeleton Walk in case you need to escape from failed gank attempts.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Searing Arrows</h4>Searing Arrows is usually leveled first because its high damage helps Clinkz score last hits.<br/><br/>During the early game, a few Searing Arrows will do enough damage to harass opponents out of lane. Cast it manually (orbwalking) to avoid drawing aggro.<br/>However, Clinkz should still prioritize on getting last hits for himself.<br/><br/><br/>Searing Arrows can be quite mana intensive in the early game. An Orchid Malevolence is usually purchased to offset its mana needs.<br/><br/>Searing Arrow's high damage will take down buildings very quickly. Coupled with Skeleton Walk, it allows Clinkz to push lanes efficiently.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Skeleton Walk</h4>Use Skeleton Walk a good amount of time before you expect to ambush an enemy, or appear in a fight. This triggers the cooldown early, therefore allowing you it again soon after, either for a quick escape or to chase down any survivors.<br/><br/>Use Skeleton Walk before crossing commonly warded spots, such as the river, to avoid being seen coming.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Death Pact</h4>Death Pact's bonuses depends on the creep it sacrifices. The higher the creep's health, the higher the bonuses Clinkz gains.<br/>Always try to use Death Pact on the biggest creep possible, such as the Satyr Tormenter and Centaur Conqueror.<br/><br/>Devouring one of these creeps gives Clinkz 550/715/880 bonus health as well as 55/71.5/88 bonus base damage.<br/><br/>Siege creeps are also acceptable if there is no time to enter the jungle.<br/><br/><br/>In the late game, Clinkz could devour Mega Melee Creeps that have (static) 1270 HP, thus giving him 635/825.5/1016 bonus health and 63.5/82.6/101.6 bonus base damage.<br/><br/>Use Death Pact before an impending fight to make sure Clinkz has enough durability and damage.<br/><br/>Death Pact cannot sacrifice ancient creeps.<br/><br/>Death Pact's low cooldown means that Clinkz should be using it as often as possible.<br/><br/>Use Death Pact to deny and enemy jungler some farm. Taking the largest creep while leaving the smaller ones will prevent the camp from respawning.<br/><br/>Death Pact instantly kills dominated or controlled units, such as those used by Chen or Enchantress, and units from Necronomicon.<br/><br/>Use Helm of the Dominator to increases creep's health.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango give Clinkz the basic health regeneration to stay longer in lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Clinkz at the very last second in an emergency.<br/><br/>Clarity is very important since you need to dominate the lane by harassing your enemies with Searing Arrows' hits, you need to refill your small mana pool in the first 5 min of the match.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Ring of Aquila gives improved damage and mana regeneration, allowing better use of Searing Arrows.<br/><br/>Magic Wand helps against enemies that can spam spells.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can solve Clinkz's mana problems, if cast before using Death Pact it effectively costs 0 HP, and allows Death Pact to be used on cooldown.<br/><br/>Blight Stone will help you for very early ganks or pushes, or simply to harass an enemy even further. It will later upgrade into a Desolator or, at a cheaper cost, a Medallion of Courage that also provides some much needed mana regen. It's not unheard of to get both these items. You can therefore get an early Blight Stone, finish a Medallion and immediately get a second Blight Stone. One good thing is that all these components can be purchased from the Side shop.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads help you attack faster to improve the effectiveness of Searing Arrows.<br/><br/>Desolator stacks with Searing Arrows, which adds more killing capabilities, and dispose heroes with low health pool quickly.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar improves Clinkz's damage per second and gives a passive mini-stun which can cancel channeling spells such as Town Portal Scroll.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Orchid Malevolence solves Clinkz's mana problems associated with using Searing Arrows and allows you to silence heroes. This allows Clinkz to gank more effectively and disable enemies abilities in fights. Can be upgraded to Bloodthorn, which is very good late game item for Clinkz.<br/><br/>Daedalus greatly increases Clinkz's DPS because, when combined with Strafe, he does roughly 2 attacks per second with the skill active. Combined with Power Treads and Orchid Malevolence it makes it much more likely to crit multiple times in a short period.<br/><br/>Butterfly provides a massive agility and attack speed bonus as well as evasion.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade can be useful if the enemy team has multiple Ghost Scepters or Ethereal Blades. With fast reflexes, it can also be used to purge the active from Glimmer Cape.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger can help Clinkz snowball very hard, as it makes Clinkz difficult to catch. Also you may consider buying it in difficult game situations where split pushing is a key factor for victory.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi stacks with Searing Arrows, which allows you to chase down heroes whilst improving all your stats.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is an alternative to Orchid Malevolence that offers less dps but provides a stronger disable.<br/><br/>Black King Bar should be built in most situations to counter enemy stuns, silences, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Drow Ranger is a deadly archer, chilling and killing her enemies with volleys of Frost Arrows. With one of the highest agility stats in the game, her powerful shots will tear through most enemies from a safe distance. Her Precision Aura increases the damage of her ranged allies, and a timely Gust can silence groups of enemies at pivotal moments. Drow Ranger is fairly fragile with no real escape ability, causing her to struggle against faster and more aggressive melee heroes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High single target damage.<br/><br/>Powerful early pusher.<br/><br/>Good chaser.<br/><br/>Buffs other ranged heroes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly stat dependent.<br/><br/>No escape mechanism.<br/><br/>Fragile and easily ganked.<br/><br/>Slow attack animation.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Drow Ranger is usually played in the safe lane, with a support.<br/><br/>Drow Ranger is easily ganked. Make sure not to overextend if your support is not nearby.<br/><br/>Drow Ranger is all about positioning, since her Marksmanship bonus is disabled if an enemy closes to within 400 range.<br/>Stay behind your teammates and use them as a buffer. Reposition throughout fights to keep your tankier teammates between you and the enemy.<br/><br/>Approach fights from the edges, and rely on the slow from Frost Arrows instead of physical proximity to keep enemies in range.<br/><br/>Any item that helps Drow Ranger keep her distance is good, such as Dragon Lance, Shadow Blade, Blink Dagger and Force Staff.<br/><br/>Like other ranged heroes, stutter stepping is useful for Drow Ranger, but not as important due to the slow from Frost Arrows.<br/><br/><br/>Because of her passive abilities, Drow Ranger is slightly less dependent on items than other carries, but can still be shut down in the early game. Be careful not to take any needless risks.<br/><br/>Drow Ranger deals high damage to buildings, and should always capitalize on any opportunity to take down a tower.<br/><br/>Due to her slow attack animation, Drow Ranger should not do anything except farm until at least level six, when her first point in Marksmanship will make her attack much faster.<br/><br/>If you are having trouble timing last hits, try moving closer to the creep wave.<br/><br/>Animation cancelling with the Stop hotkey (S by default) can also help with timing.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Frost Arrows</h4>With level four Frost Arrows, Drow Ranger can kite most melee heroes.<br/><h4>Gust</h4>Gust is Drow Ranger's only means of defense, and should not be used lightly.<br/><br/>Use Gust defensively to push enemies who get too close, keeping them beyond the 400 Marksmanship bonus range.<br/><br/>Use Gust offensively to interrupt enemies who try to react to your attacks with a disable or an escape ability.<br/><br/>With Blink Dagger, Drow Ranger can use Gust to initiate on and gank single targets.<br/><br/>If an enemy is already hit by a long disable (such as cyclone or Disruption), Drow Ranger can move to the opposite side of her target, and push them backwards with Gust right after the first disable ends.<br/><br/>In a teamfight, try to catch as many enemies with Gust as possible, preferably as a follow up to your team's initiator. This will shut down the enemy for several seconds, during which Drow Ranger can pick off one or two targets.<br/><br/>Use Gust on an enemy team in the Roshan Pit to push them further inside, and render them unable to respond.<br/><br/>With good timing, it is possible to push enemies onto different elevations like cliffs.<br/><br/>With a Shadow Blade, Drow Ranger can gank by taking a shot to break the invisibility, then immediately using Gust.<br/>This leaves the target slowed, and silenced, and therefore unable to react (apart from using items).<br/><br/><h4>Precision Aura</h4>If you are having trouble landing last hits, an early point or two in Precision Aura will help.<br/><br/>Don't forget to use Precision Aura's active ability. It is very useful for pushing down towers.<br/>Since the active applies an aura and not a buff, it works even for ranged creeps/summons that spawn after you use it.<br/><br/>Try to use the active when creep waves have catapults.<br/><br/>The active lasts a considerable 30 seconds, but has a long 120 second cooldown. In the late game, reserve it for sieging barracks, or when going for an all-out attack on the enemy ancient.<br/><br/><br/>Although Precision Aura greatly benefits other ranged heroes, it is usually unwise to have two fragile ranged carries on the same team. Consider this during the picking phase.<br/><h4>Marksmanship</h4>Marksmanship's damage bonus has a particle effect. It disappears when enemies are nearby.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Healing Salve gives Drow Ranger a massive boost of health regeneration in one go.<br/><br/>Tangos help providing Drow Ranger with health regeneration in the early game.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility provide a boost to Drow Ranger's primary attribute: agility; allowing for easier last hitting and more damage when attacking enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Iron Branches provide a boost to all of Drow Ranger's attributes, which can be helpful in the lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give Drow Ranger a speed boost which can be helpful for getting around.<br/><br/>Magic Stick can be a good idea to pick up if the enemy is using a lot of spells, meaning Drow Ranger can use the stick charges in emergency.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila provides Drow Ranger with bonus attributes which can be helpful in the early game. It can be sold in the late game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Tome of Knowledge helps Drow Ranger reach the crucial levels for her ultimate.<br/><br/>Magic Wand can be a good idea to upgrade to from the Magic Stick to take further advantage of enemy spell casting, in case of emergency.<br/><br/>Power Treads provide Drow Ranger with attack speed and additional attributes.<br/><br/>Morbid Mask's lifesteal keeps Drow Ranger on the field, allowing her to farm continuously.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance provides useful stats for a highly cost effective price, and the increased range allows Drow Ranger to easily achieve good positioning. It also lets her outrange towers, letting her destroy them without much risk.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Shadow Blade provides an escape for Drow Ranger, who does not have a built in escape. It also provides some useful attack speed and damage.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is a natural next step to Shadow Blade, and can be very effective in ganking.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator provides good cheap stats and can also take control of creeps.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives her some stats and is good item in the mid/late game against illusions/push strategies, especially with Mjollnir.<br/><br/>Butterfly provides ever-useful agility for Drow Ranger. It is usually picked up to help Drow Ranger defend against efficient backline attackers.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade is overall good item for agility carry and especially for Drow Ranger due to her passive.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar provides an excellent damage and attack speed boost, as well as a counter against evasion heroes. However, it has no defensive boosts, and makes Drow Ranger into even more of a glass cannon.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness is a good source of lifesteal, and is useful for farming. It also provides a nice boost to Drow Ranger's attack and movement speed.<br/><br/>Daedalus provides Drow Ranger with a critical strike chance, which synergizes well with the attack speed and damage she gets from her abilities, maximizing her DPS.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is important if Drow Ranger is facing a team with many disables, giving her enough time to deal at least some damage.<br/><br/>Satanic provides Drow Ranger with a huge amount of lifesteal for a short period of time, allowing Drow Ranger to stand her ground and regain practically all of her health with just a few shots.<br/><br/>Hurricane Pike builds naturally from Dragon Lance, and is very useful in keeping distance between Drow Ranger and her enemies.<br/><br/>Manta Style provides Drow Ranger with mobility, stats, the ability to disjoint projectiles and create illusions of herself. Because her illusions benefit from Marksmanship, Manta Style provides Drow Ranger with a large damage increase, especially when sieging buildings.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives a decent stats boost, and stacks with Frost Arrows, slowing the enemy further.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ember Spirit is a very mobile and evasive carry due to his ability to strike from range or dodge enemy attacks using Sleight of Fist and Fire Remnants. Playing Ember Spirit requires quick reflexes, good judgment and an aggressive mindset, as his instant cast animations and high mobility allow skilled players to outplay and outwit opponents, darting around the map to be where they least expect.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great mobility, hard to kill in teamfights.<br/><br/>Global-wide presence, Strong pushing skillset.<br/><br/>Deals AOE physical damage that scales into late game.<br/><br/>Large magical damage in early to mid game.<br/><br/>Absorbs moderate amount of magical damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low agility growth.<br/><br/>Weak manfight capability.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to silences and chain stuns.<br/><br/>High requirement for good positioning and reflexes.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>The only benefit of leveling up Fire Remnant is its damage; The number and duration of remnants remains the same. It is viable to level Fire Remnant sooner for more burst damage in incoming teamfight.<br/><br/>When laning against certain heroes (in mid) that rely on skill to harass ( Queen of Pain's Shadow Strike, Shadow Fiend's Shadowraze (Far), Windranger's Powershot), one point in Sleight of Fist might be valuable to dodge their damage. Note that Sleight of Fist dodge skills by rendering Ember Spirit invulnerable rather than disjointing them. As an example, Sleight of Fist should be used just before Shadow Strike hits you, not immediately after the skill being used.<br/><br/>Sleight of Fist doesn't help Ember Spirit farm at all in early to mid game when he has few attack damage items. Flame Guard and Searing Chains help a lot to deal damage, and Fire Remnant helps Ember Spirit move around the map quickly and farm dangerous lanes.<br/><br/>Ember Spirit has mana issues early in the game - using Fire Remnant to chase will often put you in danger. The higher level of Sleight of Fist you get, the further your Searing Chains can hold the enemy.<br/><br/><h3>General</h3>While Xin is an agility hero, Ember Spirit has very low armor and poor agility growth, making him vulnerable to physical damage despite his respectable strength growth. As such, he depends on using his spells and mobility to dodge attacks, disjoint projectiles and evade counterattack. His dependency on casting also makes him vulnerable to disables, particularly stuns and silences, as they prevent him from avoiding damage that his small HP pool is ill-suited to deal with.<br/><br/>In general, Ember Spirit is best played either as a core farmer in the safe lane, or as a mid. As a safe lane farmer, Ember Spirit can safely farm up the items he needs to become a late-game threat, and his mobility allows him to engage on the enemy off-laner unexpectedly and help disable them during ganks, or evade enemy ganks targeted on him. As a mid, getting fast levels early on allows him to gank side lanes and get kills with his mobility and disables, giving him a strong early-game presence and allowing him to snowball out of control.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Searing Chains</h4>Searing Chains is a powerful disable spell that stops up to two nearby enemies in their tracks and deals damage for the duration.<br/><br/>Searing Chains' scaling means that it can be used as a strong early-game damage nuke, and its low cooldown allows it to be cast multiple times in a fight if need be. As such, it is a good candidate for your first ability to max out.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, the targets for Searing Chains are chosen randomly, so creeps can be hit if they are within the spell's radius. When attempting to chain down an enemy player, ensure that there are no creeps nearby that can foul your attempts to disable them, or try to position Ember Spirit such that only the hero and at most one other unit are within the spell's radius.<br/><br/>This ability can be combined with Sleight of Fist, as the latter spell positions Ember Spirit next to the target to be slashed during each strike. This means that Sleight followed by Chains can allow Ember Spirit to root enemies from long range if the combo is timed correctly.<br/><br/>One strong aspect of Searing Chains is that it will root affected targets, preventing them from using true blink abilities as well as a few other escape abilities. As such, it can be very potent against certain heroes that rely on using true blink to escape, such as Anti-Mage and Queen of Pain.<br/><br/>Searing Chains will interrupt channeling spells upon cast. This is most useful for interrupting Town Portal Scrolls, and spells like Black Hole or Death Ward. However, in the case of Town Portal Scrolls, make sure to use the spell only after the enemy begins an attempt to teleport to safety, as Searing Chains' cooldown duration means that they can safely teleport after it has been used.<br/><h4>Sleight of Fist</h4>Sleight of Fist is best described as an area-of-effect physical damage nuke that allows Ember Spirit to apply auto-attack damage to all enemies within the spell's radius.<br/><br/>While this spell does not disjoint projectiles, Ember Spirit is invulnerable for its duration, so any projectiles that hit him during the spell will not affect him. As such, it can be used to effectively dodge damage and disables by becoming invulnerable as the projectile hits him.<br/><br/>Remember that creeps hit by this spell will take half damage from Ember Spirit's strikes and do not take the bonus damage, so it is a poor early farming ability. Only once Ember Spirit has accumulated enough raw damage and a cleave will it be useful for cutting down groups of creeps.<br/><br/>Conversely, as the damage dealt is based on Ember Spirit's attack damage, Sleight of Fist is one of the strongest scaling abilities in the game, since Ember Spirit can apply large amounts of physical damage as well as attack modifiers on the entire enemy team every six seconds. If Ember Spirit builds enough raw damage items, he can potentially wipe the entire enemy team in a single cast of this spell.<br/><br/>Mind that evasion, blind and disarm will affect Sleight of Fist, so it is possible that strikes during this spell will not hit their targets depending on any evasion items the enemy is carrying, or if Ember Spirit is affected by blind or disarm.<br/><br/>Invisible enemies will not be targeted for a slash by this spell, however it will hit enemies in the fog of war. Combined with Searing Chains, this allows Ember Spirit to jump at enemies in the dark and chain them down, which can prevent players from juking into the jungle and teleporting away.<br/><br/>Ember Spirit can still cast spells and use items during Sleight of Fist, though he will still return to his original position regardless. As such, it is possible to execute unorthodox combos such as beginning to channel Town Portal Scroll during the invulnerability or sending a Fire Remnant during the slashes and then jumping to it once done. Be sure to gauge your timing based on the number of targets within the striking area, however, as more targets means a greater slashing duration.<br/><br/>It's very important to remember that, no matter what, Ember Spirit will always return to the position he was in when Sleight of Fist was cast as soon as it's over - Using Blink Dagger, Activate Fire Remnant, teleporting, among other things that can alter his position, are never queued, they occur as soon as they are activated and Ember will continue slashing any left targets if Sleight of Fist had not concluded by then no matter where he is, and then return to the cast position.<br/><br/>Regarding purchasing more than one Battle Fury, bear in mind that your second one will increase your cleave damage by 100%, and your third by 50%. Getting a fourth is not recommended as it increases the damage by 33.3% in relation to your current cleave damage, and as such, it is better to get a Daedalus as the critical chance grants approximately a 35% overall damage increase.<br/><h4>Flame Guard</h4>Flame Guard shields Ember Spirit from magical damage, traditionally an agility carry's greatest weakness, while also allowing him to deal burn damage to all nearby enemies.<br/><br/>Besides the charge restore time on Fire Remnants, Flame Guard is Ember Spirit's longest cooldown ability. As such, try to use it sparingly, as casting it to farm creeps may leave you vulnerable if the enemy attempts to gank you shortly after.<br/><br/>In the early game, Flame Guard gives Ember Spirit protection against magic damage, as well as allowing him to deal it to enemies while chasing them down. As such, Xin is a potent early-game fighter if he has a few points in this ability.<br/><br/>In order to use this spell to its maximum effectiveness, particularly in mid match-ups, try to aim to only skill it to the point where you can ignore the enemy's burst damage attack and still have the shield up to deal burn damage to them. If facing a weak magic nuker in the mid lane, one or two points in this ability can allow you to shrug off their alpha strike, and then continue to deal burn damage to them while also expending the remaining points in Searing Chains, increasing its overall damage and disable duration.<br/><h4>Fire Remnant</h4>Fire Remnant allows Ember Spirit to place a Fire Remnant at the target location, and then cast Activate Fire Remnant to quickly dash to it, exploding it to deal area magical damage.<br/><br/>Fire Remnant is Ember Spirit's primary mobility, initiation and escape ability, as it allows him to re-position himself almost instantly, no matter his position relative to the remnant. As such, it can be used not only to quickly close the distance to an enemy while dealing nuke damage upon arriving, it can also be used to move across the map, whether to escape from an enemy gank or to arrive at a friendly one.<br/><br/>As with Sleight of Fist, Ember Spirit does not disjoint projectiles upon casting Activate Fire Remnant, but is invulnerable during the travel time. As such, it can be used to disjoint projectiles if they connect with him while he is invulnerable, though beware of projectiles continuing to chase you if the remnant's location does not allow you to path over the projectile during the spell. If this is the case, consider having Sleight of Fist ready to cast on any non-friendly creeps at your destination, in order to dodge any projectiles that might follow you across the map.<br/><br/>Beware of Activate Fire Remnant's heavy mana cost, as combined with Ember Spirit's small mana pool it can completely drain him of mana if he tries to cast it more than once or uses it in combination with his other spells. Always keep an eye on your mana to ensure that you're able to cast Activate Fire Remnant when needed, and try to avoid using it more than once in a short period of time as this also depletes your Fire Remnant reserve.<br/><br/>Fire Remnants do not provide any vision and are thus not visible through the fog of war. Remembering where the remnants were placed is important, in order to not get accidentally in danger.<br/><br/>While its most basic use is to initiate on an enemy over distance, Fire Remnants can also be used as an escape tool. By placing one in an area of known safety, Ember Spirit can instantly dash away in the face of overwhelming danger, evading ganks or quickly retreating after a successful kill.<br/><br/>Beware that the Fire Remnant's travel speed is based on that of Ember Spirit when it is sent forth. This means that if Ember Spirit is suffering from slow debuffs, the remnant will take longer to reach its destination, which can give the enemy more time to kill him. As such, it is wise to place a remnant beforehand, or to avoid being affected by slows before casting it. Conversely, this also means that its travel speed can be boosted by increasing Ember Spirit's movement speed, such as using Drum of Endurance's active.<br/><br/>Fire Remnants do not scale very well, as the only thing that increases is the amount of damage dealt by an exploding remnant upon arrival. Unless you regularly use the explosion damage as part of a damage nuke, it is usually wise to skill it at level 6 but to avoid taking additional levels until your other regular abilities are maxed out.<br/><br/>In concert to the above, a dangerous but powerful tactic is to cast all three Fire Remnants at a target location and then dash to them, dealing 300/450/600 near-instantaneous alpha damage. However, keep in mind that this will completely deplete your remnant reserve, greatly reducing your mobility for at least the next 35 seconds.<br/><br/>One useful trick with Fire Remnants is that, due to their global re-positioning potential, they can be dropped in place prior to using a Town Portal Scroll or other globally re-positioning item, and then return to your previous location if so desired. This can be useful for things such as quickly replenishing HP and mana at base, quickly teleporting to defend or counter-gank and then returning to farming/pushing, and so on. In particular, the first tactic is extremely strong when combined with a Bottle, as Ember Spirit can replenish his HP and mana, grab any items from stash, and refill his bottle all at the cost of a Town Portal Scroll and a Fire Remnant charge.<br/><br/>As well as the above, Fire Remnants can be used to quickly return to battle after buying back. If a Fire Remnant is placed near a battle and Ember Spirit is killed, buying back and then casting Activate Fire Remnant can allow him to instantly return to a fight, bringing his damage nukes and disables with him to turn the tide for his team.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and a Healing Salve help Ember Spirit sustain during the laning phase, preventing him from being forced to return to base due to enemy harassment.<br/><br/>Faerie Fire may help you survive a gank or lethal attack from tower after killing enemy. It also helps with last hitting.<br/><br/>Iron Branch is a cheap and effective way to improve Ember Spirit's mana pool and health pool, both of which are lacking in the early game.<br/><br/>Stout Shield is recommended as it will significantly reduce the enemy's auto-attack harass potential, meaning Ember Spirit is able to sustain longer in lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Poor Man's Shield is good to reduce harassment from ranged heroes in lane. It is a go-to item when facing most heroes in mid.<br/><br/>Bottle gives Ember Spirit a way to sustain his HP and mana, allowing him to remain out in the field to farm or fight. It is best purchased if Ember Spirit is played as a mid hero, as he can access runes more easily.<br/><br/>Infused Raindrop can mitigate magical damage in fights, also helps with mana regeneration.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are essential for Ember Spirit, as the improved speed will allow him to escape deadly situations, as well as catch up to an escaping enemy. It also improves his ability to successfully catch an escaping hero with Searing Chains.<br/><br/>Bracer gives Ember Spirit good stats all around, most importantly more HP. It can be upgraded into a Drum of Endurance.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius offers armor and mana regen, also helps with early game pushing.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should be carried at all times by all heroes. TP scrolls allow Ember Spirit to move around the map to find farm and reach fights and ganks quickly, as his spells make him a force to be reckoned with in any engagement. When Combined with Fire Remnant, it allows Ember Spirit to regenerate in fountain and come back quickly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Boots Choice:</b><br/>Phase Boots gives Ember Spirit the mobility to chase or escape engagements in order to cast Searing Chains. Yet the raw bonus damage doesn't scale, and the item doesn't help Ember Spirit to farm that much. It is best to get this item if you aim to fight aggressively in early to mid game.<br/><br/>Power Treads increases Ember Spirit's attack speed as well as his stats. It can be the choice if Ember Spirit need to play defensively in early game. Tread Switching also helps with regeneration.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel can be a powerful purchase on Ember Spirit in the mid-game. Aside from freeing up an inventory slot and saving gold from not having to constantly purchase Town Portal Scrolls, the increased movement speed gives Ember Spirit increased mobility, allowing him to chase down enemies more easily. As well, the teleport increases Xin's global presence, especially when combined with Fire Remnants, as he can make quick returns to base to grab items or replenish HP and mana, assist in gank opportunities on other parts of the map, and so on.<br/><br/><br/><b>Mid Game Item Choice:</b><br/>Drum of Endurance, gives Ember Spirit all-around stats, shoring up his HP and mana pool as well as giving him increased damage, which combined with the aura allows him to engage in teamfight earlier. The bonus movement speed increases his mobility, allowing him to position himself to use his spells more easily.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila is a natural upgrade of Ring of Basilius. It gives Ember Spirit more last-hitting power and protection against physical damage, while the small amount of mana regen can allow him to use his spells more often. The Aquila Aura helps with pushing a lot, and when combined with Fire Remnant the item allows Ember Spirit to push deep in enemy territory.<br/><br/>Battle Fury is a highly potent item in Ember Spirit's hands, both for farming and fighting. The HP and mana regen help to keep him topped up, allowing him to farm jungle camps using his spells and ensuring that he can enter fights will full HP and mana. The cleave allows him to farm creeps more easily, and can inflict vast amounts of damage to the enemy team when combined with Sleight of Fist.<br/>A second Battle Fury, and possibly a third or more, is very powerful on Xin when dealing with illusion army or swarms of heroes, as it increases the cleave percentage as well as the amount of damage he deals with Sleight of Fist.<br/><br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a very powerful mid game item for Ember Spirit. With Discord and 12% Spell Amplification talent, Xin can deal lots of magic damage with his abilities.<br/><br/><br/><b>Late Game items:</b><br/>Blink Dagger is very situational, but can drastically increase Ember Spirit's mobility by allowing him to initiate on enemies without having to use a Fire Remnant, so that Ember Spirit can save the remnant in the back and return to in bad situation. It also allows him to move around the map more quickly and bypass trees and terrain, which lets him catch enemies unaware or run from fights more easily. Blink Dagger also give Ember Spirit much more chance to right-click enemy by jumping forward and deal more damage.<br/><br/>Daedalus provides Ember Spirit with great additional damage and a chance to deal 2.2x damage on an attack. It synergies extremely well with Sleight of Fist, allowing for powerful damage output at a distance.<br/>Multiple Daedalus allows Ember Spirit to inflict tremendous amounts of physical damage using Sleight of Fist, potentially resulting in multi-kills against the enemy team if they are clustered together.<br/><br/><br/>Monkey King Bar is a strong damage item that also provides True Strike, eliminating any possibility of the enemy evading his Sleight of Fist slashes via evasion or blind. It can be a powerful purchase in the face of enemies purchasing evasion or when facing enemies with blind spells, and the mini-bash proc can allow Ember Spirit to deal even more damage during Sleight of Fist.<br/><br/><br/><b>Survivability Items:</b><br/>Black King Bar is a must-have item in the face of heavy disables. As he can be killed very quickly if ever stunned or silenced, spell immunity allows Ember Spirit to engage the enemy head-on and ignore their disables while fighting, giving him a bigger damage window before he needs to retreat. As well, it gives him additional strength, increasing the size of his HP pool, as well as more raw damage.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere gives Ember Spirit stats across the board, as well as passive HP and mana regen. The Spell Block passive allows Ember Spirit to shrug off one targeted spell during a fight, hopefully a targeted disable, increasing his slipperiness and allowing him to fight without fear of being disabled.<br/><br/>Manta Style gives Ember Spirit a measure of defense against silences, as he can instantly purge off debuffs, especially silence, while also creating two illusions with which to confuse the enemy. The item itself also provides very useful bonuses, giving him all-around stats, more agility and attack speed, and a movement speed bonus that increases his mobility. Finally, as items can be used during Sleight of Fist, combining this item, Sleight of Fist and Searing Chains can allow Ember Spirit to root and place illusions near a target from long range.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items</b><br/>Divine Rapier is one of the strongest items that Ember Spirit can purchase, as, combined with a cleave and crit, can allow him to deal absurd amount of physical damage to the entire enemy team during Sleight of Fist. While it is extremely expensive and extremely risky due to the possibility of giving it to the enemy upon being killed, Ember Spirit's ability to evade the enemy and avoid damage allow him to push this item to its limit and emerge victorious.<br/><br/>Butterfly can be very powerful in the hands of Ember Spirit, as it grants him evasion while also increasing his physical DPS. The passive evasion decreases his vulnerability against physical damage, while the active can give him more mobility to flee from a fight or chase an enemy down.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi provides Ember Spirit with stats across the board, greatly increasing his survivability and offensive potential. Combined with Sleight of Fist, he can inflict the slow to multiple enemy heroes at once, through spell immunity, slowing them down drastically and preventing them from chasing, escaping or spreading out as quickly.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass increases Ember Spirit's damage output while also negating his weakness to physical damage. The increased armor and attack speed mitigate his low agility growth, giving him stronger presence on the battlefield. The aura helps give allies more armor and attack speed, and reduces enemy armor as well, making them more vulnerable to Sleight of Fist strikes.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is a powerful late item for magical Ember, which gives hip more survivability and increases spells cooldowns. With 15% Cooldown Reduction and +2 sec Searing Chains talents, Xin can easy catch his opponents.<br/><br/><br/><b>Uncommon Items</b><br/>Maelstrom is an alternative item choice other than Battle Fury. The Chain Lightning effect will proc when casting Sleight of Fist. It is much cheaper than Battle Fury and allows Ember Spirit to clear illusions much earlier.<br/>Mjollnir can be upgraded from Maelstrom. The Static Charge ability can be used to discourage enemies from attacking Ember Spirit as well, for fear of proccing the discharge. Note that the additional attack speed is not very useful on Ember Spirit as his main source of physical damage is Sleight of Fist.<br/><br/><br/>Satanic greatly increases Ember Spirit's survivability in fights. The lifesteal, on top of allowing him to farm more easily, also procs during Sleight of Fist, allowing Xin to lifesteal drastic amounts of HP in fights, especially when the active ability is used. The increased strength and armor also give him more survivability against physical damage, making him harder to kill if he is ever caught.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade increases Ember Spirit's physical DPS, and gives him an additional method with which to initiate on enemies during ganks. As well, if Sleight of Fist is cast during the 0.3 second fade time, Ember Spirit will deal the 175 bonus damage to all slashed targets and remain invisible upon returning to the remnant. However, beware that this tactic does not apply to Silver Edge.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Faceless Void is a hero who holds mastery over time. He dashes through the battlefield, rewinding damage with Time Walk, stuns enemies with Time Lock, and causes their abilities to recharge slower with Time Dilation. His signature ability, Chronosphere, creates a bubble in space-time, stopping everything caught within so he and his team can beat down the enemy without retribution. As a melee carry, Faceless Void requires a large amount of farm in order to deal decent damage, but can be devastatingly powerful once he has his items. Faceless Void can be played solo in the off-lane, or with a support in the safe lane.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Fulfills both carry and initiator roles.<br/><br/>Low cooldown escape ability.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item and farm dependent.<br/><br/>No room for mistakes with his ultimate.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Time Lock average stats (hero)<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Time Walk</h4>Time Walk is a Pseudo Blink ability that renders Faceless Void invulnerable as he quickly jumps to the target location.<br/><br/>The most general use for Time Walk is to allow Faceless Void to close the distance to an enemy, either to attack them or to cast Chronosphere. As such, it can be important to get many early levels in this ability to maximize Darkterror's initiation potential.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Time Walk can be used as an escape spell to put distance between Faceless Void and any incoming attackers. However, beware that it does not disjoint projectiles, so attacks that follow him to his destination can still hit him.<br/><br/>Evasion can be useful to build on Faceless Void in order to augment his survivability further. The evasion will prevent secondary effects of physical attacks from proccing, since the attack itself does not count as landing. This can allow Faceless Void to ignore the secondary effects of attacks like Mana Break, Essence Shift, bashes, and so on.<br/><h4>Time Dilation</h4>Time Dilation provides a considerable move and attack speed slow to the debuffed targets, but mostly hinders the opponent's ability to spam spells. Thus, it is best used against heroes that have quick, spammable spells with low cooldowns, such as Invoker's Invoke, Zeus's Arc Lightning or Bristleback's Quill Spray and Viscous Nasal Goo.<br/><br/>It remains potent against enemies with moderate cds, since time dilation's duration may prevent them from casting their spell a second time during an engagement.<br/><br/>If you're fighting an enemy one-on-one, use it when Chronosphere is about to expire instead of at the start, to waste no time on the debuff's duration.<br/><h4>Time Lock</h4>Time Lock is a powerful bash-type passive ability that allows Faceless Void's attacks to stun enemies and deal bonus damage.<br/><br/>Time Lock allows Faceless Void's damage and disable potential to scale tremendously with attack speed, as each proc instance of Time Lock will stun and deal bonus magical damage. With enough attack speed, Faceless Void can keep an enemy almost permanently disabled through repeated bashes, and deal large amounts of damage with those bashes.<br/><br/>Getting several levels in Time Lock, alongside increasing Faceless Void's attack speed, will greatly boost the amount of damage he deals.<br/><br/>Time Lock pierces spell immunity, allowing it to stun enemies who have activated Black King Bar, as well as siege creeps. The former case can be a powerful use of crowd control to disable enemies through spell immunity, while the latter case can be helpful for stopping pushes by removing a siege creep's damage output for a short duration if it is attacking a tower.<br/><h4>Chronosphere</h4>Chronosphere is one of the most powerful and most feared area disables in the game, capable of stopping entire teams in their tracks regardless of spell immunity. Used wisely, it can allow Faceless Void and his allies to kill numerous enemy players with little to no resistance.<br/><br/>Due to its extremely long cooldown, Chronosphere must be used wisely, as Faceless Void is very weak without it. As teamfights do not happen regularly in the early game, Chronosphere can be used to secure kills in the laning phase, however once teamfights start becoming more frequent the spell must be kept in reserve until the right moment.<br/><br/>Faceless Void (as well as any units under his control) gains 1000 movement speed and phase movement inside his own Chronosphere, allowing him to attack any targets within as needed. Try to catch enemies in Chronosphere first, and then select targets once they are disabled. As well, remember that Faceless Void will never be disabled by a Chronosphere, even one cast by an enemy, though he will not gain the movement bonuses inside a Chronosphere that he does not own.<br/><br/>However, be very wary if there is a Rubick on the enemy team. While Faceless Void can still move inside of Rubick's Chronosphere, his teammates cannot. Fortunately, Faceless Void can easily avoid Spell Steal since he is able to cast Time Dilation in order to have it as his last cast spell, but of course, be sure to catch Rubick inside of Chronosphere to ensure that he does not steal it and use it against your teammates.<br/><br/>Take special care when casting Chronosphere; unlike other disables in the game, it is capable of freezing allies in place, not just enemies. Avoid trapping teammates inside a Chronosphere unless a decisive advantage can be secured, and try to place the Chronosphere such that it does not impede allies' movements as they attempt to assist in a teamfight.<br/><br/>It can be useful to target Chronosphere such that part of it can deny terrain to the enemy. Placing the sphere such that the enemy cannot assist without entering the sphere can help ensure that they will not be able to interfere as much, if at all, in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Remember that Chronosphere will freeze buildings as well, not just units; this includes fountains, friendly or enemy. This makes Chronosphere very strong for diving enemy towers and even their fountain, as Faceless Void can prevent them from attacking him and take advantage of the boosted movement speed to enter and leave at high speed.<br/><br/>The key to utilizing Chronosphere properly is target prioritization. Be sure to coordinate with teammates to kill important targets during the Chronosphere, which may not always be the enemy's carry. If Chronosphere can catch supports with powerful spells and teamfight items, killing them first can remove those abilities and items from the field, making the remainder of the fight much harder for the enemy.<br/><br/>As well, Chronosphere's disable potential can be greatly augmented by additional crowd control from teammates. Spells such as Reverse Polarity, Vacuum, Berserker's Call can clump the enemy up together to allow Faceless Void to trap several of them at once. Once clumped together, the enemy becomes extremely vulnerable to area-of-effect nukes such as Chain Frost, Earth Splitter, Sonic Wave, and so on.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that while enemies inside of Chronosphere are helpless, those outside can still hinder Faceless Void's attempts to kill their teammates. This means that spells such as Shallow Grave, Cold Embrace and Purification can foil attempts at getting kills, and disables can still be targeted on Faceless Void to render him unable to act during Chronosphere. This further emphasizes the importance of target prioritization, as it may be necessary to target Chronosphere on supports over carries, or it may be necessary to kill targets outside of the Chronosphere first.<br/><br/>Chronosphere will reveal invisible enemies within the sphere, making it powerful against certain spells like Moonlight Shadow and Shukuchi.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Faceless Void's longer-than-normal cast animation, combined with the travel time of Time Walk, can allow alert enemies to completely dodge Chronosphere if they react quickly enough. As such, try to cast Chronosphere immediately upon emerging from Time Walk, and try to target it on enemies that do not have the ability to instantly re-position themselves to evade it.<br/><br/>If enemies become invulnerable before Chronosphere is cast, they will not be affected by it, whether it is an ally or enemy. This means that a Juggernaut can continue hitting targets inside with Omnislash, Storm Spirit can travel through with Ball Lightning, and so on.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Quelling Blade greatly increases Faceless Void's ability to last-hit creeps, which is important for ensuring that he farms well in the early game. By augmenting his already formidable attack damage, Faceless Void can ensure that the enemy has a hard time denying him even if they are in a position to.<br/><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are important for ensuring that Faceless Void remains in-lane despite enemy attempts to harass him. Because Darkterror is a melee hero, he must get closer to the creep wave in order to last-hit and thus exposes himself to harassment.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility provides Faceless Void with increased base damage as well as a small amount of armor, giving him better farming power and a little physical survivability.<br/><br/>Stout Shield can be a very strong starting item to purchase on Faceless Void, as it provides him with damage block from the start, ensuring that he has survival against harass damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick can be useful to get on Faceless Void given his small base HP and mana pool. The burst regen can give him more survivability and the ability to cast his spells if he finds himself in lots of early engagements.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed give Darkterror more movement speed, important in the early game since he is a melee hero who must be able to position himself quickly for last-hitting and avoiding harass.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield is useful for providing Darkterror with damage block as well as additional armor and base damage. Increasing his survivability in the early game is important for ensuring that he can transition past the laning stage and become a threat later in the game.<br/><br/>Morbid Mask allows Faceless Void to lifesteal, important for ensuring that his HP remains topped off, especially while farming in the jungle. As well, the lifesteal still applies during Time Lock procs, and it builds into a Mask of Madness, which is a very important item to get.<br/><br/>Iron Talon helps Faceless Void get extra farm. Use it to clear out the side camp next to the off-lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Ring of Aquila is useful for providing Faceless Void with early attributes and mana regen. The all-around stats give him more base damage, HP and mana, the armor gives him increased survivability and helps reduce damage taken from creeps while farming, and the mana regen greatly helps to replenish his mana given his poor base intelligence and intelligence growth.<br/><br/>Magic Wand can give Faceless Void increased stats, and provides even more burst HP and mana regen than Magic Stick.<br/><br/>Power Treads provides bonus attack speed and the ability to switch attributes, useful for giving Faceless Void more HP for survivability, more mana for casting spells on his limited mana pool, or more attack speed and base damage for dealing damage.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to have on all heroes. The immense initiating and disabling power of Chronosphere means that Faceless Void's presence in any teamfight can assure victory if he initiates properly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a situational item to pick up on Faceless Void. As the item provides survivability and not increased damage output, it does not greatly assist Faceless Void in killing enemies during Chronosphere. However, the greatly decreased cooldown allows Chronosphere to be used tactically, getting guaranteed pick-offs against lone enemies and then coming off cooldown in time for the next engagement. As well, the bonus mana and intelligence decrease the strain that Chronosphere's high mana cost places on Faceless Void's mana pool.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger massively enhances Faceless Void's initiation factor. With its range almost double that of Time Walk, it's an important item for catching multiple enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Butterfly is a very powerful item to have on Faceless Void. The evasion gives him survivability against physical attacks, increasing his ability to ignore enemy attacks while the increased agility, damage and attack speed greatly increase his ability to deal damage with his attacks.<br/><br/>Daedalus is one of the best damage boosting items Faceless Void can pick up. The added damage and 2.4x crit will boost your physical damage output immensely. When coupled with some attack speed boosting items, Faceless Void becomes a very fearsome threat against enemies.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar grants True Strike, some attack speed and a significant increase in attack damage. It can be a necessary item to get in order to deal damage to enemies that have evasion.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is always useful in any low-HP hero. The gigantic HP increase will allow Faceless Void to better weather attacks, especially from damage nukes that may be targeted on him from outside of a Chronosphere. The HP regen outside of battle can also allow him to become a bigger threat against the enemy team if he manages to slip away temporarily, as he can return shortly after with a full HP bar that the enemy must chip away at all over again.<br/><br/>Moon Shard can be a strong damage item for Faceless Void. The greatly increased attack speed can allow him to proc Time Lock and certain items much more often, greatly increasing his DPS. The increased night vision range can give him a strong vision advantage at night which in turn can allow him to initiate good fights he otherwise could not have seen. Consuming the item can free up an inventory slot for a permanent attack speed bonus, clearing up the item slot for an extra lategame item.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can be a powerful defensive item if the enemy has ranged disablers nukers that can position themselves to avoid being caught by Chronosphere. Activating spell immunity during Chronosphere allows Faceless Void to avoid being disabled or nuked down from outside the sphere, which lets him focus his undivided attention on targets inside. The item also provides Faceless Void with more HP and attack damage, giving him increased survivability and damage output.<br/><br/>Battle Fury is a well-balanced farming item that provides Faceless Void with self-sustain as well as attack damage. The HP and mana regen let Faceless Void farm for extended periods of time without returning to base, while the cleave, bonus creep damage and additional attack damage allow him to farm creeps more quickly. As well, the cleave allows Faceless Void to spread physical damage around inside of Chronosphere, useful if he can catch multiple enemies in close proximity.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is a strong farming and attack damage item that greatly increases Faceless Void's damage output during Chronosphere. The increased attack speed and Unique Attack Modifier allow Faceless Void to farm creeps more quickly, and the Chain Lightning can proc multiple times during a Chronosphere to spread magical damage around to all caught enemies. As well, the active can allow Faceless Void to punish enemies if they try to attack him, whether he is inside a Chronosphere or not.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is a risky but strong utility item that allows Faceless Void to cast Chronosphere twice in a teamfight. While purchasing a Refresher Orb will reduce Faceless Void's carry potential as it does not provide him with increased damage output, doubling up on Chronosphere's disable duration can give Faceless Void's team an additional window with which to focus and burst down enemy heroes, which can be necessary for winning fights.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a safer alternative to Mask of Madness trading away the attack speed and added damage in exchange for more well rounded stats and an aura that affects your team.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is commonly built as a means to increase Faceless Void's survivability in conjunction with Time Walk. It prevents single target disables or silences from disrupting his initiation with Chronosphere and can save his life in a gank.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade is a solid damage increasing pick up that also allows Faceless Void to remove silences, slows, and several other sorts of debuffs, potentially saving his life or preventing his initiation from being disrupted. As well, it's a good item to pick up if against enemies who are weak to losing their mana, such as Wraith King to prevent him from reencarnating, or Morphling to prevent him from escaping using his various escaping tools or gaining a lot of strength through Morph.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is another potential pick up if the user needs to burn the enemy's mana pool, and it's much more efficient at it than Diffusal Blade while also granting Void stronger pushing potential which is otherwise very weak. However, a level 3 Necronomicon is also far more costly than Diffusal Blade (Even taking into account the need to eventually buy another recipe) and offers nothing to Void if the summons are killed, making it a highly situational pick up.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Gyrocopter is a ranged carry who specializes at dishing out physical and magical damage over a wide area. He presents an unorthodox pattern of carry in that he can deal a large amount of magical damage and crowd control much earlier than other carry heroes thanks to Call Down and Rocket Barrage. As game goes on, Flak Cannon adds up his physical damage output and maintains his threat to entire enemy team.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals wide area damage.<br/><br/>High early game damage compared to most carries.<br/><br/>Fast farmer.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Relatively fragile.<br/><br/>Shorter attack range than other ranged carries.<br/><br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>As an agility hero with moderate HP pool and no innate escape ability, Gyrocopter is somewhat squishy and relies on item to keep himself alive in fight. His magical damage advantage diminishes after enemy carry becomes magic immune, and as a ranged hero with short attack range he has little advantage in direct manfight with enemy carries if not with a gold gold advantage. Also, most of his damage could be evaded if not timed correctly.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Gyrocopter could play as a greedy roaming support. By leveling Rocket Barrage and Homing Missile, he can initiate a gank and take down heroes together with his teammates. After gaining advantage he can flash farm using his skills and transit into a semi-carry. Note that more utility items can be made other than traditional carry items here.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Rocket Barrage</h4>Rocket Barrage is a spell which could potentially deal heavy damage around towards a single target and generally should be maxed first.<br/><br/>Rocket Barrage is incredibly powerful against a single enemy, but its damage falls off dramatically if there are multiple targets. Position yourself far from the creeps while close to enemy to make the best use of it.<br/>Since Call Down and Flak Cannon deals AoE damage to creeps/illusions/summons, these skills have great synergy with Rocket Barrage and could increase its damage on a single hero.<br/><br/><br/>From patch 6.84, Rocket Barrage has no cast foreswing, so Gyrocopter can simply follow the enemy to release the salvo of rockets.<br/><br/>Gyrocopter can still attack when using Rocket Barrage, however the attack animation may hinder the chase towards enemy. However, with a movement speed advantage (e.g., Boots, Yasha, Butterfly - Flutter) you can remain attacking enemy while chasing, and also feel free to activate in a one-on-one fight when enemy hero has no spell immune.<br/><br/>Rocket Barrage will not cause vision when losing vision of enemy even it is still in range. Call Down and Homing Missile could potentially provide the area vision which may be critical to focus down an enemy.<br/><br/>Rocket Barrage should be spammed in teamfights, however time it well so that the damage could be inflicted on the right enemy.<br/><br/>Use Rocket Barrage for farming or hit and run.<br/><h4>Homing Missile</h4>Homing Missile is an unorthodox single target disable: it launches a missile which takes time to hit the target and can hit the target with surprisingly amount of damage and stun.<br/><br/>There are different strategies in leveling Homing Missile: some common ones include not leveling it until level 22, putting a single point in it in level 10 after adding up other skills then left it behind until level 23, and maxing it out right behind Rocket Barrage. The general idea is that Gyrocopter needs survivability and damage output and would focus less on control as a carry, as Homing Missile doesn’t help on farming; but as a more supportive role leveling Homing Missile may increase chance of getting a kill. The situation varies on situation in every match, so don’t get stuck in one single sequence of skill leveling.<br/><br/>Homing Missile is not a spammable skill on a heavily mana-dependent hero as Gyrocopter, and it is not an effective harass skill in lower levels. The rule of thumb is to only cast the spell when someone comes to help you gank.<br/><br/>Try casting Homing Missile where the enemy has no vision, e.g. behind the tree lines so you could surprise enemy when they actually notice and have little time to run away.<br/><br/>Because Homing Missile has a three-second stop before it starts to move, it is best to cast before the gank initiates – or the enemy could easily run away from the missile, and when it finally hits the target no allies could reach the enemy. On the other hand, the long stun and vision the missile provides gives chance for global skills, e.g. Sun Strike, Nature’s Wrath, to finish out the enemy.<br/><br/>In a team fight, it is best to cast the spell on casters with channeling skills, e.g. Freezing Field and Death Ward. The missile could interrupt the spell if placed early and hinder their judgment to cast their spells. Remember to check whether they have Black King Bar before using this strategy!<br/><br/>Homing Missile has little effect for heroes with innate spell immunity or dodge skills, e.g. Lifestealer, Juggernaut and Puck. However, the missile could force out BKB on enemy carries to avoid being stunned in dangerous places, causing them to have no spell immune in immediate teamfights.<br/><br/>Use it to finish the Enemy off.<br/><h4>Flak Cannon</h4>Flak Cannon acts as a lane-pushing and farming skill, similar to Sleight of Fist (without attack effects), but with a certain amount of time and a relatively high cooldown.<br/>Flak Cannon could be used to harass enemy in lane at a cost of pushing the lane. Asking supports to pull creeps can mitigate the problem and give the enemy a disadvantage. <br/><br/>Flak Cannon has a 1000 search radius: when a low-health enemy gets out of range, it is possible by activating the skill and attack a nearby creep to finish off.<br/><br/>Using Helm of the Dominator to hire a creep or asking supports to pull neutral camps, especially ancient camps, and clear them up using Flak Cannon could give Gyrocopter a significant gold advantage over enemy carries.<br/><br/>By increasing Gyrocopter’s attack damage, the spell can inflict absurd amount of damage on summoned units and squishy supports, forcing them to back off. However, Flak Cannon has a 30 second cooldown and will not hit units in Fog of War. Unawareness of the timing may cause the spell on cooldown or used with no enemies around in teamfights, wasting its great damage potential.<br/><br/>Flak Cannon does not apply most of attack effects, e.g. Crits and cold attack, however it does provide true strike when holding Monkey King Bar. Because of this, players usually purchase Monkey King Bar over Daedalus.<br/><br/><h4>Call Down</h4>Call Down is Gyrocopter’s greatest teamfight ability. It provides a AoE slow and damage in a large area, forcing enemy to back off to avoid the negative effects. Its low cooldown ensures that it could be used in every single teamfight or gank.<br/>Call Down provides vision of the targeted area. Together with its large area it could prevent jukes.<br/><br/>Beware of its 2 second delay: enemy could simply run away if they see your cast animation. The red indicator is only visible to allies, so it is better to predict the enemy’s movement and drop the bomb right on time, or cast it together with control on allies or your Homing Missile.<br/><br/>Call Down synergies with area control, e.g. Chronosphere or Ravage. Try to communicate with your teammates so the spell could be used at its best.<br/><br/>In fact, Gyrocopter relies on his ultimate so much that he has little teamfight availability until he gets his ult. Keep this in mind and gain your level as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>The slow does not penetrate spell immunity, and the damage of the spell falls off late game. Thus it is crucial to keep Gyrocopter farmed to keep its teamfight advantage.<br/><br/>Call Down could be used to clear creep waves later in the game and stacked camps together with Flak Cannon to increase Gyrocopter’s farming speed.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango gives Gyrocopter regen to counter early harassment.<br/><br/>Healing Salve gives a helpful burst heal to help stay in lane.<br/><br/>Iron Branch gives cheap early stats, and can be consumed with a tango for extra regen.<br/><br/>Faerie Fire helps with last hits.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility gives a decent agility boost.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Boots of Speed quickly can allow Gyrocopter to get early kills with his Rocket Barrage.<br/><br/>Magic Stick can save Gyrocopter in a pinch.<br/><br/>Wraith Band gives good early stats.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll can save Gyrocopter or help him assist another lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Ring of Aquila gives cheap damage and a modest amount of Mana Regen to allow him to use Flak Cannon more often.<br/><br/>Phase Boots give extra damage for Flak Cannon and makes it as an escape mechanism or chasing heroes to get a kill.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance greatly improves Gyrocopter's short attack range and offers cost efficient stats.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is usually needed to make full use of Flak Cannon without being interrupted.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:.</b><br/>Hurricane Pike is a natural extension to Dragon Lance, giving Gyrocopter more mobility, and can be used to push the Homing Missile to hit the target faster.<br/><br/>Morbid Mask is a cheap way to keep his health up during jungling, and provides a modest amount of damage too.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator gives Gyrocopter a source of health regen, and many neutral creeps have useful auras to make farming and pushing easier.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can be purchased for ganking or escape purposes, and can be upgraded to Silver Edge to counter troublesome passive abilities.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter allows Gyrocopter to continue attacking even when disabled, and gives more attacks which can proc attack modifiers.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha provides a good mix of tankiness and chasing ability.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel helps Gyrocopter be present at every fight.<br/><br/>Manta Style is good for pushing, and disjointing projectiles.<br/><br/><br/><b>Extension items:</b><br/>Satanic is the natural supplemental item to make Gyrocopter with multiple damage items able to survive longer in late-game teamfights, while also providing a decent damage boost itself.<br/><br/>Daedalus multiplies well with Flak Cannon, increasing Gyrocopter's damage significantly. It also gives him a chance on inflicting critical hits on his primary target.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar gives Gyrocopter a strong damage source, which also provides a chance to mini-bash and gives his main attack and attacks from Flak Cannon True Strike.<br/><br/>Butterfly's evasion makes Gyrocopter significantly harder to take down, and allows him to go head to head against harder carries.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is the be-all end-all in terms of damage for Gyrocopter. In combination with Flak Cannon it can decimate the entire enemy team within seconds. But it is also a risky purchase and should only be bought when Gyrocopter is sufficiently tanky or as a last resort in dealing with an overwhelming enemy advantage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Juggernaut is a formidable swordsman capable of engaging and cutting down single enemies without much risk to himself. A medium carry, Juggernaut can support his teammates with Healing Ward, and escape dangerous situations with Blade Fury. In a one-on-one fight, Juggernaut's Omnislash is the most powerful single target ability in the game, usually killing his opponent if no other enemies are around to absorb the damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High single target damage.<br/><br/>Strong mid game presence.<br/><br/>Can play aggressively in lane.<br/><br/>Farms quickly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Weak against multiple targets.<br/><br/>Falls off against hard carries in the late game.<br/><br/>Somewhat fragile.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Juggernaut is usually played in the safe lane, with a support.<br/><br/>Juggernaut can opt to go for a farming route, emphasizing his late game damage output. This requires an early Battle Fury.<br/><br/>Juggernaut can also go for a higher single target damage/Omnislash route, building items like Aghanim's Scepter or Desolator.<br/><br/>Juggernaut excels in the mid game, where he can pick off enemies easily with Omnislash. Try to gain a dominant footing during this time.<br/><br/>In the late game, harder carries like Spectre or Anti-Mage will surpass Juggernaut.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Blade Fury</h4>While Blade Fury does no damage to towers, Juggernaut can still autoattack while using it. The small white flashes in the middle of the tower indicate his attacks landing.<br/><h4>Healing Ward</h4>One point in Healing Ward is useful to help Juggernaut stay in lane against heavy harassment.<br/>Soul Ring is sometimes purchased for this reason, so Juggernaut can use the Healing Ward constantly.<br/><br/><br/>Put down Healing Ward before a teamfight to keep your team alive.<br/>Keep in mind Juggernaut's low mana. Placing a Healing Ward may make him unable to use Omnislash.<br/><br/><br/>Place the Healing Ward slightly off to the side of your team to prevent it from being instantly destroyed by ranged enemies like Sniper.<br/><br/>Set a hotkey, or have Healing Ward follow you or another teammate for easier control.<br/><br/>Use Healing Ward to help Juggernaut and his teammates retreat from a bad situation.<br/><br/>Use Healing Ward when attacking towers or Roshan to negate the incoming damage, and secure what would otherwise be a dangerous position.<br/><br/>The Healing Ward moves slightly faster than most heroes, meaning it can be sent out ahead of Juggernaut to help an ailing ally.<br/><br/>The Healing Ward can be used to scout ahead, up high ground, and into the Roshan Pit. This tactic is highly situational, as the Healing Ward is quite precious and should not be expended lightly.<br/><br/>Remember to move the Healing Ward even after Juggernaut is dead to keep teammates healed.<br/><h4>Blade Dance</h4>Blade Dance benefits most from items that increase raw damage.<br/><br/>The critical damage from Blade Dance is insignificant until Juggernaut has a few items, meaning it can be leveled after other abilities.<br/><h4>Omnislash</h4>An injured Juggernaut lures an overzealous Sven away from lane creeps, using Blade Fury to avoid being disabled. Once the enemy is alone, Juggernaut turns the tables with Omnislash.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango provide healing to keep Juggernaut alive in the lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Juggernaut if used at the last moment.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Juggernaut to regain mana from early usage of Blade Fury.<br/><br/>Iron Branch increases Juggernaut's survivability and mana pool. Because of Juggernaut's low mana pool, an early Iron Branch gives the possibility of casting both Blade Fury and Omnislash back to back. It can later be upgraded into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility gives Juggernaut additional damage, allowing him to get easier last hits and denies in lane. They can later be upgraded to a Poor Man's Shield.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give a passive speed boost, offering better escape and catch-up. They can later be built into Phase Boots.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield helps Juggernaut against harassment, and saves up space while retaining the +6 agility from the Slippers of Agility.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a useful burst healing/mana item if the enemies in lane cast many spells. It can later be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Bracer gives a minor attributes bonus and builds into a drum later.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots provide even more mobility with the Phase ability, and increases his damage significantly. The bonus movement speed is helpful when catching enemy heroes while using Blade Fury.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is good for burst health and mana while providing bonus attributes compared to the Magic Stick.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance provides a great attribute bonus for its price as well as bonus movement speed and attack speed. It not only allows easier catch up when using Blade Fury, but the increased mana pool allows Juggernaut to cast Blade Fury multiple times before returning to the fountain.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter increases the number of Omnislash jumps, while also vastly improving the ability to gank and participate in team fights. In addition, it also increases Juggernaut's health pool and provides a significant attribute bonus.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll are essential for cross-map transportation. TP scrolls allow Juggernaut to return to lane quicker after a death, meaning he misses out on less experience in the lane. They can also be used to quickly jump into a fight or defend a tower in a different lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Sange and Yasha is a fair pick on Juggernaut, since he does not have any gap-closing abilities. This item provides a good strength, agility, movement and attack speed bonus and helps chase better. The Greater Maim helps slowing down fleeing enemies. Maim can even occur while attacking during Blade Fury, despite attacks dealing no damage.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is useful as an escape item or initiation as Juggernaut's Omnislash requires a fairly close range. It can also be used while Omnislash is in effect to catch other enemies too far for Omnislash's basic range.<br/><br/>Butterfly gives an enormous boost to his damage, attack speed, and armor, as well as having the ability to evade physical attacks. It greatly increasing the physical damage Juggernaut can take, while Blade Fury protects against the magical damage. The increased attack speed also allows Blade Dance to occur more frequently.<br/><br/>Desolator reduces the target's armor, increasing the damage from Juggernaut's regular attacks and Omnislash. It can also be effective for pushing since this effect works on towers.<br/><br/>Battle Fury is an item that can be very strong to buy: it can be used to farm quickly, clear lane creeps, and it can greatly increase Juggernaut's damage in team fights. The bonus health regeneration is helpful when jungling, and the bonus mana regeneration allows Juggernaut to use Blade Fury with less worry about mana.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a handy item to have for supporting the team, granting several bonuses including lifesteal. This is also an effective way to sustain in the jungle.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is helpful when the enemy team has more magical damage than Blade Fury can protect. Unlike Blade Fury, the Black King Bar also allows Juggernaut to attack while active, and has a maximum duration of 10 seconds.<br/><br/>Satanic is an excellent late game pick-up. Satanic's large strength boost, armor, and Active ability mesh very well with Juggernaut's high attack speed, vastly enhancing his survivability in team fights.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lone Druid is an adaptive carry who controls a durable Spirit Bear to wreak havoc on the battlefield. With two separate item inventories, the pair acts like two complimentary heroes that can be played a number of ways: with Lone Druid providing buffs from the back while the Spirit Bear fights on the front lines, or with Lone Druid attacking from long range while the Spirit Bear scouts and split pushes. This arrangement allows the Lone Druid to stay on the fringes of conflict, thus risking his own life less than most other carries. However, if the Spirit Bear falls in battle, the Lone Druid himself becomes significantly less effective. Because of the micro-management needed to control the Spirit Bear, Lone Druid can be a daunting hero for newer players.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Faster pusher and building destroyer.<br/><br/>Strong at early-mid game fights.<br/><br/>Scales well into the late game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Few realistic options for increasing Spirit Bear's durability.<br/><br/>Requires a moderate amount of micro skill.<br/><br/>Often highly dependent on his Spirit Bear.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lone Druid is most dominant in the mid-game. Try to gain an advantage during this period.<br/><br/>If a match goes late, Lone Druid should consider building more damage on his bear, making his bear as powerful as he is.<br/><br/>Lone Druid can be played with very little micro, but in order to be of maximum effectiveness the bear must be controlled separately, almost as a second hero.<br/><br/>Lone Druid can use his bear to pick up runes, you can send the bear to easily steal the enemy bounty rune while you stay in lane.<br/><br/>The Spirit Bear can buy and deliver items and act as personal courier if you either cannot get to the shop yourself or it is too much of a risk to send a courier.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Summon Spirit Bear</h4>The Spirit Bear is extremely durable, and can be used to tank lane creeps and jungle creeps in the early game.<br/><br/>An early Orb of Venom or Blight Stone on the Spirit Bear makes him very adept at harassing lane opponents.<br/><br/>When killed, the Spirit Bear gives a very large bounty of gold and experience to the enemy, similar to losing a hero. Do not let your bear die.<br/><br/>If you suspect an upcoming engagement, you can use the bear to scout and use its Return to keep it from dying.<br/><br/>The Spirit Bear can deny Lone Druid, and vice versa.<br/><br/>When retreating, use the Spirit Bear to slow down chasing enemies with Entangle.<br/>Remember that Lone Druid takes 10% of his max health as damage if Spirit Bear dies.<br/><br/>The Spirit Bear can be denied to prevent the enemy from getting the gold bounty, and it also prevents the Backlash damage.<br/><br/><br/>Send the Spirit Bear out to push and attack buildings, especially up the high ground to hit tier 3 towers.<br/><br/>Unlike heroes, the Spirit Bear's does not gain stats. This means it will not be able to fight hard carries during the late game.<br/><br/>If the Spirit Bear is about to die in a teamfight, you can try to transfer its items to Lone Druid so he can continue the fight.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the Spirit Bear's damage type is basic, meaning that its attack damage is reduced by 25% when attacking heroes and creep-heroes.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Rabid</h4>Rabid's low cooldown and mana cost means the Lone Druid can keep the buff on almost all the time. Level 4 Rabid has a 100% up-time.<br/><br/>Use Rabid to help the Spirit Bear catch up to a fleeing enemy and catch them with Entangle.<br/><br/>Rabid can be used both offensively and defensively. If you have to run away, Rabid's speed buff is most likely to allow you to escape a gank or a teamfight if the enemies don't have lockdowns.<br/><br/>Unlike Battle Cry, Rabid does not affect any other units under Lone Druid's control besides the Spirit Bear.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Savage Roar</h4>To save an outnumbered ally, send out the Spirit Bear and use Savage Roar to scatter the enemy.<br/><br/>Use Savage Roar to push enemies into your allies.<br/><br/>Send the Spirit Bear into the Roshan Pit, and use Savage Roar to interrupt enemies attacking Roshan.<br/><br/>Savage Roar can be used to disrupt other taunt spells if it is used after them.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>True Form</h4>True Form is usually leveled much later than other ultimate abilities, either due to Lone Druid's reliance on his Spirit Bear, or because his build is designed to attack at range with Druid Form.<br/><br/>Spirit Form has a cast time, during which Lone Druid cannot move. Be careful when using it while retreating, as the transform time could allow enemies to catch up with Lone Druid.<br/><br/>Transform into bear form before a fight to make Lone Druid more durable.<br/><br/>Transform into bear form in an emergency to save Lone Druid by gaining extra health.<br/><br/>Transform just before a projectile hits to disjoint it.<br/><br/>Although Lone Druid is much tankier in his bear form, he is usually not strong enough to last long in an intense fight, especially if his Spirit Bear has half of his items.<br/><br/>Transforming into human form makes Lone Druid move faster, but will greatly reduce his maximum health.<br/>When retreating, only transform back to human form when no enemies are close enough to kill or disable Lone Druid.<br/><br/><br/>True Form lowers Lone Druid's Base Attack Time, effectively increasing his attack speed and making all his attack speed items more effective.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango keeps Lone Druid in lane.<br/><br/>Iron Branch gives Lone Druid a few extra stats.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can be used to heal the Spirit Bear.<br/><br/>Circlet can be built into a Magic Wand later on.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Boots of Speed is needed on all heroes. Sometimes, Lone Druid will not upgrade his boots in favor of spending money on the Spirit Bear.<br/><br/>Magic Stick can save Lone Druid in a pinch.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots will give Lone Druid very fast move speed when used with Rabid.<br/><br/>Magic Wand can save Lone Druid in a pinch.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering's lifesteal aura helps Lone Druid and his Spirit Bear farm, and increases their damage.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila is very efficient stats for early game, it also give you the mana regen needed to cast Rabid while jungling or while in lane.<br/><br/>Dragon Lancewhen used with his attack range talent gives Lone Druid incredible range for fights and tower sieges<br/><br/>Mjollnir can deal large amounts of damage with Rabid's attack speed buff, and let Lone Druid farm and push very fast.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Boots of Travel is an excellent late game item for quick pushes.<br/><br/>Vanguard makes Lone Druid harder to kill, and is eventually built into Abyssal Blade.<br/><br/>Skull Basher helps Lone Druid lock down enemies, and syngerizes well with the Spirit Bear's Entangle.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade keeps enemies immobilized, and works well in addition to Spirit Bear's Entangle.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter allows the Spirit Bear to attack no matter how far away he is from Lone Druid, making it a more efficient farmer and pusher.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight makes both Lone Druid and his Spirit Bear tankier against magic damage.<br/><br/>Blade Mail discourages enemies from attack Lone Druid, forcing them to focus on the Spirit Bear.<br/><br/><br/><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Stout Shield helps Spirit Bear tank creeps.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade helps Spirit Bear kill creeps.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Boots of Speed makes Spirit Bear move faster.<br/><br/>Iron Talon helps greatly in farming during the early game.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is excellent for harassing and catching enemies.<br/><br/>Blight Stone slightly increases your damage early, and can be built into Desolator late game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots provides damage, and helps the Spirit Bear run down enemies and catch them with Entangle.<br/><br/>Radiance greatly increases the Spirit Bear's damage, as its high health allows it to stay in the center of fights. It also makes up for the Spirit Bear's lack of stat gain.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Desolator lets the bear push extremely fast because of Demolish paired with Desolator's armor reduction on buildings.<br/><br/>Maelstrom increases attack speed, damage and push speed. Can be upgraded into Mjollnir.<br/><br/>Hand of Midas is easily picked up with proper jungling, and helps the Spirit Bear snowball into the late game, but only purchase it if you can afford a weaker early game.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass's attack speed greatly benefits the Spirit Bear, and synergizes well with Rabid and True Form's base attack time reduction.<br/><br/>Moon Shard is a valuable luxury item to give the Spirit Bear very high attack speed.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is suitable for the Spirit Bear, as its tankiness keeps him from dying and dropping it. Lone Druid can also pick it up if the Spirit Bear dies.<br/><br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse can be used on the hero or the bear depending on the situation.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere can be used on the hero or the bear depending on the situation.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb can be used on the hero or the bear depending on the situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Luna is a highly offensive carry who can demolish buildings and clear the battlefield in very little time. Along with her flying Moon Glaives, Luna can call upon the goddess Selemene to cover the battlefield in an Eclipse, striking down large numbers of enemies at once. Being a purely offensive hero, Luna suffers from a lack of defensive abilities, and will struggle against carries that are geared towards one-on-one combat.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Hits multiple targets at once.<br/><br/>Fast pusher and farmer.<br/><br/>Good night vision.<br/><br/>High magical damage output during the early game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No escape mechanisms.<br/><br/>No defense mechanisms.<br/><br/>Short attack range.<br/><br/>Item dependent.<br/><br/>Easily kited by high-mobility heroes.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because Luna has no means of escaping ganks, she is usually played in the safe lane, with a support. Her Lunar Blessing increases support's right click damage, making lane harassment easier.<br/><br/>Luna can be played in a solo lane, but this is risky due to her fragility and short attack range.<br/>Solo Luna is usually done to give her a level advantage early on, because Luna can snowball off of an early team fight with Eclipse and catch-up in farm very quickly with Moon Glaives, especially if she managed to stack a couple of jungle camps.<br/><br/><br/>A very odd trait for a hard carry is that Luna gains significant killing power with a level advantage because of Lucent Beam, and by extension Eclipse.<br/><br/>Luna is an extremely potent pusher, especially when attacking barracks, as her Moon Glaives will bounce between multiple buildings with each attack.<br/>Because of this, Luna should be present as often as possible to take down towers with her team.<br/><br/><br/>Any source of lifesteal greatly boosts Luna's survivability in the late game.<br/><br/>Creep stacking is very useful for Luna. Ask an ally to start stacking for you early on.<br/><br/>Tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Lucent Beam</h4>Lucent Beam's cast range is gigantic. Use it to pick off fleeing heroes.<br/><br/>Lucent Beam mini-stuns. Use to interrupt teleporting and channeling heroes.<br/><br/>Lucent Beam has a low cooldown, but should not be spammed too often due to Luna's mediocre mana pool.<br/><br/>From level 2 on, Lucent Beam can be used effectively to harass enemies out of the lane. Build a Ring of Basilius or Infused Raindrop to obtain some form of mana regen in lane.<br/><br/>Use Lucent Beam after Eclipse to keep the target inside Eclipse's radius a little longer.<br/><br/>Lucent Beam is good for last-hitting when you can't/don't want to get near a creep. This is especially true when contesting a big jungle creep with an opponent.<br/><h4>Moon Glaive</h4>Early points in Moon Glaive will push the lane, and is usually not recommended until laning phase has concluded.<br/><br/>Moon Glaive is the ability that allows Luna to clear creeps and demolish buildings extremely quickly.<br/><br/>Moon Glaive has no effect on lone enemies, so try to keep all neutrals and lane creeps at roughly the same HP level when farming.<br/><br/>Occasionally Can be used to attack targets up to 830 range away, for example strike one last time to a fleeing enemy by attacking a tower.<br/><br/>The number of bounces increase by 3 between level 3 and level 4. Assuming the glaives bounce as much as possible, they increase Luna's damage by 65%/107%/135%/172%.<br/><h4>Lunar Blessing</h4>A point or two in Lunar Blessing helps Luna score last hits, especially at level 1.<br/><br/>Lunar Blessing's damage bonus makes a big difference in the early game, when a few auto attacks from Luna's teammates can kill a weaker enemy.<br/><br/>Put one point in Lunar Blessing before the first night, as it will provide Luna with its bonus night vision. It is nearly always crucial to max it fast since Eclipse sets the time to night. That means, upgrading it effectively increases Luna's ultimate's range when alone or without vision.<br/><br/>Lunar Blessing is best to max early in a 5-man strategy when the bonus damage is still relatively high compared to the base damage.<br/><h4>Eclipse</h4>Eclipse has a very long cooldown. Use wisely.<br/><br/>Always underestimate, not overestimate Eclipse's range. It cannot hit ennemies out of vision.<br/><br/>Eclipse is most powerful in early to mid game, and should be taken advantage of.<br/>Because of this, Eclipse can be considered an early game ganking ability.<br/><br/><br/>Against weaker opponents, you may get a kill (or two) while pushing a tower. If they TP to defend it and there are no enemy creeps, they've just set themselves up for Eclipse's full blast.<br/><br/>While a full Eclipse deals tremendous damage, experienced enemies will usually save their escape mechanisms precisely to avoid this.<br/>Disables, slows, Force Staff, and movement abilities like Blink will allow enemies to move out of Eclipse's range.<br/><br/>In the late game, Eclipse deals less damage, as many heroes will have Black King Bar.<br/><br/><br/>Use Eclipse in narrow or confined spaces to make sure enemies don't move out of its radius.<br/><br/>Use Eclipse near a single enemy to deal heavy damage.<br/>A level one Eclipse will usually kill a solitary target during the early game.<br/><br/><br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Eclipse has an enormous cast range and can be cast on the ground or an ally unit.<br/>Use upgraded Eclipse on your team's initiator to deal more damage. This keeps Luna out of harm's way while still doing damage with Eclipse. Note that Eclipse ends when the targeted ally dies in this case.<br/><br/>Use upgraded Eclipse on the ground in front of allied towers to defend the tower, or behind enemy towers while pushing.<br/><br/>Use upgraded Eclipse on an invisible ally and let them wreak havoc for you.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Iron Branches give some good starting attributes, and can be built into Magic Wand at a later time.<br/><br/>Circlet can be built into a variety of early game items for Luna, including Magic Wand, Ring of Aquila, or Drum of Endurance.<br/><br/>Tango give Luna some starting health regeneration, allowing her to trade hits with enemies in lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve allows Luna regenerate almost her entire health pool in the early game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Stick helps Luna survive against heroes that constantly cast spells.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are core on any hero for extra move speed in order to chase and to escape.<br/><br/>Power Treads are the boots of choice for Luna, their attributes and attack speed are helpful throughout the game.<br/><br/>Phase Boots are the alternative boot of choice, it trades survivability and attack speed for more raw damage and additional movement speed.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila gives Luna a bit of damage, mana regeneration, and other attributes that are helpful throughout the early and mid-game.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is helpful to quickly enter fights from across the map. Luna is one of the carries that can turn the tide of battle thanks to Eclipse.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is good on most heroes in order to get some bonus burst health as well as bonus stats.<br/><br/><br/><b>Mid Game Items:</b><br/>Dragon Lance is among the most cost-effective items in the game, providing 12 strength and agility at a very reasonable price. The range increase is particularly nice on Luna since her own range is poor and she has no mobility tools to help her get in reach of enemies except her high movement speed. The item is also useful for early-mid game pushing and fighting.<br/><br/>Yasha increases Luna's movement speed as well as attack speed and damage, and can be upgraded to Manta Style later.<br/><br/>Manta Style is the core item in most games on Luna giving her damage, health, and bonus move speed. Since Manta Style's illusions also obtain Moon Glaive passive, they are very useful for pushing and extra damage.<br/><br/>Black King Bar helps Luna's damage and survivability with Magic Immunity and Strength if the enemy team mainly uses magic damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Late Game Items:</b><br/>Butterfly is great mixtures of heavy damage and survivability, giving Luna bonus attack speed, damage, armor, and evasion. Butterfly's active flutter also can help chase enemy heroes at the end of a fight.<br/><br/>Satanic gives Luna some much-needed survivability, offering Luna a burst heal to live through immense amounts of damage in fights.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar's damage allows Luna's glaives to deal more damage. It is a great counter to enemies with evasion.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Hurricane Pike is a situational upgrade of Dragon Lance if some form of escaping or chasing tool is needed.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi provides great stats all around and the slow effect fully stacks with the lifesteal from your Helm of the Dominator or Satanic. Note that your Manta Style's illusions benefits from the stats as well.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter increases the max single target damage of Eclipse. It is great when your team has a powerful initiator such as Faceless Void and the enemy team has few way to dodge a long distance Eclipse. And of course, Alchemist can farm one for you.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is a situational item for powerful single-target initiations. Luna doesn't usually have the slot for Linken's Sphere since Black King Bar is crucial most of the times.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is an alternative item of Manta Style, which provides larger HP pool and a maim effect. It is useful when illusions have little effect in this game,<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can grant Luna a critical escape. Eclipse also continues to work when Luna is invisible, allowing you to chase down enemy heroes with bonus move speed and invisibility. It also upgrades into Silver Edge.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger provide the availability for Luna to counter initiate with Eclipse as well as the ability to chase, escape and farm efficiently.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness is a risky pick on a fragile hero like Luna, but it will help her farm the jungle at an outstanding speed.<br/><br/>Daedalus and Bloodthorn are alternative choices of Monkey King Bar. The former for more damage (Note that Moon Glaive doesn't benefit from critical strike), the latter for a single target lockdown.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is the last resort for damage in a desperate scenario, as Moon Glaive benefits from raw damage item and could possibly inflict massive damage to enemy team.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Medusa is a very hard carry who can easily turn teamfights around in her favor. Her Mana Shield makes her one of the tankiest carries in the game, but her extreme item dependence requires her to farm for much of the game before she can be effective in teamfights. Split Shot allows her to farm really fast in the jungle and deal considerable damage to multiple heroes in fights. However, her early game is filled with problems, such as having the lowest base HP in the game, very little mana, and slow movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very powerful in late game.<br/><br/>Effective against multiple opponents.<br/><br/>Great crowd control.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow movement speed<br/><br/>Very fragile in early game.<br/><br/>Extremely item dependent.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Medusa has one of the lowest base health in the game, making her quite vulnerable in the early game.<br/><br/>Medusa is arguably the hardest carry in the game, but also the most item dependent. Knowing how to farm well is the most important aspect of playing her.<br/><br/>Early on, Medusa should just focus on farming and surviving. Once you get Mana Shield, you'll have a lot more survivability in lane, but always keep an eye on the minimap for incoming ganks and your health and mana pools to see how much damage the enemies are doing.<br/><br/>In the late game, Mana Shield and Stone Gaze allows Medusa to withstand much more punishment than most carries.<br/>Enemy teams who cannot kill Medusa quickly enough will often lose the teamfight.<br/><br/>Because of this, a well farmed late game Medusa can often turn a losing match around.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Split Shot</h4>Split Shot makes you a really good farmer and pusher, especially once you get more levels in it. Use it to quickly farm jungle camps or push lanes to try to take early towers<br/>When pushing towers with Split Shot, keep the tower as your main target, and the other arrows will hit creeps or nearby enemies. If you target creeps while trying to push, the extra arrows won't hit towers.<br/><br/><br/>Split Shot also gives you immense damage during fights. While Medusa's single target damage isn't much for a lot of the game, with Split Shot you can easily deal decent damage to each enemy in a fight.<br/><br/>Keep in mind activating this ability reduces the damage of your attacks by 20%. Remember to turn this off when facing single targets or just deal more damage to certain enemies.<br/><br/>Split Shots works on Medusa's illusions, but only if it is active when the illusions are spawned. Spawn illusions with Split Shot on to increase their DPS and pushing power.<br/><br/>It is possible to farm ancients with Medusa at level 1 by putting a point into Split Shot. However, it requires juking into the jungle, and may need more skill to perform in on the Dire ancients.<br/><h4>Mystic Snake</h4>Mystic Snake is potent throughout all points of the game. It lets you harass enemies and keep your mana nearly full while posing minimum risk to yourself<br/><br/>For maximum damage against enemies in lane, try to bounce the snake off a few creeps into the enemy hero.<br/><br/>The mana steal works against heroes and creeps to the full extent. Use this in the jungle to keep Mana Shield's EHP from dropping too low so you can tank hits from creeps. Medium Satyr and Mud Golem camps work the best for this.<br/><br/>Mystic Snake deals Pure damage to enemies petrified by Stone Gaze, so be sure to cast it after activating Stone Gaze.<br/><br/>Both in lane and in the jungle, take advantage of Mystic Snake to keep your mana up so Mana Shield keeps you alive.<br/><br/>Mystic Snake can be maxed first as it is Medusa's only nuke and can be used to push your lane.<br/><br/>Mystic Snake's damage increases per jump, so it is best cast so that it would hit enemy heroes at last, to make them take the most damage. If used for farming, casting it so that it hits the creeps with more health can prevent overkill damage on lower health creeps, making it more effective and faster to farm.<br/><br/>Since Medusa does not have much mana and the ability has a high mana cost, it is important to make sure that it hits at least 2 enemies which have mana (e.g. ranged lane creeps), to get some mana restored back. It does not matter if targets with mana are hit as first or at last, since the mana drain is static and does not increase per jump like the damage.<br/><br/>Lane creeps have a mana pool of 500, so Mystic Snake can drain 55/70/85/100 mana from them. So in order to get its full mana cost basically refunded, it has to hit at least 3/3/2/2 ranged lane creeps. This means it is also important to hit enemies with the spell in order to not run out of mana during the laning phase.<br/><br/>In order to refund the full mana cost, Mystic Snake must hit units with a sum of 1273/1072/942/850 total mana.<br/><br/>Use Mystic Snake on a nearby creep to have it bounce and hit an enemy that's out of range.<br/><h4>Mana Shield</h4>One point in Mana Shield gives you the full 60% damage reduction. Subsequent levels just lower the mana lost per damage.<br/><br/>Level Mana Shield based on what the enemy has. If enemies have items such as Diffusal Blade, grabbing more points may not be a bad idea to lower the overall mana lost from it.<br/><br/>Even if you do level Mana Shield up early, be wary of enemies who tend to build illusions with mana burn, such as Anti-Mage with his Mana Break and Manta Style illusions.<br/><br/>Medusa's mana pool needs to equal at least 93.75%/78.95%/68.18%/60% of her current health to maximize the damage reduction of Mana Shield, assuming she does not lose mana in any different way than by the absorption of Mana Shield.<br/><br/>Be wary about leaving Mana Shield active in the early game without a high mana pool or some mana regen items. Heavy damage may leave you unable to cast Stone Gaze, which can turn the tides of a gank or teamfight when used correctly.<br/><br/>Mana Shield does, however, provide an immense amount of damage reduction at all levels. An alternative build is to max this by 7 and take a lot of points in stats.<br/><br/>The ideal ratio of mana to health is 0.94/0.79/0.68/0.6 mana per health, meaning every consecutive skill point in Mana Shield becomes less cost efficient, consider grabbing a point in your other skill points over another point in mana shield if you already have the ideal mana/health ratio (any more points basically mean wasted mana; do not forget about Stone Gaze and Mystic Snake costs)<br/><h4>Stone Gaze</h4>Leveling Stone Gaze only increases the duration by 1 second each level. As such, one value point early on should be enough for both escaping ganks and turning the tides in team fights.<br/><br/>Stone Gaze goes through Magic Immunity, meaning the only way to escape it is to turn away from the Medusa. It'll even freeze a Puck who used Phase Shift and take them out of the Phase, so use that to your advantage.<br/><br/>Mystic Snake deals pure damage to enemies who have been turned to stone by Stone Gaze. Considering that Mystic Snake also increases damage per jump, you can deal massive nuking damage if you bounce it correctly after ulting.<br/><br/>Proper use of Stone Gaze together with Split Shot makes Medusa a great counter to heroes that depend on illusions.<br/>However, be very wary with its activation - smart users may attempt to use illusions to bait you either by taking you to poor spots or by forcing your ultimate out, which can leave you very vulnerable, especially to heroes like Phantom Lancer as they almost always build Diffusal Blade (making your mana shield much less effective) and he can easily overwhelm you beyond your capacities even with Split Shot active.<br/><br/><br/>Remember that Petrified heroes take no damage from magical attacks. This is especially important if you have a nuke heavy team as activating Stone Gaze at the wrong time can cost your team a battle that could have been won otherwise.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Tangoes for recovering hit points especially when received significant damage early on.<br/><br/>Healing Salve gives you a 400 HP heal, which a large amount of Medusa's early game HP.<br/><br/>Iron Branches provides early stats needed for last-hitting creeps and a small boost in your hit points and mana.<br/><br/>Circlet gives you plenty of stats and lets you pick up a Magic Wand at the side shop. On top of that, planted Iron Branches increase the total healing from Tangoes.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection to compensate Medusa having the lowest base hit points.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game Items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is one of the most cost effective EHP items on Medusa early on, as storing charges can give you a huge burst health and mana for when things get rough.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius provides mana regeneration, armor bonus and a small damage boost for last-hitting.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Phase Boots give movement speed, even boosted with the Phase ability for escaping ambushes early game. The additional damage also contributes to her Split Shot skill. It also helps her position herself better for a successful Stone Gaze, as her otherwise low mobility can make this difficult.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila is the upgraded version of Ring of Basilius which gives stats and further damage boost.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives both survivability and killing power, and slowing enemies. The added stats grant Medusa health, mana for Mana Shield.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is crucial to escape early game ganks, which can be devastating against Medusa due to her high item dependence.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Hurricane Pike gives attack range, damage and overall stats - very effective item for Medusa.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere can be purchased before or after Eye of Skadi. If fights are not in your favor early on, you're farming rather slowly, or enemies have stuns to keep you down fights, consider a Linken's Sphere.<br/><br/>Butterfly offers bonus damage, attack speed and armor, and its evasion gives you even more survivability.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar can be needed if the enemies have evasion items or heroes.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is the best damage item on Medusa. She's tanky enough that, even with Mask of Madness, the odds of her dropping this are extremely slim, and it'll help you massacre a whole team with Split Shot. That being said, if against heroes that can burn through your Mana Shield like no tomorrow, it may be too risky to consider this unless absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>Manta Style's bonus directly increases Medusa's movement speed, and the illusions hit for a total of 56% of your base damage. In addition, the illusions can be used to farm multiple places at once, and benefit from Split Shot.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a great cost effective stat item on Medusa. It gives her both Intelligence and Strength which is needed on her, and the slight movement and attack speed it gives are great for farming or pushing.<br/><br/>Maelstrom into Mjollnir can be considered if the enemies have a lot of heroes with illusions.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse for an extra disable, stats and mana regeneration which may help Mana Shield.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is an item to be considered if the enemy is keeping you locked down before you can get Stone Gaze off.<br/><br/>Bloodthorn, while expensive, is a great luxury item on Medusa. The mana it gives will make you even tankier than before, and it effectively gives you a Crystalys and Monkey King Bar in one slot.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness is good for increasing your farming speed and being slightly active in the mid game. Her Mana Shield pretty much negates the increase in damage taken from it, it gives her the movement speed and attack speed she needs for both farming and team fights, and it lets her be active early on.<br/><br/>Moon Shard boosts attack speed further which is very handy as the game goes longer.<br/><br/>Satanic should be picked up when building Divine Rapier. Due to the extremely high damage provided by Divine Rapier, Satanic's passive lifesteal and its active skill become very effective in terms of healing yourself, decreasing the chances of dropping the Rapier.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Meepo is one of the most unique heroes in all of Dota, with the ability to split into up to five bodies. While he requires intensive micro-management, once mastered Meepo is capable of farming, pushing and ganking (maybe all at once) more successfully than most other heroes in the game. Earthbind allows Meepo to trap an enemy for an extended period of time, as all of Meepo's clones share individual cooldowns on abilities. Poof allows his clones to teleport to other clones, including the original Meepo, while also doing considerable amounts of damage, especially when several Meepos use it at the same time.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has up to 5 independent bodies.<br/><br/>Very fast farmer.<br/><br/>Sheer numbers overwhelms enemies.<br/><br/>Can disable enemies repeatedly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very vulnerable against area nuke abilities.<br/><br/>Very micro-intensive.<br/><br/>Very hard to play.<br/><br/>Requires lots of farm to be effective.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>With his ultimate, Meepo is the fastest farmer in the game. Played correctly, Meepo should have a large level advantage compared all other players in the game.<br/><br/>Meepo's clones have higher pitched voice responses compared to the original Meepo. Use this as an audio cue to determine which Meepo is selected.<br/><br/>You can bind a shortcut to each Meepo by doing Ctrl + a number. Attach the number 2 to 5 to the clones and 1 for the main Meepo, the shortcut will be saved for every game. This allows you to control individual clones with greater ease.<br/><br/>In order to play Meepo well, it is necessary to possess strong micromanagement skills, as well as a powerful sense of map awareness. As each individual clone must be managed and moved around the map, Meepo can potentially be present everywhere on the map and congregate to focus their power when needed. However, at the same time this means that the death of one clone will mean the death of them all, so it is necessary to keep them out of harm's way and to know where it is safe to place the clones.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that despite his higher magic resistance, Meepo is very vulnerable to area disables that can disable multiple clones at a time, as well as area-of-effect spells that deal more damage to grouped up targets like the clones. As well, powerful single-target nukes and Pure damage can make Meepo easy prey against heroes that are able to single out a single clone and burst it down.<br/><br/>Generally, Meepo is played as a mid hero due to his unique ultimate. By getting an early level 3, Meepo can use the clone to help with last-hitting, scout out runes, stack camps, look for ganks and relay back to base for regen by using Poof. The clone augments Meepo's lane presence, and can serve to provide extra nuking and disable power if a support rotates mid to help you gank.<br/><br/>Meepo can also be played as a safe-lane carry, as his low base damage and dependence on levels and farm in order to be effective means that he must be protected by his team. The objective of a safe-lane Meepo is to get level 3 as early as possible, then shuttle the clone to stack and farm jungle camps or serve as a base relay when needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Earthbind</h4>Earthbind is an area-targeted root that allows Meepo and his clones to pin down multiple enemies at a time.<br/><br/>While weak by itself, Earthbind increases linearly in duration with the number of clones available. Since each clone has its own mana and cooldowns, each clone can increase the disable duration by two seconds. With four or more clones, it is possible to keep an enemy permanently rooted to the ground if they do not have spell immunity.<br/><br/>In general, only one level in Earthbind is needed in the early game, as Meepo's skill points are better spent on his nukes and damage output. As well, the only things that scale as Earthbind is leveled up are the cooldown and cast range; decreasing the cooldown does not matter much in the early game since each clone has its own cooldown, and the cast range usually does not matter during early game ganks with assisting disables from allies. The spell only truly becomes powerful when Meepo has enough clones and damage output to make the most of the disable.<br/><br/>While Earthbind has a very slow cast animation and travel speed, it is nonetheless a strong disable since it cannot be blocked by Linken's Sphere, and its low cooldown and long cast range at maximum level allows Meepo to hold down all enemies in its radius indefinitely if he has an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/>Despite not being able to hit invisible enemies, Earthbind will reveal any caught enemies if they go invisible. When combined with detection items, Earthbind becomes a strong counter to abilities like Shukuchi, Shadow Walk and Moonlight Shadow.<br/><br/>In order to reduce the liability of Earthbind's slow windup time, it is best to try to get as close to an enemy as possible before casting Earthbind. When cast at point-blank range, the only delay will be Meepo's cast animation, as the travel time of the net will not factor in.<br/><br/>Conversely, Earthbind's extremely long cast range makes it a powerful disable even at long range. Used properly, Earthbind can catch enemies that are out of range of other disables, even if Meepo does not directly engage the enemy.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that all root disables will prevent True Blinks, Charge of Darkness and Phase Shift from being cast. This makes Earthbind a very strong spell to use against certain heroes that rely on those spells for survivability, such as Anti-Mage, Puck and Queen of Pain.<br/><h4>Poof</h4>Poof is perhaps Meepo's most powerful ability, as it provides linearly scaling nuke damage as well as global mobility on a low cooldown.<br/><br/>Due to its low mana cost and large nuking power, Poof should be maxed out as early as possible. While weak by itself, the damage increases tremendously as more clones become available, and the spell allows Meepo to have a global presence with enough clones.<br/><br/>Poof's damage is dealt twice, once at Meepo's starting location and again at the destination. As well, Poof can target itself, so a Meepo can Poof in place to deal twice the listed damage around himself. The most efficient way to utilize Poof is to always ensure that there are enemies at both the jump-off and arrival locations, so that damage is dealt at both ends.<br/><br/>The key to utilizing Poof effectively is to have Meepos spread out across the map. If it is necessary to bring full force to bear at any one location, all Meepos can Poof to that location; if escape is necessary, the endangered Meepo is guaranteed to have a different Meepo to arrive at.<br/><br/>If a Meepo is in danger, usually the best way to survive is to simply Poof to another Meepo. Unless the enemy has long-duration silences, chain disables, or a tremendous amount of damage output, they will usually be unable to kill a Meepo inside of its 1.5 second cast animation.<br/><br/>Remember that the target of a Poof is chosen at the end of the cast animation. This can cause the spell to foul up when targeting moving Meepos, as moving the target Meepo too far away from where the spell was targeted can cause it to select a different Meepo to arrive at. Therefore, if your Meepos are grouped close together, try to "lead" Poof and target it at where you expect the destination Meepo will be after 1.5 seconds.<br/><br/>When using Poof for an alpha nuke, remember that it must be cast individually for each Meepo; selecting a group and casting Poof will only cause the first one in that group to cast the spell. Each Meepo must be cycled and individually commanded to cast Poof.<br/><br/>Activating the Quick Cast option when using Poof can make the spell easier to use, as it reduces the delay as well as the number of required key presses to command the clone army to all Poof.<br/><h4>Geostrike</h4>Geostrike drastically increases the attack and disabling power of Meepo as he accrues more clones, as each clone also procs Geostrike.<br/><br/>Next to Poof, Geostrike should be prioritized to level up for Meepo, as each clone will linearly increase its effect. With five Meepos, it is possible to slow an individual target by 100% and deal 200 magical damage per second.<br/><br/>Geostrike is most powerful when all clones are focused on attacking the same target, as they can reduce a target's movement speed down to the minimum possible, effectively trapping them in place.<br/><br/>One aspect of Geostrike is that it is not a Unique Attack Modifier, and it can be shared with illusions. This means that Meepo can build an attack modifier to stack on top of it (note that clones will not gain this modifier), and that illusions can be used alongside clones to further augment the slow and damage.<br/><h4>Divided We Stand</h4>Divided We Stand is Meepo's signature ability, and perhaps the most unique ability in the whole game. It duplicates Meepo, giving him a clone that has its own individual spells, mana and cooldowns.<br/><br/>Unlike other ultimate abilities in the game, Divided We Stand can be skilled as early as at level 3, and subsequently at 10 and 17. This means that unlike other heroes who reach their minimum effectiveness at level 6, Meepo only has to wait until 3 before he starts being active.<br/><br/>The key to playing Meepo effectively is to micromanage the clones and have them accomplish things all across the map simultaneously. For instance, the clones can be individually commanded to stack neutral camps, and then congregated to farm them, all while another Meepo is last-hitting lane creeps. As well, a pair of clones can be used to push a tower, while another pair prepares for a gank. Be creative and always active with the clones, and make sure that you are always doing something with them.<br/><br/>In order to make micromangement easier, it is wise to assign command groups to the Meepos so that a group or each individual clone can be selected instantly at the press of a key. It is possible to cycle though each Meepo individualy, allowing for Blink-Poof combos in conjunction with Meepo Prime. Assigning individuals to single groups allows them to be issued separate commands as needed.<br/><br/>For the purposes of experience, each Meepo clone is regarded as a hero. This allows Meepo to gain levels and farm gold extremely quickly, as each clone's experience is added to Meepo's total, allowing him to gain experience in different parts of the map all at once. While each clone is statistically weak, Meepo can offset this by exploiting these experience mechanics, giving himself more levels (and thus more attributes and stronger abilities from those levels) than heroes on the opposing team.<br/><br/>In general, Meepo's clones are best moved in groups of two or three. Two Meepos can roam and farm jungle camps fairly easily, and provide mutual support when fighting or ganking. If one group runs into an enemy, they have the option of Poofing out to the other group in case of danger, or summoning reinforcements as they engage.<br/><br/>Combined with Poof, clones can act as anchors for keeping all Meepos' HP and mana full. When a Meepo is in the fountain, other weakened Meepos can be sent home as well via Poof, and then return to the battlefield just as quickly. Using Poof to reduce Meepo's turnaround time is crucial to remaining active throughout a match and accomplishing objectives.<br/><br/>Remember to abuse Meepo's global mobility as much as possible, and use that mobility to outmaneuver the enemy. If Meepo has clones in different areas of the map, he can congregate them at any of their locations to best exploit a weakness in the enemies' position. If the enemy team is grouped on or have recently teleported to one side of the map, Poofing a number of clones to the opposite side can allow them to push a lane and threaten to take one of their towers. If a clone happens upon a lone support, instant reinforcements can be summoned for an easy kill. If two of the enemy's cores are spotted attempting to gank a group of clones, the clones can be pulled to safety by Poofing to another group, wasting the enemy's time and movement.<br/><br/>When equipped with a Blink Dagger, Meepo's textbook initiation is: command all clones to Poof on Meepo Prime > Blink Dagger on Meepo Prime to jump on top of target > Earthbind target > Poof on Meepo Prime. If executed quickly enough, the clones will all Poof in on top of Meepo Prime right after he blinks in, dealing tremendous damage to the target and putting them in perfect position to inflict the target with Geostrike and further immobilizing them with follow-up Earthbinds.<br/><br/>In general, Meepo benefits from building raw attribute items in order to make full use of Aghanim's Scepter, and aura items that provide benefits to all Meepos. Items built will generally vary according to the situation.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve provide basic health sustain, allowing Meepo to weather harass damage from his lane opponents.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection gives Meepo additional armor, giving him more resistance to physical damage. As well, it can be upgraded into a Ring of Basilius.<br/><br/>Iron Branch give Meepo cheap attributes, always useful in the early game. The branches can be sold, or built into Mekansm components.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Ring of Basilius is a great pickup in lane as it provides damage for last hitting, a helpful aura that gives his clones mana regeneration and armor in the early game, and builds into Vladmir's Offering.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed gives Meepo much more mobility in the early game, allowing him and his clones to move around more easily.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is useful to have on Meepo at all times, given his ability to mob enemies with his clones. Combined with Poof, Meepo can have a strong global presence since he can spread his clones all around the map and move them to each other as needed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter maximizes the power of Divided We Stand by giving Meepo an extra clone and giving +10 attributes to all clones and prime Meepo.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is extremely powerful on Meepo, given his already formidable global mobility with Poof. As each clone has its own cooldown, Meepo can position any clone anywhere there are friendly buildings or creeps, and use Poof to bring them all to that location, further decreasing his turnaround time.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a very strong initiation item that greatly augments Meepo's mobility and lethality. By combining the Blink with a Poof from all clones, Meepo can offensively cast Poof in order to deal nuke damage and jump himself and his clones on top of an enemy.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Power Treads are the most balanced boots for Meepo, as they provide attack speed and attributes to all Meepos. They can greatly increase Meepo's damage output and allow him to attribute switch as needed to give his clones more health, mana or damage output. Because Meepo clones benefit fully from bonus attributes on Meepo prime, they effectively get twice the attribute boost from Power Treads (from both the shared stats and the Power Treads they carry).<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering gives Meepo a useful aura that greatly benefits his clones. The clones become a much larger threat due to the increased attack damage and bonus armor, increasing their survivability and damage output. The regen keeps their HP and mana topped up, while the lifesteal allows them to keep their HP up while farming.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a farm-intensive but powerful item on Meepo. While the intelligence and mana regen are largely wasted on him, the item provides all-around stats that benefit the clones, and the active gives Meepo an instant hard-disable to use against targets who are too slippery to catch with Earthbind.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque, when purchased on Meepo, it greatly increases the survivability of all of Meepo's clones, as all of them will benefit from the item's strength attribute. This makes each clone much more resilient, allowing Meepo to survive for much longer in fights.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade can be a situationally strong item to purchase on Meepo. As each clone gets the bonus agility, they all gain increased attack speed and base damage, though not the Feedback modifier. The item is good to use combined with Earthbind as the purge slow makes netting a lot easier to execute.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade is a very strong stat item to have on Meepo. It gives 40 agility and 10 strength to each clone, greatly increasing their damage output and granting them more HP. The active can be used to save a clone that's being focused down by physical attacks, or on an enemy to slow them while weakening their magic resistance to deal more damage with Poof.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives Meepo all-around attributes, giving each clone more damage, attack speed, HP and mana. Also increases the potency of Geostrike, allowing Meepo and his clones to slow enemies even more.<br/><br/>Manta Style can be strong on Meepo, but for reasons different from why it is strong on other heroes. The item grants more agility and all-around attributes to all clones, increasing their damage output and survivability. Since Meepo is strong against single-target disables due to his clones still being able to act, the dispel upon Mirror Image is not very useful. However, the illusions will be very strong due to Meepo building attribute items to strengthen his clones, and they can still proc Geostrike, allowing them to increase his damage output even more. Most importantly however, the illusions can be used as decoys to trick the enemy into focusing them down and wasting spells and time, and the illusions are valid targets for Poof, meaning that they can be used as scouts to safely locate enemies to gank and kill.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves is a very unorthodox boots item on Meepo, however it can be powerful under the right circumstances. As it is a boots item, each Meepo benefits from the increased attributes, armor and mana; with Aghanim's Scepter, he can simultaneously benefit from the attributes from the Guardian Greaves on Meepo Prime and from the worn boots, effectively allowing clones to double-dip. As well, the Guardian Aura, which all clones carry regardless of distance from Meepo Prime, greatly increases the survivability of Meepo's clones when they are at low health.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Mirana is a very well-rounded hero who can fill almost any role required by her team. Her array of spells gives her the ability to disable, nuke, push, escape and gank in any number of situations. The teamwide invisibility from her Moonlight Shadow is one of the best ganking tools in the game. Depending on the lineup, Mirana is capable of playing as a carry, semi-carry, roamer, support, and even has minor jungling capabilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very long range stun.<br/><br/>Team invisibility.<br/><br/>Good escape mechanism.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Does not excel at any one role.<br/><br/>Requires good aim.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of her low base strength and mediocre strength growth, Mirana is quite frail unless she builds survivability items; instead, she focuses on leveraging Leap and Moonlight Shadow to give herself and her team mobility and strategic advantages over the enemy, which can transition into victorious ganks and teamfights. As well, her poor intelligence growth means that unless she is built as a support with mana items, she will often have to rely on teammates to provide her with mana via Arcane Boots or mana-replenishing abilities.<br/><br/>Be mindful that with her pitiful base damage and slow missile speed, Mirana often has trouble last-hitting to get gold and experience in the laning stage. When played as a carry, purchasing starting items that boost Mirana's attack damage can greatly aid in last-hitting.<br/><br/>One of carry Mirana's greatest strengths is that, as a ranged agility hero, her physical damage is able to scale well without relying on a Unique Attack Modifier. As such, she is able to build an attack modifier as she sees fit according to the situation.<br/><br/>Mirana's spells can be difficult to use properly due to her long 0.5 second cast animation, almost twice as long as most other heroes. This is especially true for Sacred Arrow, as the cast animation, projectile travel speed and enemy movement must all be taken into account. Be sure to position accordingly and cast ahead of time in order to account for this.<br/><br/>Because both of her escape abilities are spells that must be cast, Mirana is particularly vulnerable to silences that prevent her from casting Leap and Moonlight Shadow. As such, building an item that allows her to dispel debuffs from herself is crucial no matter what role she is played in.<br/><br/>Mirana's item and skill build can change drastically depending on what role she plays and how much farm priority she is given. There is no one-size-fits-all build for Mirana, as she can change her skill and item build depending on the situation, and even alter it in the middle of matches.<br/>In general, as a carry, Mirana focuses on increasing her survivability and building items to boost the power of her physical attacks, and using her spells to gank or help in setting up kills to further boost her gold gain. Due to her mediocre attribute growth, she focuses on ambushing and ganking enemies through hit-and-run attacks rather than taking their carry head-on. Mirana can be played as a carry in the safe lane, or as a semi-carry in the off-lane due to her ability to use Leap to escape enemy gank attempts.<br/><br/>As an early-game roamer, Mirana focuses on using Sacred Arrow to set up First Blood for her team. Successful kills on important enemy heroes, particularly their mid-laner or solo off-laner, can greatly set them back and give Mirana's team a strong laning advantage, which can transition into a farm and experience advantage from the mid-game onward. If successful, Mirana herself can transition into building utility items for her team, and play a semi-carry role.<br/><br/>When played as a support, Mirana initially focuses on building items to increase the size of her mana pool, and using her spells to add nuke damage and disable to teamfights. She then transitions into building support items that provide utility for her team, as well as performing the other normal support duties. Support Mirana generally babysits her safe lane carry, occasionally roaming to the mid-lane for kill attempts with Sacred Arrow.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Starstorm</h4>Starstorm calls down meteors that strike all enemy units near Mirana, with a second star striking the closest unit for additional damage.<br/><br/>Starstorm is a general-purpose magic nuke that allows Mirana to deal damage to all nearby enemies, as well as additional bonus damage to the closest unit.<br/><br/>Because of its area nuke ability, Starstorm is a good spell to max out early in a core farming role. The wide area damage combined with the low cooldown allows Mirana to farm creep waves and neutral camps very quickly, bolstering her gold and experience gain.<br/><br/>Be mindful that Starstorm's mana cost increases with each level, which can hinder Mirana's ability to cast it repeatedly. It is recommended to secure a reliable source of mana replenishment if you intend on using it to farm over long periods of time.<br/><br/>In order to utilize the damage of the second star, try to stand as close as possible to the target you want to take the extra damage prior to casting the spell. The target for the second star is determined upon initial cast, so subsequent movement will not affect it.<br/><br/>Starstorm's large fall radius allows it to hit all enemy units in a surprisingly wide area. If casting the spell to hit as many enemies as possible, try to stand as close to the center of their formation as possible.<br/><h4>Sacred Arrow</h4>Sacred Arrow, Mirana's signature ability, throws an arrow in the targeted direction, dealing damage and stunning the first enemy it hits based on its travel duration. If it hits a non-friendly non-Ancient creep, it is instantly killed.<br/><br/>Sacred Arrow is considered one of the most difficult spells to land in the entire game, however landing a long-ranged arrow can deal tremendous damage and stun an enemy for up to five seconds, making them easy prey for Mirana and her team.<br/><br/>Depending on Mirana's role, Sacred Arrow has differing priorities for maxing out. As it is single-target and only increases in damage as it is leveled up, it can be useful with only a value point when playing in a core role, as it is capable of stunning enemies for up to 5 seconds at all levels. As a support or roamer, maxing it out early allows Mirana to deal lots of damage to enemies in ganks, along with the stun duration.<br/><br/>When using Sacred Arrow to make gank attempts during the laning stage, use terrain cover and directional angles to your advantage. As trees are shrouded in the fog of war, firing from the direction of a treeline gives enemy players less time to see the arrow coming and dodge it. As well, firing the arrow from behind the enemy can give it the element of surprise, as players tend to be focused on the creep wave and their lane opponent(s) and will not expect to be hit with an arrow from the opposite direction.<br/><br/>Be sure to predict the enemy's intentions when casting Sacred Arrow at them. If an enemy player is going to approach a creep to last-hit it, firing Sacred Arrow at that point ahead of time can cause it to land as they approach and stop to last-hit. If an enemy is attempting to juke Mirana or her allies through trees, casting Sacred Arrow at their predicted path can hit them as they attempt to run away. If an opponent is actively trying to avoid the spell, it is possible to outwit them by firing the arrow in an obvious direction rather than trying to predict an obvious juking path that they know that you expect them to use.<br/><br/>Sacred Arrow can be made much easier to land when combined with a leading disable by an ally. Abilities like Nightmare and Disruption can pin an enemy in place long enough for a long-ranged Sacred Arrow to find its mark and disable the target for a further five seconds.<br/><br/>Used as a counter-gank spell, Sacred Arrow has the ability to completely turn teamfights around. If an ally is being chased by multiple enemies, firing a Sacred Arrow down their retreat path can force them to break pursuit, or can stun an enemy and leave them vulnerable for counterattack. The fleeing teammate can help facilitate this by juking through trees and forcing pursuers to follow a predictable path, or turn around and make the enemy stop in a predetermined location to be hit by the arrow.<br/><br/>If Sacred Arrow hits a non-friendly creep that is not an Ancient, it will instantly kill it regardless of level or travel distance. This can be useful for farming during down-time, as the spell can instantly kill the largest creep in a neutral camp or can immediately destroy a siege creep in-lane.<br/><br/>Sacred Arrow provides a large amount of flying vision as it travels. This allows the spell to be used for scouting purposes, firing it along treelines to search out enemies. In particular, it can be useful for scouting out split-pushers who can hide inside trees like Nature's Prophet, Broodmother and Tinker.<br/><br/>Beware that Sacred Arrow is almost worthless at point-blank range, dealing almost no damage and very little stun duration. Unless you need the mini-stun to interrupt a channeling ability, it is better to simply use physical attacks at close range rather than trying to hit the target with an arrow.<br/><h4>Leap</h4>Leap is an instant-cast re-positioning spell that causes Mirana to jump forward in her facing direction, buffing all nearby allies in the originating area with increased movement and attack speed.<br/><br/>Because of its ability to re-position Mirana instantly, Leap is a very strong spell to use for initiations and escape. At least one early value point should be taken no matter what role Mirana is played in.<br/><br/>Combined with Sacred Arrow and Starstorm, Mirana is capable of inflicting large amounts of damage during ganks. Upon successfully hitting a target with a long-range Sacred Arrow, she can quickly Leap in for the kill, putting her within range for a double Starstorm and buffing her attack speed as she uses her physical attacks to finish the hapless target off.<br/><br/>Leap goes down in mana cost and cooldown alongside increasing its speed bonuses and displacement distance as it is leveled up. If mobility is important, maxing Leap out early can give Mirana increased survivability and boost her offensive potential through the attack speed bonus.<br/><br/>Because of its instant cast time, Leap can be used to easily disjoint incoming enemy projectiles as needed, instead of simply re-positioning her and boosting her mobility. As well, it is capable of displacing Mirana over terrain, allowing her to jump over cliffs and through trees in order to evade pursuers.<br/><br/>When using Leap as an escape ability, it can help to cast it as early as possible. As Mirana herself is also empowered by the movement and attack speed bonus, jumping to safety early on can boost her movement speed immediately and allow her to quickly speed away from enemy pursuers. The movement speed bonus also empowers nearby allies, allowing them to clear the area more quickly as well.<br/><br/>Never discount the speed bonuses that Leap gives nearby allies upon cast. Buffing teammates' attack and movement speed can give them an edge in battle, allowing them to more quickly position themselves to cast spells, chase down fleeing enemies, and use their physical attacks to great effect. When initiating a teamfight, it may be useful to cast Leap to empower your team at the start of the engagement.<br/><br/>Beware that unlike most other forms of self-displacement, Leap is unable to free Mirana from Pounce. If there is a Slark on the enemy team, be extremely mindful of his positioning and be prepared to build a Black King Bar, as Mirana is otherwise extremely vulnerable to being preyed on by him.<br/><h4>Moonlight Shadow</h4>Moonlight Shadow globally places a buff on all allied heroes, causing them to fade into invisibility for as long as they do not attack, cast spells or use items for the duration of the buff.<br/><br/>Moonlight Shadow is an extremely strong ganking spell, as it can act as a pseudo Smoke of Deceit to give Mirana's team a strong initiating advantage.<br/><br/>Used as an escape ability, Moonlight Shadow is able to provide invisibility not only to Mirana, but also to teammates no matter where they are. The spell can be used to globally save teammates from enemy ganks so long as they don't have detection.<br/><br/>Beware that when casting Moonlight Shadow to gank, all allies who are within enemy vision will be marked by the moon symbol, allowing enemies to see that the spell is active during the initial fade time. This can give away that a gank is afoot, allowing the enemy to retreat or even set up a counter-gank.<br/><br/>Be sure not to be too complacent when casting Moonlight Shadow, as it is still possible for enemies to use detection and spot out Mirana and her allies. This can be particularly dangerous if Mirana and her team are grouped too closely together while ganking, as enemies can cast area disables to great effect.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Slippers of Agility provide Mirana with additional base damage and armor, greatly improving her last-hitting power and giving her some additional survivability against enemy harass.<br/><br/>Tangoes and Healing Salve allow Mirana to sustain her HP while in-lane, preventing the enemy from harassing her out of lane.<br/><br/>Clarity is crucial for allowing Mirana to cast her spells more than once or twice in the laning stage, particularly because of her small base mana pool and the high cost of her nukes, particularly Sacred Arrow.<br/><br/>Animal Courier and Flying Courier can be easily purchased by Mirana, as her early-game effectiveness is not tied down by item dependence.<br/><br/>Observer Ward and Sentry Ward are very important to purchase as a support Mirana. Getting vision on enemies allows her to use Sacred Arrow more effectively, while destroying enemy vision can prevent them from spotting Mirana's approach and dodge her arrows.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is very useful to purchase early on Mirana, as her small HP and mana pools mean that she benefits greatly from the burst regen.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed allow Mirana to go on the offensive, using her respectable base movement speed and ranged attacks to attack and harass enemies. It also allows for more easy positioning for casting Sacred Arrow, and chasing down or fleeing with Leap.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila provides all-around attributes, as well as increased agility for better right-click damage. The flat mana regen disproportionately benefits Mirana in the early game due to her poor intelligence growth, while the armor gives her increased survivability. The aura allows Mirana to more easily push lanes and threaten enemy towers, especially when combined with Starstorm.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is an important item to carry on all heroes at all times. In Mirana's case, her ability to turn teamfights around with Sacred Arrow or push lanes with Starstorm means that globally re-positioning herself is greatly beneficial to her team.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a cheap upgrade to Magic Stick, providing extra attributes and increased charge storage. Because Mirana's HP and mana pools remain quite low without additional items, an instant 255 HP and mana is greatly beneficial to her.<br/><br/>Power Treads will provide Mirana with additional bonuses to attack speed and attributes. With good attribute switching, Mirana can increase her strength for increased survivability, agility for more damage output, or more intelligence for casting her spells.<br/><br/>Phase Boots is situationally powerful for Mirana over Power Treads. The greatly improved bonus damage gives her increased last-hitting power, and the active synergizes with Leap in improving her ability; as well, the attack speed bonus of Leap allows her to better leverage the damage bonus.<br/><br/>Manta Style gives Mirana a large amount of bonus agility and attack speed, as well as increased strength and intelligence for overall increased resilience. The movement speed bonus makes Mirana more agile, allowing her to chase and escape more easily, as well as position herself for casting spells. The active can be used to remove debuffs from Mirana, allowing her to use escape abilities, create illusions to deal more damage when on the offensive, or can be used to scout out terrain to reveal enemy positioning.<br/><br/>Bottle is very powerful as a roaming Mirana. The ability to replenish her small HP and mana pools allows her to roam independently and be active on the map, spending less time returning to base to heal and more time stalking enemies for kill opportunities.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Drum of Endurance provides Mirana with stats across the board and is easy to build. The strength and intelligence shore up her small HP and mana pools, while the movement and attack speed aura improve her mobility and offensive potential. The active stacks alongside Leap, allowing Mirana to greatly empower all nearby allies' attack and movement speed during teamfights.<br/><br/>Butterfly is a very strong carry item in Mirana's hands. It provides a large boost to her agility, and increases her damage and attack speed to greatly improve the potency of her physical attacks. The bonus evasion increases her survivability, and the active can be used to improve her mobility in emergencies.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade improves Mirana's physical attacks, providing a boost to agility as well as allowing her attacks to burn mana. The active can purge enemies, greatly slowing them and making them easy targets for Sacred Arrow, and can be cast on herself and her allies to remove debuffs, particularly if they have been hit by Dust of Appearance during Moonlight Shadow.<br/><br/>Desolator is a strong mid-game item that gives Mirana more damage output. Because she can stun enemies for long durations with Sacred Arrow and boost allied attack speed with Leap, the armor reduction on enemy targets makes them easy prey for Mirana and her allies.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar is a situational purchase that aids Mirana in fighting enemies that have evasion. It improves Mirana's damage output through increased bonus damage and attack speed, and her innately high attack speed allows her to proc the mini-bash more frequently.<br/><br/>Daedalus greatly improves Mirana's damage output, turning her into a fearsome carry in her own right. By greatly improving her attack damage and giving her the chance to inflict critical strikes, Mirana can take advantage of her high attack speed and lay waste to foes.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere gives Mirana all-around stats as well as boosting her HP and mana regen. Spellblock further improves Mirana's survivability, allowing her to ignore an enemy's initiating targeted disable, which can give her the time she needs to escape with Leap if ganked.<br/><br/>Black King Bar can be crucial to purchase depending on what enemies Mirana is facing. Not only does the item provide spell immunity, but it is also capable of purging certain debuffs that Manta Style cannot, allowing Mirana to stand her ground and fight.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass greatly improves Mirana's fighting power and gives her yet another way to buff her team's effectiveness. The greatly increased armor makes Mirana much more survivable against physical damage, while the bonus attack speed allows her to utilize her physical attacks to great effect. The aura can be used alongside Leap to greatly increase teammates' combat effectiveness by providing them with movement speed, armor and attack speed, along with reducing nearby enemies' armor to further increase the potency of allies' physical attacks.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is a very strong item to purchase on Mirana. It improves her stats across the board, mitigating her small HP and mana pools while also providing bonus agility for increased physical damage output. The Unique Attack Modifier allows Mirana to slow her targets, which can be used alongside Leap to create a large movement and attack speed disparity between Mirana's team and her foes.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is a strong attack modifier item to purchase on Mirana. It greatly empowers her attack speed and gives her the ability to deal area magical damage, synergizing with Leap and Starstorm. The active can be placed on your team's lead initiator, allowing them to deal additional area magical damage during teamfights.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can be an excellent source of early mana and health regeneration. The ability to instantly gain enough mana to use an extra spell can be extremely helpful in both offensive and defensive situations. Soul Ring can also allow more uses of Sacred Arrow to ensure more reliable farm in lane, guarantee ranged creep kills, or passively farm a stacked camp nearby without leaving lane.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a strong utility item to purchase early on as Mirana. The extra strength gives her more HP for increased survivability, and the mana regen helps to sustain her casting requirements as needed. Charges can be easily obtained through participating in ganks, and the charges used to heal teammates or to add further damage in future ganks.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage and its upgrade Solar Crest are strong items that synergize with Mirana's ganking capabilities. Medallion of Courage provides armor and mana regen, and when upgraded to Solar Crest provides evasion as well for greatly improved survivability. Using the active on a Sacred Arrow victim makes them increasingly vulnerable to physical damage, which can be compounded with Leap to buff allies' attack speed.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots is important to purchase as early as possible as a support Mirana. The ability to replenish her mana pool allows her to cast Sacred Arrow and her other spells more frequently, and helps to keep allies' mana topped up as well.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is useful to obtain if the enemy chooses to focus Mirana in fights. Because a support Mirana is not able to easily farm items to improve her own survivability, Ghost Scepter allows her to become temporarily invulnerable against physical damage.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a strong utility item to purchase as a support Mirana. It provides bonus intelligence to shore up her small base mana pool, and HP regen to help keep her health pool topped up. The active can be used alongside Leap to greatly augment Mirana's mobility, and can be cast on allies to help them to escape if they are caught out of position by enemies.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a very strong caster item that greatly improves Mirana's potency as a support. It provides bonus intelligence and mana regen, greatly improving her ability to cast her spells, and additional movement speed to give her more mobility, especially when combined with Leap. The active can be cast on herself to provide temporary invulnerability while removing debuffs from herself, or can be used on an enemy to make them a sitting duck for Sacred Arrow.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos greatly improves Mirana's overall resilience and is easy to build. It provides a large amount of HP and intelligence, improving Mirana's survivability and giving her a larger mana pool with which to cast spells. The active, with its long range and low cooldown, can greatly slow an enemy to hit them with Sacred Arrow, and can be combined with Leap to allow allies to easily chase down fleeing enemies.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Monkey King is a trickster hero who jumps from treetop to treetop, scouting out his opponents from above, waiting for the opportunity to crash down on them with Primal Spring. With his magic extending staff, he smashes distant foes with Boundless Strikes, each blow charging his weapon through Jingu Mastery. Prone to Mischief, the Monkey King disguises himself as trees and everyday objects, allowing him to ambush enemies, or deceive them for a quick getaway.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tricky and elusive.<br/><br/>Very mobile.<br/><br/>Reliable damage.<br/><br/>Long melee attack range.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Highly dependent on trees.<br/><br/>Suffers long stun if he falls from a tree.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to stuns.<br/><br/>Requires consecutive hits to benefit from passive bonus.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Unlike most melee heroes, Monkey King has an attack range of 300, allowing him to attack other melee opponents without fear of retaliation.<br/><br/>Take advantage of Monkey King's ability to hop from tree to tree to retreat into the treeline around the edges of the map whenever he is threatened.<br/><br/>Due to Monkey King's ultimate being unaffected by attack speed and Boundless Strike relying solely on raw damage values, players would have go for raw damage and agility in order to maximise these skills. Take note not to forgo attack speed completely, as attack speed helps with Jingu Mastery and his basic attacks.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Boundless Strike</h4>Boundless Strike's damage depends entirely on Monkey King's basic damage, so building up high damage and agility items will tremendously increase its damage output.<br/>Boundless Strike's critical multiplier is not significant until later in the game, when Monkey King has more damage.<br/><br/>Boundless Strike's damage output is augmented by the damage bonus from Jingu Mastery. Use Boundless Strike when Jingu Mastery stacks are available to deal high damage in the early game.<br/><br/><br/>Boundless Strike is affected by Jingu Mastery and will apply a counter stack and expend a charge as if it were performed by a basic attack.<br/>Each hero caught by its reach will have a counter stack applied onto them.<br/><br/>Boundless Strike will always expend a single charge, regardless of how many enemies are hit or if it misses entirely. Try to maximise the potential of each charge by hitting clumps of opponents at once.<br/><br/>Boundless Strike will only trigger off of one hero's counter if the resulting strike hits multiple heroes with a counter stack of 3.<br/><br/><br/>Because of its long cooldown, Boundless Strike should be used carefully.<br/><br/>Levels in Boundless Strike increases the stun duration by 0.4 seconds and critical multiplier by 20% per point. It may be wise to invest just a single point in Boundless Strike during the early stages of the game for the purpose of interrupting abilities, if your team has other heroes with disables.<br/><br/>Use Boundless Strike to hit enemies through trees, high ground, and other obstacles.<br/><br/>Use Boundless Strike after jumping on an enemy with Primal Spring to deal burst damage.<br/>In some circumstances, Boundless Strike should be saved to disable or interrupt targets after they have used a disable or escape ability.<br/>For example, Boundless Strike should be saved to interrupt Pugna after he starts channeling Life Drain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boundless Strike has a fairly quick animation and impact time. Monkey King can turn around and land a Boundless Strike to momentarily stun his opponents, even when retreating with low health.<br/><h4>Tree Dance</h4>Tree Dance has no mana cost as well as a very low cooldown. Use this ability to bypass cliffs and transverse across the map quickly.<br/>While perched upon a tree, the Move command is linked to the Tree Dance ability, and functions exactly as Tree Dance does.<br/><br/>Tree Dance is placed on cooldown whenever Monkey King takes player-based damage, similar to the mechanics of Blink Dagger, making it near impossible to use as an escape mechanism once Monkey King is engaged in combat.<br/>Use Primal Spring to dislodge yourself from a tree if you are being attacked by an opponent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Monkey King is disarmed while perched, but he is able to use items and his skills without restriction.<br/>Boundless Strike and Mischief can be used while on a tree without causing Monkey King to jump off.<br/><br/>Items like Force Staff or Hurricane Pike, Blink Dagger and Eul's Scepter of Divinity will force Monkey King to descend from his tree.<br/><br/>Take the opportunity to place Observer Wards in unorthodox and hard-to-reach places that can't normally be accessible by other heroes.<br/><br/><br/>While perched in a tree, activating Tree Dance again will highlight nearby trees that are within range of being perched from your current tree with a soft aura.<br/><br/>Monkey King is masked in the Fog of War while he is perched in a tree. Enemies require flying or unobstructed vision in order to target Monkey King while he is perched.<br/>However, when Monkey King jumps from one tree to another, he can be seen and targeted as if he were on the ground.<br/><br/><br/>Be wary of opponents with items and abilities that can destroy trees, such as Lina and Timbersaw. If Monkey King is perched on top of a tree while it is destroyed, he will be stunned for 4 seconds, which would almost guarantee your demise.<br/><h4>Primal Spring</h4>This ability cannot be canceled by Monkey King. If the channeling is stopped by Monkey King, he will still cast the ability for a reduced amount of damage and slow.<br/><br/>Be wary that Primal Spring produces a sound effect while charging up, which can be heard by allies and opponents alike. A cunning opponent may be able to guess your location and may avoid the general area or even try to cut down your tree and turn the tables on you.<br/><br/>Use Primal Spring as an emergency escape ability if Monkey King is being attacked, as Tree Dance will be placed on cooldown if he takes any damage from other heroes.<br/><br/>Primal Spring can be used immediately after a Tree Dance jump. Using these 2 skills consecutively makes for a very good gap closer with a max total of 2000 range.<br/><br/>Unlike most abilities, Primal Spring does not have a visual indicator to denote the maximum cast range and instead locks and prevents the targeting reticle of the ability from exiting its maximum cast range.<br/><h4>Jingu Mastery</h4>Monkey King can apply a counter stack to each opponent through the use of Boundless Strike.<br/>Each hero struck by Boundless Strike will have a counter stack applied onto them.<br/><br/>Boundless Strike will always expend a single charge, regardless of how many enemies are hit or if it misses entirely. Try to maximise the potential of each charge by hitting clumps of opponents at once.<br/><br/>Boundless Strike will only trigger off of one hero's counter if the resulting strike hits multiple heroes with a counter stack of 3.<br/><br/><br/>Charges of Jingu Mastery are dispellable. Keep a look out for enemies with the ability to do so.<br/>If you believe that your opponents are going to purge or dispel you, use up your charges on nearby enemy or neutral creeps. Even if you are not dealing direct damage to your opponents, you will be able to recover a considerable amount of health from using your charges<br/><br/><br/>Jingu Mastery charges are lost if Monkey King dies. This applies even if he is holding onto the Aegis of the Immortal and reincarnates.<br/>Depending on the circumstances, you can take the risk and fight and expend your charges in the hopes of recovering enough health. You may even be able to turn the tables on your pursuer.<br/><br/><br/>Jingu Mastery charges are only granted after four successful hits on the same opponent. Try to stick to the same target in order to ensure you gain your charges as quickly as possible.<br/>However, do not be too aggressive and reckless in pursuing an enemy for the purpose of activating Jingu Mastery, as you may end up exposing yourself to greater threat.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can consider spreading out your attacks on multiple opponents, and quickly regain new charges once you fully expend your current load.<br/><br/><br/>Jingu Mastery does not acquire new charges nor does it apply a counter on opponents when there are charges remaining on Monkey King.<br/><br/>Illusions do not benefit from Jingu Mastery, and as such, they do not apply or add on to a counter.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango helps Monkey King stay in lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Monkey King in a pinch.<br/><br/>Stout Shield helps against lane harassment and can be upgraded to Poor Man's Shield if needed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Ring of Aquila provides a decent early game stats boost.<br/><br/>Blight Stone helps Monkey King hit harder, and can be built later into a Desolator.<br/><br/>Bottle helps Monkey King get runes, which he can reach easily by jumping through trees.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots allows Monkey King to catch up to opponents.<br/><br/>Echo Sabre makes it much easier for Monkey King to get Jingu Mastery stacks. The slow is very helpful as well and can be applied by the soldiers from Wukong's Command.<br/><br/>Skull Basher helps Monkey King lock down his opponents. His soldiers from Wukong's Command can also proc the bash modifier.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade is useful for ganking with four Jingu Mastery charges, and can be used to escape or to stay inside of Wukong's Command.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Mjollnir grants extra attack speed, and its Chain Lightning can be procced by Boundless Strike and by the soldiers from Wukong's Command.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade's active slow helps Monkey King gank. His soldiers from Wukong's Command can also proc attack modifiers.<br/><br/>Desolator increases the damage done by Monkey King significantly as he is based mainly around physical damage.<br/><br/>Black King Bar helps Monkey King build up his Jingu Mastery charges without being interrupted.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives Monkey King more survivability and strong slowing effect to help land the multiple hits needed to charge Jingu Mastery.<br/><br/>Vanguard builds into Abyssal Blade as well as gives Monkey King more survivability earlier on.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade allows Monkey King to hold enemies down long enough to get Jingu Mastery stacks.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is the logical upgrade of Shadow Blade, and can be used to stay inside of Wukong's Command without risking death.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha's Maim can be procced by the soldiers from Wukong's Command, keeping enemies inside the area if they're trying to escape.<br/><br/>Moon Shard gives massive attack speed bonus to help Monkey King stack Jingu Mastery charges faster. Moon shard can be consumed later to be replaced by other items which grant attack speed and more utility, such as an Assault Cuirass or Mjollnir.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Morphling is a carry hero who switches between damage dealer and resilient survivor. With an Ethereal Blade, Morphling can deal extremely high burst damage, often taking out an enemy instantly. However, he suffers from item and level dependency, as well as a low mana pool and low movement speed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can easily switch between dealing a ton of damage or having a high HP pool.<br/><br/>Can one shot most heroes in the game with Ethereal Blade.<br/><br/>Has an escape ability with a huge range..<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Short attack range.<br/><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>One of the slowest heroes in the game.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Early on, go mid or have a support keep you safe in the safe lane while you farm.<br/><br/>Focus on farming up items. Only go for kills if you know you can get it.<br/><br/>Morphling functions better as a carry in teams with a strong front line. This allows him to remain in the fight with a high amount of agility and hence right click or Adaptive Strike damage, without feeling the pressure of being focused. Although he is good at soaking damage through Morph Strength and items such as Linken's Sphere and Eye of Skadi, he is much more useful as your team's primary source of consistent damage.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Waveform</h4>Use this to escape from ganks early game. If going for kills, use this after using Adaptive Strike if you have that leveled.<br/><br/>Assuming you have the regen and the mana pool, you can use waveform to speed up farming while going for those big items.<br/><br/>Morphling's early game damage is relatively high with Waveform and decent right click through Morph. Consider laning with an aggressive support to grab some early game kills so you can accelerate your farm and reach your late game faster.<br/><h4>Adaptive Strike</h4>As Adaptive Strike scales with attributes, it should not be leveled until after Waveform is maxed and should be the last ability maxed out.<br/><br/>When wanting to maximize the damage, shift to full damage. If needing to escape, use it after you shift to mostly strength.<br/><br/>This is your primary damage spell after you finish Ethereal Blade<br/><br/>You do not need to go full agility or strength. Only 50% agility over strength is needed, and vice versa<br/><h4>Morph</h4>As Morph gives +3 to both Agility and Strength with one level, it is a very strong ability to get at level 1.<br/><br/>Know when to switch between agility and strength. During the laning stage, put more into agility but keep enough in strength so if you get ganked you'll have enough HP to survive. When farming creeps, feel free to put more into agility, and when escaping fights put more into strength.<br/><br/>If you are low on life and being chased/targeted, use Morph to increase your health and health regeneration to increase the difficulty of killing you. Note the moderate mana cost with this ability on.<br/><br/>Agility will increase damage, attack speed, and armor which increases EHP vs physical opponents. Strength, but more HP increases your EHP vs spells.<br/><br/>When lower strength, you also lose 20 for your current HP Pool each time the strength lowers. This cannot deny yourself.<br/><br/>Since Morph has a toggle ability, it will continue to function even while silenced; provided the ability was toggled on prior to being silenced.<br/><br/>When going back to base consider morphing some agility into strength in case of enemies with global abilities such as Zeus and Ancient Apparition or even Clockwerk and Nature's Prophet.<br/><h4>Replicate</h4>Use this on carries who build a lot of stat items to increase the effectiveness of them.<br/><br/>Alternatively use this on squishy supports and try to bait heroes into attacking it so you can Morph Replicate in and get an easy kill. Make sure the area around it is safe first.<br/><br/>If using it on carries, enable control for them so they can control the illusion themselves to help with whatever they're doing.<br/><br/>Sometimes deciding which hero to choose for Replicate can be difficult, however potential candidates for this spell include: a hero with high DPS, those with favorable passives (such as Axe's Counter Helix), squishy support heroes that can be used for bait, tanky heroes (Replicates only take 100% damage), or even an enemy hero that has a Radiance or some other aura, which allows you to take advantage of receiving its effects for free.<br/><br/>Unlike most illusions in the game, the illusion created by Replicate does not take bonus damage, making it difficult to distinguish from an actual hero. You can use this to your advantage by replicating a high-priority ally and using the illusion to bait out enemy spells.<br/><br/>Remember there are a handful of abilities that are able to kill illusions instantly, easily wasting Replicate and Hybrid. Such abilities include Life Drain, Mana Drain and Hex.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango should always be picked up to give you sustain. If heading mid consider asking the supports to pool you tangoes.<br/><br/>Iron Branch give cost efficient stats and can be placed to increase the healing from your Tangoes.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection improves Morphling's rather low starting armor.<br/><br/>Wraith Band should be considered if going mid rather than safe lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Bottle should be the first item purchased if Morphling is playing the mid lane.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are necessary on Morphling to improve his slow 285 base movement speed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Ring of Aquila provides Damage, Mana regeneration and Armor, all of which Morphling needs.<br/><br/>Power Treads are a great addition to Morphling's Build as they allow for a quick switch from attack power (Agility) to extra health (Strength).<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi allows Morphling to be fully agility morphed and still have a significant amount of HP. This means Skadi is an offensive and defensive item.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Ethereal Blade is a very interesting pickup on Morphling, and he is the strongest user of the item in the game. Often referred to as "Shotgun Morphling", Ethereal Blade allows you to very quickly deal a very large amount of magic damage to a single target by using the E-Blade active, Adaptive Strike, and Waveform in quick succession while morphed to high agility. This gives Morphling roaming and pick off potential. This is best gotten as the first or second major item on Morphling, as its effectiveness falls off once enemy heroes tank up, get BKBs, or start to group up. If you feel this item has outlived its usefulness, consider disassembling it to make a Butterfly. Keep in mind it scales really well with Morphling and can still output loads of damage late game.<br/><br/>Butterfly gives a very large amount of damage and is one of the strongest defensive items in the game against enemy auto-attacks.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is very strong on Morphling, not only for the single target spell block, but also for the regeneration and stats that this item provides. Drawbacks of this item include the fact that it only blocks one spell, and its high cost. If a Linkens Sphere is not a viable item, a Black King Bar should be considered instead.<br/><br/>Satanic allows Morphling to use his high DPS to rapidly heal himself full, via the active. However, if you get stunned while trying to lifesteal, you can still be very easily killed, so it should be paired with Black King Bar or used against teams with little lockdown potential.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is just a safe item to get if Linken's Sphere doesn't quite give you the protection from spells you need. That being said, don't replace Linkens with Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade provides boost to agility (for Adaptive Strike) and improves physical dps as well as allowing his attacks to burn mana. It is like cheaper version of Butterfly giving purge ability in a cost of evasion.<br/><br/>Manta Style is very strong on Morphling, as his items are primarily attribute-based, which illusions inherit. An agility morphed Morphling with a few items can produce illusions that out-damage most other heroes in the game. Because silences are also potent counters against Morphling, a Manta Style's ability to purge debuffs and silences synergies well with his escape mechanisms.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Naga Siren is a versatile hero who can appear to be a team's hard carry while actually being just a support. As a support, you can pin down an enemy with your bkb-piercing Ensnare, reduce his armor with Rip Tide and hit him without putting yourself in danger with Mirror Image. And you have a fearsome teamfight ultimate with your dreamy Song of the Siren which will put your enemies to sleep. As a carry however, you will use your images and Rip Tide to farm the jungle and push the lanes, and your Song as a get-out-of-jail-free card, eventually crushing the enemy's base under the ocean's pressure.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Role versatility.<br/><br/>Good at split-pushing and wave cutting.<br/><br/>Ultimate allows team to reset fights.<br/><br/>Good carrier for Gem of True Sight.<br/><br/>Low cooldown root that pierces spell immunity.<br/><br/>Probably the fastest farmer in the game once you've acquired a Radiance.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Somewhat farm dependent even if played as a support.<br/><br/>Extremely farm dependent if played as a carry.<br/><br/>Easy to misuse ultimate with poor communication.<br/><br/>Requires some basic micro-management skills.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>A very strong combination on Naga Siren is Linken's Sphere and Boots of Travel. This makes Naga an incredibly versatile pusher, and Linkens makes it nigh impossible to catch her off-guard while pushing, allowing for an easy Song of Siren escape. Another item worth mentioning is Radiance. Slithice's illusions carry the Radiance aura, allowing farming over large areas and greater combat presence.<br/><br/>Naga Siren can push with impunity; Rip Tide can affect entire creep waves, Mirror Image's illusions can deal tremendous damage to towers, and Song of the Siren makes it very difficult for the enemy team to gank her even if overextended.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Mirror Image</h4>Mirror Image's period of invulnerability is very short, but can allow Naga Siren to dodge many spells. Some easier examples (due to slow projectile speed) include Sven's Storm Hammer and Necrophos's Death Pulse.<br/><br/>Note that none of the auras from Vladmir's Offering will affect illusions from Mirror Image, but they will carry it for the rest of your team, or to help creeps.<br/><br/>Combined with Rip Tide and items, the illusions generated by Mirror Image can greatly enhance Naga Sirens's farm, allowing her to take two camps at once during the early game, and eventually three to four from mid to late game.<br/><br/>Mirror image has a lengthy 40-second cooldown (down to 30 with Octarine Core). When trying to defend against numerous opponents, do not waste your illusions by sending them all at once. Instead, send them one by one, and perhaps try to have one get around the enemy heroes to block and destroy the next incoming creep wave.<br/><h4>Ensnare</h4>It is important to keep Ensnare's unique properties in mind. Its major downside is that Ensnare only prevents movement, and does not stop enemies from fighting back with attacks and spells.<br/>Ensnare can be applied to targets with Spell Immunity, most notably holders of Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Ensnare will interrupt channeling abilities such as Witch Doctor's Death Ward.<br/><br/>Heroes with invisibility such as Bounty Hunter, Riki and Weaver should be prime targets of Ensnare, as they will be revealed for its duration.<br/><br/>Ensnare will also prevent the usage of teleportation such as Anti-Mage's Blink.<br/><br/>Ensnare can also be used to snare the Animal Courier, preventing it from moving allowing for an easy kill.<br/><br/><h4>Rip Tide</h4>Rip Tide's damage and armor reduction mean that Naga Siren can hit hard even in the early game, and is more than viable to level first. Even when fully leveled, the magic damage it deals is mediocre. Its most important attribute is ultimately armor reduction, which can multiply the physical damage that is dealt by you, your team, and your illusions<br/><br/>Rip Tide will affect targets around Naga's Mirror Images and other illusions. Illusions can be used to engage for Naga, due to their expendable nature.<br/><br/>Once you're farming creep waves with the Radiance burn, you can secure a couple of extra last hits using the nuke damage from Rip Tide rather than relying on the burn.<br/>However, this will ultimately make you push slower since your allied creeps won't benefit from the armor reduction on the enemies.<br/><br/><h4>Song of the Siren</h4>Song of the Siren is often used to make another initiator's job much easier, as it gives them time to position themselves while your targets are stunned.<br/><br/>It is possible for you to rudely interrupt your teammates' momentum when using this ability for your own sake. Avoid using it as an extra team-fight disable when your teammates already have the upper hand disabling the enemy, as it wastes their abilities by completely making their targets invulnerable. Opt for using Ensnare as a disable instead.<br/><br/>When a crucial escape is necessary (i.e. when losing a team fight), use this ability to impede your pursuers. Any opposing target who approaches you will be stopped in their tracks, making for a smoother exit.<br/><br/>In a bad situation, You can use a Town Portal Scroll during Song of the Siren, or you walk away for a smooth escape.<br/><br/>The interaction between Song of the Siren and an opposing Black King Bar is important. BKB can help enemies avoid being locked down by Song, but it may also make that enemy vulnerable in a teamfight by allowing Naga's team to focus on one target without backup, especially when combined with Ensnare. Enemies should try to activate their BKBs together or take special care in their positioning to reduce this danger.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve both provide needed health regeneration during the laning phase.<br/><br/>Stout Shield help reduce the amount of damage she might take from harassment and creeps while laning. It further upgrades into a Poor Man's Shield for improved protection.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Ring of Aquila provides some attributes as well as a source of mana regeneration for her and her lane partner.<br/><br/>Bottle is useful for regeneration and rune control if farming the mid lane.<br/><br/>Infused Raindrop gives good mana regeneration to keep spamming your spells, and allows Naga Siren to survive some magical burst.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Boots of Travel makes Naga Siren an incredibly strong pusher and increases her farm speed.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives solid overall attributes, some movement speed and attack speed in an aura and a strong active that gives even more attack and movement speed to Naga Siren and all allied heroes/illusions around her.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Radiance gives a lot of damage and the Radiance aura works on illusions, giving Naga Siren the ability to farm multiple areas of the map at the same time thanks to Mirror Image.<br/><br/>Manta Style gives her good attribute bonuses as well as the ability to summon more illusions.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade gives her more damage, armor and attack speed, as well as the Manabreak Attack Modifier which greatly boosts the damage output of her and her illusions.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque provides a large amount of health, tanking Naga Siren and her illusions up massively. It also provides an enormous passive health regeneration while not fighting, so she can return to fights faster with full health.<br/><br/>Butterfly offers bonus attack speed, damage and armor, and the evasion gives more survivability to her and her illusions.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere provides good all around attributes as well as regeneration, which allows Naga Siren to stay farming without having to go back to base. On top of that, it provides a spellblock which can make Naga Siren harder to kill in conjunction with Song of the Siren.<br/><br/>Daedalus will provide Naga Siren, her Mirror Image illusions and any other illusions with a critical strike, as well as providing raw bonus damage for the main Naga Siren.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is recommended mostly as an option when Naga Siren is played as a Support or when she has a great lead, but can greatly increase the survivability of her and her allies.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots solve Naga Siren's mana issues, and the Energy Booster can later be recycled into an Octarine Core.<br/><br/>Octarine Core reduces the cooldowns of Naga Siren's abilities, greatly improving her pushing power and making her much harder to gank. The Spell Lifesteal has little effect on her own abilities, but can be combined with Radiance to let her illusions shrug off damage from creeps.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Nyx Assassin is a powerful roamer whose burst damage nukes allows him to quickly kill any lone heroes he encounters. While his spells provide relatively little teamfight contribution outside of Impale, his ability to kill the enemy one by one can put the enemy team at a disadvantage in terms of economy, creating opportunities for his team to take advantageous teamfights or outfarm the opposition. However, Nyx Assassin's abilities fall off in the late game, where he plays a more supporting role with his stuns.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage.<br/><br/>Reflects damage.<br/><br/>Can give a big space advantage to his team by ganking the enemy team in the early to mid game.<br/><br/>High health regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Less effective in the late game.<br/><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>More information needed.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Despite his mediocre attribute growth, Nyx Assassin is a deceptively durable hero, as he can take advantage of damage block items in-lane due to being a melee hero and possesses higher-than-average base HP regen. As well, his Spiked Carapace ability allows him to shrug off extremely powerful damage nukes that could kill other heroes.<br/><br/>Because of his skill set, Nyx Assassin prioritizes in building items that increase the size of his mana pool and provide mana replenishment. His ability to roam autonomously and kill with his high burst alpha means that he can do more for his team if he does not have to return to base frequently to refill his HP and mana. As well, items that improve his mobility, nuking and disabling power will better allow him to find, chase down and kill important targets.<br/><br/>Beware that while Nyx Assassin's spells have respectable cast ranges, his 0.4 second cast animation means that they can be telegraphed and anticipated by the enemy, allowing them to counter the spells. Surprise is key to getting off Nyx Assassin's spells, as the enemy may be able to otherwise avoid them.<br/><br/>Nyx Assassin is best played as a roamer or a solo off-laner in order to maximize his effectiveness.<br/>As an off-laner, Nyx Assassin can take advantage of his innately high base HP regen to survive enemy harassment, and has Spiked Carapace at his disposal to deflect enemy magic nukes back at their caster. By taking advantage of solo experience and possibly gold if he can manipulate creep equilibrium to favor him, Nyx Assassin can get an early level 6 to begin roaming and getting kills with Vendetta.<br/><br/>As a roamer, Nyx Assassin focuses on taking advantage of his respectable base movement speed and the long cast range of Impale to set up kills for his team in their lanes. Getting important pick-offs during the laning stage can get him the gold and levels he needs to further roam in the mid-game, and can set back the enemy's level and item progression considerably, making them easier targets to kill.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Impale</h4>Impale is a ground-targeted disable that stuns and damages enemies in a line in front of Nyx Assassin.<br/><br/>As Nyx Assassin's primary disable, Impale should be maxed out first, as both its damage and stun duration scale as it is leveled up. Its long cast range allows Nyx Assassin to stun enemies from a surprising range.<br/><br/>The area nature of Impale means that it is possible to damage and stun multiple enemy heroes with a single cast. This can be very useful both for initiating engagements by stunning multiple enemy heroes at the start, or for saving fleeing teammates by stopping pursuers in their tracks.<br/><br/>Great skill is required in order to successfully land Impale, as Nyx Assassin's long cast animation, the unreliable ground-targeted nature of the spell, and the travel time of the spell itself can give enemies almost a full second to react if they are far enough away. If a leading stun is not available, good aiming and prediction skills are needed in order to ensure that Impale will successfully stun its intended target.<br/><br/>Impale will still animate if it catches an invisible hero; if a spike elevates with no visible enemy units, it means that the spell has hit an invisible enemy. This can be useful for finding fleeing enemy heroes who may have cast invisibility to escape, as detection or follow-up area stuns and nukes can then be employed to finish them off.<br/><br/>Remember that as Impale is not a reliable targeted stun, it cannot be blocked by Linken's Sphere. Use this to your advantage when initiating on enemies that are relying on its protection, casting a more expendable spell or item ability to break it while the target is stunned.<br/><h4>Mana Burn</h4>Mana Burn is a unit-targeted spell that destroys a portion of an enemy hero's mana based on their intelligence, and then deals the same amount as magical damage.<br/><br/>Because the ability scales with the intelligence of the target, Mana Burn is extremely powerful against heroes with high intelligence growth but low strength such as Skywrath Mage, Pugna and so on. Targeting low-health intelligence supports can allow Nyx Assassin to quickly remove them from the field before they are able to participate in an engagement.<br/><br/>The damage scaling and cooldown reduction on Mana Burn makes it a good spell to max out early in a match. However, its flat mana cost also prevents Nyx Assassin from utilizing the spell more than a few times in the early game, until he increases the size of his mana pool to accommodate.<br/><br/>Even if it is not used to score a kill, Mana Burn can greatly hinder enemies' attempts to participate in teamfights. If enemies are unable to cast their full spell combo, or cast spells at all, they become worthless in teamfights, only able to auto-attack and possibly not even be able to use item abilities. This makes Mana Burn a powerful ability even against heroes who can withstand the damage nuke, as a Venomancer with no mana may be unable to afford the mana cost of Poison Nova alongside his other spells, a Phantom Assassin will be unable to use Phantom Strike to chase or escape, Wraith King will be unable to rely on Reincarnation, and so on.<br/><br/>Remember that Mana Burn will only deal its damage based on the amount of mana removed, meaning that it becomes worthless against targets that have already had their mana pools depleted. If an enemy has been completely drained of mana, it is best to use other damage nukes to finish them off.<br/><h4>Spiked Carapace</h4>Spiked Carapace allows Nyx Assassin to reflect hero damage back to its origin, stunning the attacker while leaving Nyx Assassin unharmed. It can only reflect the first instance per damage source, and only once per cast of Spiked Carapace.<br/><br/>Because it always lasts for the full 2.25 seconds, and is only useful if the enemy attempts to attack Nyx Assassin, Spiked Carapace should be given low priority for maxing out among his spells. One value point in the laning stage can give strong survivability, however the reduced cooldown and longer stun duration are not strictly necessary until later in the game.<br/><br/>Spiked Carapace is a very strong escape spell as it can be used to stun enemy initiators, delaying them from landing follow-up stuns. In the event that Nyx Assassin is ganked, casting Spiked Carapace can buy him enough time to escape or land a counter-stun with Impale.<br/><br/>Because it only reflects the first instance of hero damage, Spiked Carapace is strong against burst damage nukes but less effective against damage over time spells. While it can completely reflect large single-instance damage nukes like Assassinate and Laguna Blade, it is far less effective against multiple damage ticks like Dual Breath and Battery Assault.<br/><br/>Spiked Carapace's cooldown only allows it to be cast once at the start of an engagement, leaving it unable to be cast again until during the pursuit phase. As such, casting it at the right moment is crucial, as the long cooldown leaves little room for error.<br/><br/>Spiked Carapace can be used as a follow-up stun after a successful Impale. Activating Spiked Carapace right as the stun from Impale expires gives Nyx Assassin another opportunity to stun the target, as any counter-nukes or disables that deal damage will be reflected and stun the enemy again. This can be particularly useful against intelligence casters, who may try to target powerful nukes on Nyx Assassin that can be reflected in their full to add to Nyx Assassin's alpha.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Spiked Carapace only reflects the damage portion of any spell damage, and Nyx Assassin is still fully affected by secondary effects; Light Strike Array and Storm Hammer will still stun, Frost Blast and Venomous Gale will still slow, and so on. Spiked Carapace should not generally be treated as an invulnerability spell, as the enemy can still disable Nyx Assassin for enough time until the spell expires.<br/><br/>Against certain enemies, Spiked Carapace can allow Nyx Assassin to turn their skillshots against them while saving his own life. Knowing when the enemy may attempt to cast long-ranged nukes like Powershot, Rocket Flare, Sun Strike, and even Ice Blast can allow Nyx Assassin to use Spiked Carapace to block the damage instance and deflect it back, possibly even getting a kill if the caster is low enough.<br/><br/>Good timing and reflexes are crucial for effectively using Spiked Carapace, as its instant cast time and short duration can make it hard to use. Activating Spiked Carapace too early can warn the enemy not to cast any damage spells at Nyx Assassin until it expires, while activating it too late will cause Nyx Assassin to take the full damage from an incoming nuke and possibly be disabled and unable to cast it. Casting it at the right time can allow Nyx Assassin to fully reflect powerful damage nukes and stun numerous enemies while remaining relatively unharmed.<br/><br/>Remember that all sources of hero damage can be used to proc Spiked Carapace's stun, which allows Nyx Assassin to use the enemy's area nukes against them. For instance, activating Spiked Carapace on top of Firefly, March of the Machines, Scorched Earth and even an active Radiance can stun the enemy even if they are not trying to directly target Nyx Assassin, which allows it to be used to stun enemies chasing a fleeing ally, stop a retreating enemy in their tracks, and even interrupt escape teleports.<br/><h4>Vendetta</h4>Vendetta renders Nyx Assassin instantly invisible, while giving him a movement speed boost and unit-walking. Attacking out of invisibility allows him to deal tremendous physical damage to its target.<br/><br/>Because it deals physical damage, Vendetta is well-suited to hunting down heroes with low health and armor, particularly intelligence supports. Striking out of invisibility, and then following up with Impale and Mana Burn, are often enough to bring most squishy supports into the red instantly, if not outright kill them.<br/><br/>Be extremely careful about using Vendetta to initiate. Smart enemy players will buy detection early on in order to detect incoming ganks, turning Nyx Assassin into a free kill. Try to initiate only on lone enemies if possible, and don't be afraid to back away if something doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>While the physical backstab damage is very powerful, there may be times where it can be necessary to cast Impale from invisibility in order to disable the enemy. As Vendetta's cooldown allows it to be cast tactically, not utilizing the backstab damage is not the worst thing in the world.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Vendetta can be cast as an escape spell, provided that the enemy does not have detection. The instant fade time can disjoint incoming projectiles, while the movement speed boost can allow him to more easily clear the area.<br/><br/>Spiked Carapace can be cast during an active Vendetta without breaking invisibility. If an enemy damage nuke is incoming during Vendetta (a sign that they have detection), activating Spiked Carapace can allow Nyx Assassin to reflect the damage while stunning the enemy, and still have the backstab damage available to use.<br/><br/>Because it does not interrupt channeling, Vendetta can be cast during Town Portal Scroll, allowing Nyx Assassin to emerge invisible at his destination.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Circlet and Mantle of Intelligence provide Nyx Assassin with basic attributes, particularly to his intelligence to boost his mana pool so that he is able to cast his spells more easily. Both components can build directly into a Null Talisman.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Nyx Assassin to replenish his mana pool in-lane, crucial since most of his spells will consume almost half his base mana pool with a single cast. Having the mana to continue casting gives Nyx Assassin more chances to use his disables to score kills.<br/><br/>Tango and Healing Salve give Nyx Assassin basic health sustain, allowing him to continue laning despite enemy harass.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed allows Nyx Assassin to chase or flee enemies more easily, and is important for getting within range to cast Impale on a gank target.<br/><br/>Null Talisman provides a good spread of attributes, particularly boosting Nyx Assassin's intelligence to give him more mana. It can be upgraded directly into a Dagon if needed.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is important to get early on Nyx Assassin, as he can easily get charges from successful ganks. It provides strength for more HP, as well as mana regen for sustaining his mana pool. The charges can be used to restore any HP lost during a gank, or can be used to add more damage to a future gank to increase the odds of success.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots are crucial to obtain in order to allow Nyx Assassin to roam for ganks. It increases the size of Nyx Assassin's mana pool, allowing him to more easily cast his full combo of spells, and boosts his movement speed slightly to provide extra mobility. Most importantly, the active allows Nyx Assassin to replenish his own mana pool in order to ensure that he is able to continue roaming without needing to return to base as often.<br/><br/>Dagon greatly boosts Nyx Assassin's burst alpha, giving him much more kill potential. The item boosts his intelligence, allowing him to more easily cast his spells, while the active can be added on top of Impale and Mana Burn to deal tremendous burst damage to a single target to secure a kill.<br/>Dagon should only be considered when playing core/offlane Nyx. On a support Nyx, consider it a luxury item when things are going smoothly.<br/><br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to have on all heroes at all times. Nyx Assassin's ability to initiate and kill using Vendetta means that global positioning is key for allowing him to capitalize on any opportunities to secure kills.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter unlocks Burrow, which can give Nyx Assassin a strong tactical advantage against certain enemies. It also improves his overall attributes, aiding in his survivability and buffing up his mana pool.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger greatly increases Nyx Assassin's mobility, allowing him to jump on top of enemies and initiate without relying on Vendetta. In particular, being able to quickly re-position to cast Impale can allow Nyx Assassin to stun multiple enemy heroes at the start of a fight, and in a pinch Spiked Carapace can be used to prevent enemy initiating nukes from putting it on cooldown.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a handy utility item that grants Nyx Assassin many strong bonuses. It provides more intelligence for increasing the size of his mana pool, as well as HP regen for sustaining his health pool. The active greatly improves Nyx Assassin's mobility, allowing him to re-position for casting his spells, or chasing and escaping more easily. In a pinch, it can also be used as a cheap way to break an enemy Linken's Sphere prior to landing other disables and nukes, and can even be used to re-position Nyx Assassin during Burrow.<br/><br/>Aether Lens will increase Impale and Mana Burn's cast range, which is good to offset their terrible cast animation. It can be built by recycling the Energy Booster you got from Arcane Boots. The spell amp is always nice, especially on a nuker like Nyx.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade is a strong nuke booster that improves Nyx Assassin's ability to burst down enemies. As his primary attribute is agility, the bonus agility will increase the damage that Ether Blast deals, which will also greatly slow its target's movement speed while weakening their magic resistance, leaving them wide open for Impale, Mana Burn and Dagon.<br/><br/>Observer Ward can be useful to purchase on Nyx Assassin, as he is a very heavy roamer who can place wards before or after ganks to spot out enemy movement to strike again.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango is a strong laning item, as it provides a small boost to HP regeneration, augmenting his innate base HP regen to greatly increase his survivability in the off-lane. It can also be consumed for instant mana replenishment to be able to cast one more disable or nuke to secure a kill.<br/><br/>Stout Shield can greatly increase Nyx Assassin's resistance against harass damage when off-laning. Along with his innate HP regen, the damage block can keep his HP full and able to continue gaining gold and experience. It can further be upgraded into a Poor Man's Shield which could help you grab some last hits thanks to the +6 agility it provides.<br/><br/>Bottle is a very strong self-sustain item that allows Nyx Assassin to replenish his HP and mana, increasing his autonomy. As he constantly roams, Nyx is able to easily pick up runes to refill his Bottle, and utilize the runes during ganks as needed.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a strong casting item that boosts Nyx Assassin's ability to roam and gank. The increased intelligence and mana regen help to sustain his spell casting, ensuring that he doesn't have to return to base to replenish mana, and the increased movement speed gives him more mobility for hunting down enemies. The cyclone can be used to dispel debuffs from Nyx Assassin while providing temporary invulnerability, or can be cast on an enemy as a further disable.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives Nyx Assassin an instant ranged hard disable, useful in many situations. Also, it gives him stats across the board, particularly improving his intelligence for more mana and providing powerful scaling mana regeneration to allow him to roam independently.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is an expensive investment, but greatly increases Nyx Assassin's ability to move around and secure kills for his team. The increased movement speed makes it easier to scout and roam for kills, particularly when further boosted by Vendetta, and the global teleport allows him to show up to get kills whenever opportunities present themselves. As well, it provides a way to easily return to base to retrieve items and replenish HP and mana, or quickly return to the field after respawning.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord can be a good alternative to the usual dagon as it's built from the same Null Talismans but gives better overall stats. If you're not getting any pickoffs by yourself, Veil will increase your team's magic damage as well as your own.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is an unorthodox utility item to build on Nyx Assassin, but can be useful in certain situations. The ability to summon minions to assist him during ganks can increase the odds of getting a kill, and upgrading to level 3 Necronomicon provides True Sight that can debilitate an enemy's chances of using invisibility spells to escape. It also provides teamfight contribution, adding damage output on top of Nyx Assassin's disables and nukes.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade does not give Nyx Assassin many strong attribute benefits, but can be a strong utility item nonetheless. While Nyx Assassin does not rely on his physical attacks to deal damage outside of Vendetta, he can use Diffusal Blade's purge to pin down enemies and remove their buffs during ganks, or to remove debuffs from himself if he is being chased by the enemy.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb allows Nyx Assassin to further use the enemy's spells against them on top of Spiked Carapace. Echo Shell can give Nyx Assassin a 5 second window with which to reflect enemy spells rather than 2.25, and even though it doesn't block the damage done by these spells it can reflect debuffs and stuns rather than just the damage. It also provides armor, increasing Nyx Assassin's survivability, and HP and mana regen for self-sustain.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence provides Nyx Assassin with a soft disable that can greatly improve his ability to gank and kill enemies. By silencing an enemy during a gank, Nyx Assassin can prevent them from casting retaliatory disables to get away; as well, his high burst damage can take advantage of the burn damage at the end of the silence to increase the odds of getting a kill during a gank. The item also provides increased intelligence and mana regen, further improving Nyx Assassin's ability to roam independently.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a useful stat booster that is easy to build. It gives Nyx Assassin all-around attributes, improving his HP, attack damage and mana. The aura can be very useful, as it boosts Nyx Assassin's movement speed, allowing him to chase down enemies more quickly.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila provides Nyx Assassin with an assortment of attributes, as well as increasing his armor and providing some mana regen. It is a good cheap stat-booster that helps to sustain his mana pool.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere greatly improves Nyx Assassin's survivability, and allows him to engage and gank enemies through single-target disables. The Spellblock allows Nyx Assassin to ignore any targeted disables that enemies may try to hit him with, allowing him to continue pursuit and kill the enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Assassin is a carry renowned for her innate chance to deal massive critical damage, often killing enemies with a single swing. She specializes in hunting down vulnerable heroes, slowing them with a Stifling Dagger and leaping past defenses with Phantom Strike. Like other carries, Phantom Assassin needs a decent amount of gold and items to be effective. Because of her complete dependence on landing physical crits, she is susceptible to disables and must rely on a Black King Bar in most teamfights.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high burst damage.<br/><br/>Has natural evasion.<br/><br/>Has a cheap, long-range slow with good damage.<br/><br/>Fairly mobile.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on pseudo-random distribution.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/><br/>Highly dependent on Black King Bar.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Be mindful that Phantom Assassin is largely a single-target damage hero with low disable potential, so she is unable to deal with multiple targets simultaneously. Target prioritization is key, as Phantom Assassin must precisely eliminate her foes one at a time and cannot afford to be kited.<br/><br/>Despite possessing extremely low base intelligence and intelligence growth, Phantom Assassin has only two low-cost active abilities, so she rarely runs into mana problems and does not have to go out of her way to increase the size of her mana pool. As well, her small mana pool allows her to benefit disproportionately from burst mana regen, such as Magic Wand, allied Arcane Boots and Chakra Magic, letting her focus on building items to increase her damage output and carry potential.<br/>Beware that this can also be used against Phantom Assassin as well, as destroying her meager mana pool with abilities like Mana Break, EMP and Mana Drain can render her unable to cast her spells or use item active abilities in a teamfight. The same applies to abilities that manipulate her intelligence like Arcane Orb and Intelligence Steal, which also renders her extremely vulnerable to Sanity's Eclipse.<br/><br/>Be mindful that since she relies on two passive abilities for survival and damage output, Phantom Assassin is very vulnerable to break-type abilities, particularly Silver Edge. Removing her ability to evade physical attacks, as well as deal crits, can render her impotent in fights.<br/><br/><br/>As with most other agility carries, Phantom Assassin is very weak against burst Magical and Pure damage. While she gains respectable amounts of armor through her high agility growth and can evade attacks through Blur, her mediocre strength results in a health pool that can be easily shredded by spells. This also includes items such as Blade Mail, which can allow enemies to turn Phantom Assassin's high physical damage output against her.<br/><br/>All of the above make building spell immunity very important on Phantom Assassin. The ability to block mana-destroying abilities, block break debuffs, and ignore magic nukes allows Phantom Assassin to survive long enough to eliminate key enemies during engagements.<br/><br/>As a hard carry, Phantom Assassin is limited in the ways that she can be laned.<br/>In standard situations, Phantom Assassin is played as a safe lane carry who is safeguarded by at least one support. She spends the laning stage accumulating last-hits and surviving enemy harass, trying to farm the items she needs to begin operating independently. As she possesses a slow and nuke in Stifling Dagger and a chasing/escaping spell in Phantom Strike, Mortred is capable of assisting her lanemates in setting up and getting kills on the enemy off-laner, and can dodge ganks fairly reliably if given an opportunity to cast Phantom Strike.<br/><br/>Depending on the lane opponent, Phantom Assassin can be played as a solo mid. While she lacks base damage and can be easy to harass when approaching for last-hits, Stifling Dagger allows her to safely get last-hits at range and harass the enemy constantly. Both Stifling Dagger and Phantom Strike can be used as disabling and initiating spells when allied supports rotate mid for ganks, and the solo experience and gold can allow Phantom Assassin to start being effective earlier on.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Stifling Dagger</h4>Stifling Dagger is a multi-purpose spell that gives Phantom Assassin the ability to deal damage outside of melee range. It is a good ability to consider maxing out first, as its slow duration and damage scale up while its mana cost goes down.<br/><br/>In general, Stifling Dagger is a good ability to get last-hits with, as its extremely long cast range lets Phantom Assassin kill enemy creeps outside of harass range. It can also be used in turn to harass lane opponents and wear down their health over time, though beware of enemies purchasing Magic Stick to counteract this in-lane.<br/><br/>Stifling Dagger's long cast range allows Phantom Assassin to damage enemies at ranges where they may think that they are safe. Among its uses are to cancel enemy regeneration, such as from Healing Salve and Clarity, which can give Phantom Assassin a laning advantage.<br/><br/>Used as a disable, Phantom Assassin can cast Stifling Dagger to greatly slow enemies to prevent them from easily escaping, allowing her and her allies to kill them more easily. As well, it can be used to cover a teammate's escape, slowing a pursuing enemy so that they cannot get within range to attack or cast disables.<br/><br/>Stifling Dagger deals a regular attack by Phantom Assassin on its target, which can inflict attack modifiers and proc chance-based modifiers at range. This allows Phantom Assassin to take greater advantage of Unique Attack Modifiers than most other carries, as she can utilize these modifiers at long range against a variety of opponents.<br/><br/>Stifling Dagger can also be used as a way to disable enemies from afar due to on-hit effects of some items like Skull Basher and Monkey King Bar. With items like these, Phantom Assassin can disable channeling spells and Town Portal Scrolls without even being in melee range.<br/><h4>Phantom Strike</h4>Phantom Strike is a pseudo-blink ability that teleports Phantom Assassin to the target unit, boosting her attack speed when attacking a targeted enemy.<br/><br/>Leveling up Phantom Strike reduces its cooldown, increasing Phantom Assassin's mobility, both for chasing and escaping. Reducing the cooldown allows Phantom Assassin to continually stick to fleeing enemies and pursue them over great distances if needed.<br/><br/>As Phantom Strike can be targeted on both allies and enemies alike, it can be cast as an escape spell to get away from pursuing enemies. To this end, also keep in mind that allies do not have to be at the same elevation as Phantom Assassin, so it can be used to scale cliffs and transit trees to put terrain between Mortred and her pursuers.<br/><br/>Given its low mana cost and cooldown, Phantom Strike can be useful for boosting Phantom Assassin's attack speed when farming creeps, particularly neutral camps. However, keep in mind that the attack speed bonus only applies so long as she is attacking the target of the Phantom Strike, so use it only when it is necessary to focus down a creep over repeated attacks.<br/><br/>When used to jump on top of enemy heroes, try to combine Phantom Strike with a leading Stifling Dagger. Stifling Dagger deals small initial damage, slows and provides vision over the target, allowing Phantom Assassin to get within range to Phantom Strike, attacking them while they are slowed and preventing them from easily kiting her. If time and range permits, try to close in to Phantom Strike range first, and jump onto the target right as Stifling Dagger connects in order to maximize the number of attacks made on the slowed enemy.<br/><br/>Be very careful about which targets are chosen for Phantom Strike, and be wary about over-committing. Phantom Assassin's tremendous damage output makes it tempting to jump onto any potential target, but beware that enemies can bait her into a disadvantageous position far from allied support. As well, certain enemies with point-blank disables such as Slithereen Crush and Berserker's Call can instantly stun Mortred when she jumps on top of them, and supports with a Ghost Scepter can simply become ethereal to become immune to her attacks.<br/><br/>Combined with Helm of the Dominator, Phantom Strike can always ensure that Phantom Assassin has an escape route. Positioning a dominated creep in an area of safety while farming can allow her to instantly jump away if enemies attempt to gank her, and the creep can also be used to scout for vision as needed.<br/><br/>Be mindful that Phantom Strike does not disjoint incoming enemy projectiles. Simply putting distance between Phantom Assassin and any pursuers may not be enough to ensure safety, as targeted stuns can still follow her, and area disables like Storm Hammer, Fortune's End and Concussive Shot also run the risk of disabling the ally that Phantom Assassin jumps to.<br/><h4>Blur</h4>Blur grants Phantom Assassin evasion against physical attacks, as well as shrouding her from mini-map vision when no enemies are nearby.<br/><br/>A value point in Blur in the laning stage can aid Phantom Assassin's survivability against enemy harass. However, given the strong utility of her other abilities, it is best saved as the last ability to max out.<br/><br/>Beware that smart enemies almost always build Monkey King Bar in order to counter Blur, so do not rely on it for protection against physical attacks in the late game. Regardless, it can still buy Phantom Assassin survivability in the mid game and ensure that enemies have a much harder time trying to kill her before they are able to complete it.<br/><br/>Be mindful that even if the enemy does not build Monkey King Bar, they may have ways to reliably burst down Phantom Assassin without the need to rely on physical attacks. When facing teams with heavy burst nukes, it may be wise not to skill Blur past the value point and take Attribute Bonus instead, to boost Phantom Assassin's health, armor and base damage.<br/><br/>In general, Blur is best used to punish enemies for picking heroes that cannot greatly benefit from purchasing Monkey King Bar. For instance, Phantom Lancer's illusions can only benefit from the True Strike and not from the raw damage and attack speed, while the same applies to Chaos Knight. In other cases, Sven cannot boost the power of God's Strength as it does not provide bonus strength, and Riki cannot buy an agility item to increase the damage of Cloak and Dagger, which can limit their upper effectiveness once they are six-slotted.<br/><br/>Blur's ability to hide Phantom Assassin on the mini-map allows her to push and farm in areas where other carries cannot do so as safely. Unless the enemy is directly checking lanes that they are not present in, they may be unaware that Phantom Assassin is in that area.<br/><br/>The blurring effect allows Phantom Assassin to know when enemies are near her, so long as they are not invisible. If the blur effect around her body and the status icon disappear, it likely means that an enemy hero is nearby, and Phantom Assassin can take action accordingly.<br/><h4>Coup de Grace</h4>Coup de Grace is what allows Phantom Assassin to be such a threatening hard carry, as building agility items can tremendously boost her damage output through increased attack speed for more proc chances and more attack damage for larger crits. Because decisions made during engagements are based on expectations of damage output and survivability, Phantom Assassin can throw off enemies' expectations through sudden and surprise crits, causing them to re-think how they want to engage her team.<br/><br/>When fighting, try to determine which enemy heroes can be quickly eliminated with Coup de Grace, and take them out of the picture before they can take part in the fight. Phantom Assassin's ability to deal sudden burst physical damage can allow her to eliminate squishy supports with powerful teamfight items and spells before they know what hit them.<br/><br/>Because it uses pseudo-random distribution, Coup de Grace can be hard to utilize effectively. Failing to proc the ability increases the chances of it proccing for the next attack, so stacking up a few regular attacks before engaging an enemy can increase the chances of landing an opening crit.<br/><br/>Remember that as the same crit chance is applied to Stifling Dagger, Phantom Assassin can potentially use it to deal tremendous damage at range. Mind that its distribution is kept as a separate variable from Phantom Assassin's attacks, so proccing a crit with one does not reduce the chances of proccing a crit with the other.<br/><br/>In general, it is best to build items that grant both attack speed and damage, rather than focusing on one or the other. Phantom Strike can be used to increase the proc chance in a given engagement through increased attack speed, however it cannot be relied on as a steady source of proc chance.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tangos provide basic regen to stay in lane and continue farming despite enemy harassment. Given that Phantom Assassin is an agility melee carry who must close in to get last-hits, regen is important to ensure that she can survive the early game and transition smoothly into farming by herself.<br/><br/>Iron Branches give a very cost-effective increase to Phantom Assassin's attributes, and can be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Stout Shield helps reduce harass damage taken from lane opponents, increasing survivability.<br/><br/>Quelling Blade can be crucial for increasing Phantom Assassin's farming ability in the early game. Being able to last-hit more easily and kill neutral camps faster allows her to farm the items she needs to start becoming effective in a match.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are important to obtain early on. Phantom Assassin must be able to easily move in and out of range to last-hit, as well as chase or escape as needed without having to rely as much on Phantom Strike.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield provides increased damage block, and additional agility for more base damage and armor. It can greatly improve Phantom Assassin's lane survivability and aid in getting last-hits.<br/><br/>Magic Wand can greatly improve Phantom Assassin's survivability and effectiveness in the early game. It provides a small amount of attributes and tremendous charge storage for burst health and mana regen, both of which are crucial on an agility hero with low strength and intelligence.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is crucial to carry at all times. As a hard carry, Phantom Assassin is the linchpin of her team, and her absence in teamfights can be greatly detrimental to her team's chances of victory.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila is a strong stat item that greatly aids Phantom Assassin in the early game. It provides agility and bonus damage to improve Phantom Assassin's last-hitting power, and the flat mana regen aura replenishes a larger fraction of Phantom Assassin's pitiful mana pool than it does for other heroes, allowing her to utilize her spells more regularly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads boosts Phantom Assassin's combat effectiveness and survivability greatly. The extra attack speed increases her damage output, whether it is for attacking heroes or creeps; with greater attack speed comes more chances for proccing Coup de Grace. Attribute switching is very important, as it can be switched to strength for more health, agility for more damage output, or intelligence for using spells, particularly for repeated casting of Stifling Dagger.<br/><br/>Desolator is a useful utility mid-game item that can be built relatively easily. It allows Phantom Assassin to apply the armor debuff from long range with Stifling Dagger, softening up multiple targets for her team and for her own attacks. The damage boost also greatly improves the killing power of Coup de Grace, particularly when combined with the armor reduction on enemies that Phantom Assassin jumps on.<br/><br/>Black King Bar gives Phantom Assassin much-needed spell immunity, allowing her to ignore enemy disables and nukes as she directly engages enemies in fights. The extra health helps increase survivability, while the damage improves attack power.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Phase Boots can be situationally useful over Power Treads depending on how they are utilized. The bonus damage helps with last-hitting and increases the potency of Coup de Grace, while the extra movement speed allows Phantom Assassin to more easily chase down enemies or flee when both Phantom Strike and Stifling Dagger cannot be relied on.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator provides health regeneration and attack speed, keeping Phantom Assassin healthy and improving her damage output. The active ability allows access to useful neutral creep abilities, such as the Alpha Wolf's Packleader's Aura, the Satyr Banisher's Purge and the Ogre Frostmage's Ice Armor. The dominated creep can also be used to escape fights by providing a Phantom Strike target.<br/><br/>Battle Fury is a strong item for allowing Phantom Assassin to secure her ability to farm into the late game. The damage and cleave allow her to easily clear bunches of creeps, whether it is for farming or pushing/counter-pushing, while the health and mana regen ensure that she can always maintain her health and mana pools while farming.<br/><br/>Satanic improves Phantom Assassin's survivability in teamfights, allowing her to quickly refill health with Coup de Grace crits. However, it is a Unique Attack Modifier that does not stack with Desolator, so consider your purchases carefully.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness provides an alternate source of lifesteal and attack speed. Phantom Assassin's survivability is based on evasion instead of armor and her damage comes from a passive ability, partially offsetting the debuff, but not being able to use Stifling Dagger or Phantom Strike can be costly when trying to chase or flee, making this item a dangerous purchase.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade can be crucial for giving Phantom Assassin the lockdown and damage she needs to quickly eliminate key opponents in fights. The bash gives her a chance to stun an enemy after jumping on them with Phantom Strike, while the active allows her to instantly hard-disable any foe through spell immunity, long enough to bring them down with Coup de Grace. It also increase her survivability giving bonus health and health regeneration and blocking 40 damage from incoming attacks.<br/><br/>Butterfly greatly boosts Phantom Assassin's damage output, as well as providing additional evasion. While stacking it alongside Blur runs the risk of having both nullified by the enemy building Monkey King Bar, purchasing a Butterfly can punish certain lineups by forcing their heroes to purchase Monkey King Bar over a different item that synergizes better with their strengths. As well, Butterfly's active allows Phantom Assassin to more easily chase or flee in circumstances where Phantom Strike proves impossible to use.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is useful as a utility substitute over Helm of the Dominator. It provides many of the same bonuses, but despite its higher cost it is not registered as a Unique Attack Modifier, giving Phantom Assassin the option to purchase one that synergizes better with Stifling Dagger.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar is a situationally useful damage item to build in order to counter enemy evasion. As well, the increased damage and attack speed is one of the best options for increasing Phantom Assassin's damage output as she does not benefit as much comparatively from building a Daedalus due to her ultimate.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass greatly increases Phantom Assassin's damage output through more attack speed as well as the enemy armor reduction aura. The improved armor also greatly increases her survivability against physical damage, and the aura helps give teammates more armor and attack speed as well, which can be very useful depending on team composition.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a useful purchase in the laning stage that helps Phantom Assassin to secure kills alongside her team. Combined with Stifling Dagger, it can reduce an enemy's movement speed by up to 62% from long range.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is useful for allowing Phantom Assassin to fight earlier instead of attempting to farm for extended periods of time. Its easy buildup allows it to be purchased quickly, and it provides all-around attributes, particularly strength and intelligence to boost Phantom Assassin's health and mana pools. The aura increases her movement and attack speed, allowing her to be more mobile in fights, and the active is a powerful combat booster that gives her and her team an edge in teamfights.<br/><br/>Skull Basher can be a strong mid-game purchase in order to give Phantom Assassin some lockdown once she has acquired enough attack speed. Jumping on top of an enemy with Phantom Strike can give her a chance to stun enemies, stopping them in their tracks while Phantom Assassin continues to damage them. The extra strength gives her some more health for survivability, while the damage increases the potency of Coup de Grace.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade is a situationally strong utility damage item in Phantom Assassin's hands. It boosts her agility and intelligence, giving her more damage output and mana, and the active can remove buffs from enemies while greatly slowing them for her to jump on.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is a situationally powerful mid-game item that is easy to farm and allows Phantom Assassin to begin participating in teamfights earlier. The agility and strength-based bonuses give her more damage output and health, while the movement speed makes her far more mobile, allowing her to chase and escape far more easily. Greater Maim can slow enemies down and prevent them from running away from her, and has a chance to proc with Stifling Dagger as well, potentially slowing an enemy by up to 82% movement speed.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is a powerful carry item and can greatly boost Phantom Assassin's combat effectiveness. It grants stats across the board, giving Phantom Assassin more health, mana and base damage. The Unique Attack Modifier can be used alongside lifesteal, and allows Phantom Assassin to slow enemies with her attacks and Stifling Dagger, greatly reducing their movement speed and preventing them from easily escaping her.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is a very rarely built item, but can be used for double Satanic active, refreshing the cooldown of Black King Bar, and other uses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Phantom Lancer is an exceptional carry who outnumbers and overwhelms his targets with armies of illusions. With the ability to charge at his opponents, the Phantom Lancer is relatively mobile, and can disappear briefly from the battlefield to confuse or avoid his enemies. Indistinguishable from with his clones, enemies often have a hard time targeting the real Phantom Lancer during fights. However, the Phantom Lancer's illusions can be destroyed by area of effect abilities, rendering him less effective as a result.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Creates confusion with large numbers of illusions.<br/><br/>Excellent disjoint and dispel mechanism with Doppelganger.<br/><br/>Good chase potential with Phantom Rush.<br/><br/>Fast, clean attack animation.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on illusions.<br/><br/>Weak against AoE abilities.<br/><br/>Low health.<br/><br/>No burst damage.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>As with other illusion-dependent heroes, Phantom Lancer should build items that provide stats and passive buffs rather than raw damage or attack speed, because those stats and buffs are transferred to his illusions.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade is the most important item for Phantom Lancer. In the early game, most of his damage against heroes will come from Diffusal Blade's mana burn.<br/>A hero with mana will take more damage from Phantom Lancer than one who is out of mana, meaning that Phantom Lancer starts off dealing more damage, and less once the target's mana is drained.<br/><br/>Because of this, Phantom Lancer sometimes has difficulties finishing off tough, retreating enemies like Timbersaw when they are already out of mana.<br/><br/>When fighting heroes with low mana like Sven, Phantom Lancer will do less damage overall because the target's small mana pool is quickly depleted.<br/><br/><br/>Phantom Lancer's illusion army will often overwhelm new to mid-level players, causing them to attack the wrong target and waste their abilities. However, this should not be your primary strategy, because more experienced players are usually able to discover the real Phantom Lancer by observing the amount of damage being dealt (most illusions take more damage), debuff status, as well as player movement patterns.<br/><br/>With enough micromanagement, you can deceive enemies by controlling illusions independently, and moving in ways you might move Phantom Lancer himself.<br/><br/>Moving illusions together in clumps usually tells enemies that they are illusions.<br/><br/>During smaller teamfights, staying inside a big group of illusions can make it harder for enemies to find the real Phantom Lancer.<br/>However, this tactic can backfire if enemy nukers target the entire group with AoE abilities. Make sure no nukers are nearby before grouping up.<br/><br/><br/>Remember to move Phantom Lancer himself when manipulating his illusions. A good tactic for newer players is to issue a distant move command for Phantom Lancer, while moving his illusions to trick the pursuing enemies.<br/><br/>Though attack speed is still important on Phantom Lancer, it is not needed as much due to his ability to create attacking illusions.<br/><br/>Get teammates to use buffs and abilities on an illusion to confuse enemies, such as Shallow Grave. This tactic is highly situational.<br/><br/>Illusions are counted as heroes in a target check, but they sometimes receive effects intended for units, letting the enemy tell them apart straight away.<br/>For example, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask will stun Phantom Lancer's illusions by 5 seconds, but only stun Phantom Lancer himself for 1 second.<br/><br/><br/>When choosing an item build, remember that not all passive item abilities are shared with illusions.<br/><br/>Read the Illusions article for a full understanding of how illusions work.<br/><br/>Phantom Lancer is a moderately good ganker, but still needs to farm items for the late game. Try to balance the two roles depending on what opportunities are present on the map.<br/><br/>Phantom Lancer has no strong disables, instead relying on speed and slows to catch up to his opponents.<br/><br/>Phantom Lancer is a decent split pusher, especially in the late game. Take advantage of this whenever you aren't fighting.<br/><br/>Phantom Lancer excels in long, drawn-out fights, which give him lots of time to wear down his opponents' mana and spawn more illusions.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Spirit Lance</h4>Spirit Lance is Phantom Lancer's generic nuke. Use it during the early game to supplement his damage during ganks and for harassment.<br/><br/>Use Spirit Lance during the laning phase to intimidate enemy laners, especially vulnerable supports.<br/><br/>Using Spirit Lance to get last hits can be worth it if Phantom Lancer is not farming well.<br/><br/>The illusion spawned from Spirit Lance has the same properties as every other illusion. It will burn the enemy's mana once you have Diffusal Blade, and spawn further illusions with Juxtapose.<br/><br/>Don't hesitate to use Spirit Lance on a squishy support in the back line rather than on the enemy carry you're currently focusing. Once you're farmed enough, it could force the support to back off by itself, or waste his precious AoE disable on the illusion army that gathered up around him.<br/><br/>If Phantom Lancer is too weak to join a fight, use Spirit Lance repeatedly from the edges to send an illusion to help your allies. The illusion could spawn an army of illusions by itself to confuse and mislead enemies, as well as burn their mana.<br/><br/>Spirit Lance's projectile is slow and very visible, and thus easily disjointed. Avoid wasting it on heroes who can dodge the projectile, such as Puck.<br/><br/>Spirit Lance's deceptively long cast range can be used to finish off an enemy during teamfights.<br/><br/>Spirit Lance's short cooldown means it can be used to initiate and finish off fleeing opponents.<br/><br/>Use Spirit Lance on an enemy who is just about to move out of vision, such as up high ground or into the trees. The illusion that spawns next to them will grant vision.<br/><br/>If your illusion is not auto-attacking its target after impact, check your game settings. Do not have the Illusions → Never auto-attack option turned on when playing Phantom Lancer. But, while trying to juke with Doppelganger, you don't want use the Illusions → Always auto-attack option either, as the opponent will immediately spot which is the real hero. Find the compromise.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Doppelganger</h4>Doppelganger's short cast time allows Phantom Lancer to easily dodge Fortune's End.<br/><h4>Phantom Rush</h4>Once Phantom Rush starts, Phantom Lancer will not stop until he either reaches the target, loses vision of the target, gets disabled, or is given a move command.<br/><br/>Be careful not to inadvertently initiate with Phantom Rush, or charge into a bad situation. Cancel the rush with a move command if necessary.<br/><br/>Phantom Rush's extra movement speed makes it a good chasing mechanism against heroes with movement speed buffs, like Surge, Shukuchi, Stampede or even Shapeshift.<br/><br/>Phantom Lancer cannot be slowed during Phantom Rush. Use this to charge to and between enemies in teamfights, picking off supports and dying heroes.<br/><br/>At level 3, Phantom Rush has a longer cast range than Spirit Lance, making it a better initiation tool in some scenarios.<br/><br/>Early levels in Phantom Rush can be useful for a ganking or mid Phantom Lancer.<br/><br/>In some situations, Phantom Rush can be used as an escape tool, if there is an enemy target close enough for you to rush, and is far from the rest of the enemy team.<br/><br/>With Phantom Lancer's level 25 talent, Phantom Rush becomes an extremely long ranged charge, allowing Phantom Lancer to run to any enemy during a teamfight, and chase down fleeing stragglers.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Juxtapose</h4>Like every passive, Juxtapose is disabled by break, such as from Silver Edge. When this happens, Phantom Lancer loses the ability to passively spawn illusions, and becomes very vulnerable to single target abilities like Primal Roar or Doom.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items</b><br/>Tango helps keep Phantom Lancer longer alive during the early game.<br/><br/>Healing Salve is a standard regeneration item, useful for any hero to stay longer in lane.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango helps Phantom Lancer endure harassment, and can be consumed to get off one last Spirit Lance or Doppelganger.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection is one of the components for a Ring of Basilius, which builds later into Ring of Aquila, but it cannot be purchased at the side shop.<br/><br/>Iron Branches provides an extremely cost effective increase to his attributes, and can later be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game</b><br/>Ring of Aquila is a cheap way to get some damage and mana regeneration, so Spirit Lance can be used more often.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is a useful tool for keeping Phantom Lancer alive, especially when being ganked. It also provides a little more mana to use an extra Spirit Lance or Doppelganger.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield is recommended when facing physical harassment in lane.<br/><br/>Infused Raindrop is recommended when facing magical harassment in lane. It also provides some protection against magical nukers, which are often picked against Phantom Lancer.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items</b><br/>Power Treads give Phantom Lancer stats and attack speed, which illusions can take advantage of, and makes it easier to proc Juxtapose.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade is the most important item for Phantom Lancer, because its mana burn works on all of his illusions, allowing Phantom Lancer to quickly deplete an opponent's mana.<br/>The mana burn damage is not reduced for his illusions, therefore greatly increases his damage output when more illusions are spawned.<br/><br/>The extra agility increases Phantom Lancer's primary attribute, giving him more damage.<br/><br/>The active Purge slows enemies, and combined with Phantom Rush, helps Phantom Lancer chase down enemies and overwhelm them with illusions.<br/><br/>Upgrading to a Diffusal Blade 2 is cheap and recommended, but mostly after the charges of Purge are expended.<br/><br/><br/>Manta Style will purges debuffs from Phantom Lancer, and provide him with a second disjoint mechanism. It can also be used to create extra illusions, which last longer and hit harder, and can multiply on their own with Juxtapose. Extra illusions are especially useful for split pushing against towers.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items</b><br/>Vladmir's Offering is often picked up to supplement Phantom Lancer's health through lifesteal, and help him last longer in teamfights.<br/><br/>Vanguard makes Phantom Lancer significantly tankier, and is useful for split pushing. For late game teamfights, it can be upgraded into an Abyssal Blade.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque provides Phantom Lancer with a large amount of much-needed HP, which carries over to his illusions, thus making them harder to kill. Phantom Lancer's natural elusiveness will make it easy for him to blend in with his illusions and regenerate mid-fight.<br/><br/>Butterfly is a damage item that is a worthwhile late-game pickup on most agility carries. Illusions will also benefit from the evasion, making them and Phantom Lancer himself much more durable.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha provides strength and agility, both of which are useful on Phantom Lancer, as well as his illusions. However, it is not recommended if Phantom Lancer already has a Manta Style, as the speed bonus from Yasha does not stack.<br/><br/>Daedalus is the final damage item that can be purchased if Phantom Lancer is struggling against tankier heroes. His illusions will also receive the critical strike bonus.<br/><br/>Radiance makes Phantom Lancer an intimidating pusher, as the burn damage aura works on his illusions, and enemies are unlikely to move out of its range due to Phantom Rush and Spirit Lance. The minor blind effect also helps Phantom Lancer stay alive.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel makes Phantom Lancer a powerful split-pusher in the late game, and also allows him to return to base after generating an illusion army to push down lanes.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi's passive slow benefits illusions, and works together with Diffusal Blade's mana burn, rendering enemies helpless and unable to escape Phantom Lancer.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade allows Phantom Lancer to stun targets, giving him the time to land multiple hits and generate illusions.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar is highly situational, and should only be purchased against evasion heroes, or in the late game as a luxury item. It provides a decent damage boost, and its mini-bash helps lock down targets, but does not work on Phantom Lancer's illusions.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is less common on Phantom Lancer than on other carries, but is sometimes necessary against enemies with numerous disables.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Razor is a fast, tough anti-carry who steals the attack power from his enemies, and transfers it to himself. Armed with a Desolator, he can quickly melt away armor with Eye of the Storm, allowing his team to cut through enemies with ease. However, Razor has no disables, and must rely on staying close to his targets and executing his abilities properly in order to be an effective damage dealer.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Counters carries.<br/><br/>Strong lane presence.<br/><br/>Good starting Strength and Agility.<br/><br/>Fast movement speed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on well-positioned abilities to deal damage.<br/><br/>Loses effectiveness against heroes with higher mobility.<br/><br/>Does not recover well from a bad early game.<br/><br/>No disables.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Razor can be played in all lanes, but is most commonly played in mid. Because of his speed and durability, he is not extremely dependent on supports.<br/><br/>Razor is surprisingly durable compared to many carries, especially in the early to mid game. This advantage falls off in the late game, however, making him a medium carry.<br/><br/>Compared to other carries, Razor's autoattacks deal little damage. In order to hit hard, Razor relies on his Static Link to steal enemy damage, and Eye of the Storm to reduce their armor.<br/><br/>Razor's abilities are dependent on positioning, requiring him to chase and remain close to his targets.<br/><br/>Razor's ability effects and sounds cannot be seen or heard by the enemy when he is invisible, allowing him to deal damage surreptiously with a Shadow Blade or other means of invisibility.<br/><br/>Razor's autoattacks have a small delay after its visual effect before the damage is dealt. Time your animations accordingly.<br/><br/>Razor should be thought of as a hybrid between tankiness and damage, and his item build should reflect whichever his team needs more.<br/><br/>With Unstable Current, Eye of the Storm, and a few defensive items, Razor should aim to dominate the battlefield by placing himself directly in the middle of the fight.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Plasma Field</h4>Try to catch enemies with the edge of Plasma Field's radius, as this will deal maximum damage.<br/>Consider moving away from the enemy after casting Plasma Field to accomplish this.<br/><br/><br/>Use Plasma Field to harass enemies in lane. Keep in mind that this will also push the lane, however.<br/><br/>Use Plasma Field to pick off invisible enemies, or enemies juking in the trees.<br/><br/>Use Plasma Field across high ground and barriers to intimidate or finish off enemies.<br/><br/>Since Plasma Field's expanding radius follows Razor as he moves, its range is deceptively large, and can be used early while Razor is approaching the target.<br/><br/>Use Plasma Field's wide radius to farm jungle creeps quickly by moving and hitting multiple camps at once.<br/><br/>Plasma Field's large area effect is visible to enemies across any terrain, and can therefore give away your position. Think twice before using it prior to a team gank or during a Roshan attempt.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Static Link</h4>Static Link is often leveled first as a means to zone out a laning opponent, reducing their damage so they cannot get last hits. Conversely, it also helps Razor get last hits by giving him more damage.<br/>Move close to the target, then use Static Link to drain them for as long as possible. Do not attack the enemy, as this will cause the lane creeps to turn on you, forcing you to retreat without stealing much damage.<br/><br/>Done correctly, this method allows Razor to dominate against a solo lane opponent.<br/><br/><br/>In teamfights, use Static Link on enemy carries as early as possible to transfer their damage to Razor.<br/><br/>Static Link cannot be purged by spell immunity, but cannot be cast on targets that are already spell immune. Use it before the enemy has a chance to activate their Black King Bar.<br/><br/>In teamfights, Static Link is most effective on melee carries, who will lose a good portion of their damage before they have a chance to attack Razor.<br/><br/>Because of its cast animation time, it is better to use Static Link when Razor is relatively close to the target. Using it from the maximum cast range will often allow the target to break the link before Razor can catch up.<br/><br/>During the late game, a good Static Link can make a big difference in teamfights by neutralizing the enemy carry.<br/>A quickly broken Static Link does not necessary spell defeat, but will cause Razor to do very little damage.<br/><br/><br/>Static Link will stay applied to Brewmaster when using Primal Split, and will continue to sap damage from the Earth elemental.<br/><br/>Blinking heroes like Anti-Mage or Queen of Pain can easily break Static Link. Make sure they are fully engaged in the fight before using it on them.<br/><h4>Unstable Current</h4>The speed increase from a single point in Unstable Current is usually enough until the late game.<br/><br/>Unstable Current has a particle effect whenever Razor is targeted by an ability, even if the enemy hero is far away and not in vision. Keep an eye out for this effect to determine the direction and position of the enemy through the fog of war.<br/><br/>Send Razor out in front to act as a lightning rod for enemy spellcasters. Opponents who target him will be damaged and dispelled.<br/><br/>Unstable Current does not trigger against area of effect abilities, such as Nether Blast.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Eye of the Storm</h4>Eye of the Storm's armor reduction has an compounding effect. The more times enemies are struck, the weaker they become, thus the more likely they are to be struck again.<br/><br/>Eye of the Storm is ineffective when creeps are nearby, as they will absorb many of the lightning strikes.<br/><br/>Razor can cause Eye of the Storm to target an enemy by attacking and bringing that enemy's health low.<br/><br/>Eye of the Storm can deal devastating damage to a single enemy, as long as Razor keeps the target within range. This is an easy way to get an early kill.<br/><br/>Because Eye of the Storm reduces armor, additional armor reducing items like Assault Cuirass and Desolator will let Razor and his team do heavy damage to an affected target.<br/><br/>Remember to move between attacks to keep enemies within Eye of the Storm's range.<br/><br/>Eye of the Storm's long duration means it should always be activated prior to a fight.<br/><br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Eye of the Storm allows Razor to take down buildings fairly quickly. Combined with its short cooldown, it can be used exclusively for pushing lanes.<br/>Eye of the Storm will not hit filler buildings.<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Iron Branch adds to Razor's already decent starting stats.<br/><br/>Tango helps Razor stay in lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Razor if used at the last moment.<br/><br/>Stout Shield protects Razor in lane, and is sometimes built into a Vanguard later.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Wand can help Razor get off an extra Plasma Field.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed is mandatory on all heroes. Combined with Unstable Current, it makes Razor one of the fastest heroes in the early game.<br/><br/>Bottle is commonly picked up if Razor is playing in mid, as his superior movement speed helps him reach runes faster.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is sometimes bought to make Razor move even faster.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila provides a well-rounded mix of damage, armor, and mana regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Power Treads gives Razor a good attack speed boost.<br/><br/>Phase Boots can be a good alternative, as it allows Razor to catch up to enemies and keep them within range of Static Link and Eye of the Storm.<br/><br/>Desolator's large armor reduction synergizes well with the armor reduction from Eye of the Storm.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha provides both extra speed and a slow effect, and helps Razor keep enemies within range of his abilities.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is often needed against enemies with numerous disables, which can prevent Razor from keeping up with enemies.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Shadow Blade allows Razor to use and pursue enemies with Static Link and Eye of the Storm without retaliation. The sounds and particle effects from his abilities cannot be seen or heard by the enemy when he is invisible, but will still do damage.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter upgrades Eye of the Storm's damage, and helps Razor take down buildings faster.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives Razor supreme durability, helping him stay alive and keep Eye of the Storm active as long as possible.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives a sizeable amount of health, and its slowing effect helps Razor keep enemies in range of his abilities.<br/><br/>Mekansm is sometimes picked up, as Razor relies more on his abilities to do damage.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance is popular to supplement Razor's attack range.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator helps Razor last longer in lane, increases his attack speed and allows him to dominate a creep to scout, use its abilities or rightclick.<br/><br/>Blade Mail deters enemies from attacking, letting Razor stay alive longer when using Static Link and Eye of the Storm.<br/><br/>Vanguard adds to Razor's defense, allowing him to take a more aggressive stance in teamfights.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb allows two instances of Eye of the Storm to be active at the same time, dealing heavy DPS and armor reduction.<br/>Combined with Aghanim's Scepter, this can deal twice the damage to buildings.<br/><br/><br/>Butterfly makes it much more difficult for enemy carries to take down Razor, which in turn means he has even more time to drain them damage.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass's armor reduction works well with Eye of the Storm, as well as Desolator.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Riki's permanent invisibility is both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. On one hand, it makes him able to surprise enemies and farm with very little concern. On the other hand, without invisibility he has no real defense. He still has to watch out for revealing items such as Dust of Appearance and Gem of True Sight, as well as abilities that prevent him from going invisible. If he stays alive and picks off lone enemies, he can quickly get out of control.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Permanent invisibility.<br/><br/>Can use items without breaking invisibility.<br/><br/>Relatively mobile.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health points.<br/><br/>Low health regeneration<br/><br/>Low mana.<br/><br/>Low base damage<br/><br/>Easily countered by wards and True Sight.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Riki is one of the best support and roamer in the game. The ability to place wards and sentry while invisible makes Riki a viable support hero and also scout area while permanently hidden makes Riki one of the best roamers in the game<br/><br/>Due to recent 6.87 riki is not a viable carry hero in late game as he is out carried by almost all carries in the game. Riki has a carry and support potential thus Riki should be played as a Semi-support.<br/><br/>Riki is exceptional at ganking lone heroes and picking them off one by one. He can snowball easily through just getting lots of kills even without farm. Try to get kills before the enemy starts grouping up, so they cannot punish you with detection items.<br/><br/>Riki is an attribute-based carry, thanks to Cloak and Dagger's backstab damage. This means that it continues to get stronger and stronger as the game goes on, as long as you continue to farm, gank, and purchase the right items.<br/>Because of this, Diffusal Blade should be your first core item completed, it gives everything Riki needs: the agility scales well with and the active Purge helps you in many applications, removing strong protections like Repel, Guardian Angel from enemies and purging them while inside of Smoke Screen, which is your main ganking combo. Always use all the charges before buying the recipe again and search to do the best use of them. Be warned however, Diffusal Blade no longer purges dust as it cannot be used on allies.<br/><br/><br/>Do not walk straight up to enemies and deep into enemy territory and expect never to die. If they have any kind of detection (e.g. Sentry Ward), then Riki dies very quickly.<br/>As a result of this, make a habit of constantly checking the enemy's inventory for revealing items.<br/><br/><br/>Be wary around more durable enemy heroes. Spell Immunity from Black King Bar allows enemies to ignore Smoke Screen and fight Riki, ignoring his backstab damage.<br/><br/>Riki is a key hero to catch slippery foes and heroes that are heavily reliant on their own active skills since he can approach without detection and use smoke to prevent them from using escape spells, so it is wise to pick him as a counter pick to many heroes like Slark, Juggernaut, Anti-Mage, Weaver or Storm Spirit. However, be careful of enemies carrying escape items, like Force Staff, Glimmer Cape, Blink Dagger or Shadow Blade/ Silver Edge.<br/><br/>Always scout the enemy jungle once in a while, you may encounter some enemy farming alone for an easy kill, also help high mobility heroes like Spirit Breaker or Nature's Prophet to set up a gank.<br/><br/>Do not be afraid of enemies carrying Gem of True Sight, track down their movement and wait, sooner or later they are going to end up alone and when this happens do not hesitate, use the fog of war and approach them from the sides, go for the kill and recover the Gem.<br/><br/>Riki requires a lot of map knowledge as some supports or players place sentry wards in obvious position. Knowing heroes who carry dust, knowing the range of the sentry detection and knowing hot spots for sentry placement can increase your overall survivability in the game<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Smoke Screen</h4>Smoke Screen provides a powerful Silence and gives enemies a high miss chance, as well as slowing them down.<br/><br/>If Smoke Screen targeted properly, it can hold an enemy down long enough to finish them off.<br/><br/>A good strategy is to throw a Smoke Screen in the enemy's path, rather than where they are presently.<br/><h4>Blink Strike</h4>Blink Strike can target allies and enemies. Jumping to a friendly unit can be useful in case Riki needs to escape.<br/><br/>Blink Strike is unit targeted, not point targeted, and as such cannot be used unless there are units around.<br/><br/>Blink Strike helps catch up with fleeing enemies, jump into fights quickly, and escape from situations by targeting allies.<br/><br/>Blink Strike pairs well with the backstab damage from Cloak and Dagger, as it teleports Riki behind the enemy.<br/><h4>Cloak and Dagger</h4>If Riki's enemies do not have any form of detection, the invisibility will let Riki escape with ease and roam freely.<br/>If they do, Riki has to rely on his cunning and speed in order to get the drop on enemies, and get out alive.<br/><br/><br/>You can take Cloak and Dagger as your first skill point and easily take the first Bounty Rune in either side of the river, unless the enemy has any form of detection.<br/><br/>Cloak and Dagger also enables him to deal incredible damage from behind based on a multiplier of his agility.<br/><br/>Since good supports always stay behind, you can flank the enemy team coming around from there and catching the supports as soon as a teamfight begins and the enemy team is so busy fighting yours that they do not realize that their supports are already dead. This strategy also applies to enemy initiators with game-breaking ultimates like Enigma or Magnus, as a good interruption can set victory in critical situations.<br/><br/>A well-organised team will often buy Sentry Ward to keep vision of Riki. You may want to take it upon yourself to de-ward your lane if needs be; if you are without a support, or so that your support can concentrate on other items.<br/><h4>Tricks of the Trade</h4>Tricks of the Trade pairs well with large AoE disables such as Ravage, Reverse Polarity, and Black Hole.<br/><br/>Later in the game, you can use Tricks of the Trade after Blink Strike to initiate, then safely Blink Strike again to escape enemies waiting for you.<br/><br/>Tricks of the Trade may be combined with cleave from Battle Fury or Empower to devastate closely grouped enemies.<br/><br/>Tricks of the Trade turns Riki invulnerable and hidden for a maximum of 5 seconds. Do not be afraid to use the skill to avoid dying from spells such as Assassinate.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting</b><br/>Tangos and Healing Salve compensate for poor starting HP, allowing you to stay longer in the lane and reach level 6 sooner.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility and three Iron Branches to increase early damage and both health and mana regeneration, while the slippers prepare for the shield and the branches set up for the wand later.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game</b><br/>Magic Stick replaces your consumables with an alternative source of recovery, particularly if the enemy team includes heroes that rely on abilities.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed provide movement speed, allowing Riki to keep pace with fleeing heroes while Blink Strike is on cooldown.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield gives Riki damage block, aiding escape from attempted ganks or providing the defense to land one last hit on an almost dead opponent.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom helps secure kills with its movement slow and helps compensate for Riki's own horrible movement speed. Remember that neither Orb of Venom nor Diffusal Blade are UAMs, so they stack with other ones.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core</b><br/>Power Treads give Riki increased attack speed as well as a further bonus to attributes.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is an obvious upgrade from the Magic Stick and Iron Branches purchased earlier, freeing up inventory slots while retaining the attribute bonuses and healing ability.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade provides a way to weaken heroes receiving bonuses from buffs, as well as slow fleeing heroes and burn mana from casters. And using purge on an enemy under Smoke Screen allows for a long silenced duration in which you can backstab them or just fight them while they have an increased chance to miss. It also boosts Agility which will increase Cloak and Dagger's backstab damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational</b><br/>Butterfly provides a huge increase in both survivability and damage, as well as attack speed. It also boosts your Agility which scales well with Cloak and Dagger's backstab damage.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a good early/mid game pickup, makes everyone faster and gives you stats, coupled with Orb of Venom for a better chasing power.<br/><br/>Black King Bar allows Riki to effectively fight in teamfights and get kills against opponents that have strong disables.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha give great attribute bonuses, as well as an alternative slow method to save charges on, or use in place of a drained Diffusal Blade.<br/><br/>Skull Basher allows Riki to cancel TPs with a lucky bash and continue to lockdown opponents once they have acquired a BKB, and upgrades into Abyssal Blade which allows for more reliable stuns.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives stats across the board as well as a flat HP and mana pool bonus, allowing Riki to take more hits, deal more damage and cast more spells. It also gives a powerful, BKB piercing slow that will prevent your target from escaping.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger allows Riki to initiate using Blink Strike and Tricks of the Trade, then safely blinking away just before Tricks of the Trade finishes.<br/><br/>Manta Style can be used to dispel debuffs, including Dust of Appearance, as it's the only source of dispel which has beneficial stats for Riki.<br/><br/>Battle Fury can be utilized when allies such as Enigma and/or Magnus are present.<br/><br/>Maelstrom can proc with Tricks of the Trade, but only up to once per strike due to the item's internal cooldown of 0.2 seconds. Can be upgraded to Mjollnir for higher damage.<br/><br/>Desolator can be used with Tricks of the Trade to hit multiple targets and reduce their armor, causing it to essentially be a multiple target Medallion of Courage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Fiend is a ranged carry who collects the soul of every unit he kills, growing stronger with each soul claimed. Because of this, he benefits from a high attack damage potential, but also suffer punishing setbacks if he dies. The Shadow Fiend can also unleash all the souls he has gathered, devastating enemies over a wide area with Requiem of Souls. While highly effective as an offensive hero, Shadow Fiend has no defensive abilities and needs help from teammates to position his abilities.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Gains damage from kills.<br/><br/>Fast farmer.<br/><br/>Good balance of early game magic damage and late game physical damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Loses damage upon dying.<br/><br/>No escape mechanism.<br/><br/>Requires good positioning.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Shadow Fiend is nearly always played in the mid lane.<br/><br/>Unlike other carries, Shadow Fiend's heavy damage depends on his Necromastery count. This means that dying will make him significantly weaker, especially in the late game.<br/><br/>Shadow Fiend has no movement or escape abilities, making him easily gankable. Make sure there are wards to spot any potential gankers moving to the mid lane.<br/><br/>Survivability is essential for Shadow Fiend early in the game.<br/>A Shadow Fiend with few souls will have a hard time regaining footing in the mid game.<br/><br/>Play conservatively and take few risks until he has a decent health pool and soul count.<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shadowraze</h4>Shadowraze's low mana cost means it can be used during the laning phase to score last hits and harass the enemy.<br/><br/>Shadowraze's nuke damage is considerable during the early game, and allows Shadow Fiend to gank.<br/><br/>Use Shadowraze early if you're having trouble building souls. A level 1 Shadowraze deals 100 damage, which is much higher than the 35-41 base attack damage you start with.<br/><br/>Multiple Shadowrazes allows Shadow Fiend to clear creep waves very quickly.<br/><br/>Use Shadowraze in early game fights, when it deals more damage than your autoattacks.<br/>During the late game, Shadow Fiend's autoattacks should deal higher DPS than using Shadowraze.<br/><br/><br/>To land all three Shadowrazes on distant but stationary targets, move forward a little after each Shadowraze. This is particularly effective when engaging targets who are already disabled, or fighting a teammate.<br/><br/>Use Shadowraze to chase melee heroes when they are running in a straight line. Remember it also has a small area of effect.<br/><br/>Use Shadowraze to finish off enemies juking in the trees.<br/><br/>Shadowraze does hit invisible enemies, giving Shadow Fiend three chances to kill off a dying target.<br/>Use it immediately after the enemy goes invisible for increased accuracy.<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Necromastery</h4>Necromastery is usually leveled first to help Shadow Fiend start accumulating souls early, which lets him last hit more easily.<br/><br/>Necromastery receives souls from all kills, including denies. This, however, doesn't mean you should prioritize denies over last hits.<br/><br/>Jungle creeps are a safe and easy way to farm up souls with Shadowraze. This is a good way to regain souls during a tough mid lane or after a death.<br/><br/>A good way to deal with his low starting damage is to last hit Clockwerk's Power Cogs, provided he was on your team.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Presence of the Dark Lord</h4>Combined with Necromastery, Presence of the Dark Lord lets Shadow Fiend deal heavy damage with regular autoattacks.<br/><br/>Stay near enemies to keep them under the effect of the armor debuff.<br/><br/>Since armor reduction is negligible during the early game, Presence of the Dark Lord is best leveled during the late game, as Shadow Fiend has a very low basic attack damage without items or points in Necromastery.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Requiem of Souls</h4>Requiem of Souls is one of the most powerful abilities in the game, dealing up to 2160 damage after the standard 25% magic resistance deduction.<br/>At very close range, Requiem of Souls will kill almost any hero.<br/><br/><br/>Requiem of Souls has a brief charge time, meaning that positioning is extremely important to its proper use.<br/>Use the invisibility from Shadow Blade to sneak up next to an opponent before using Requiem of Souls.<br/><br/>Wait for teammates to stun, root, or slow enemies before using Requiem of Souls.<br/><br/>Begin charging Requiem of Souls next to a target that is cycloned or hidden by abilities like Astral Imprisonment, unleashing the full damage on them when the disable ends.<br/><br/>Requiem of Souls can be stopped during its channel time with the Stop command (S by default). Use this to cancel a poorly positioned cast, or to bluff and intimidate nearby enemies.<br/><br/><br/>Requiem of Souls is often skipped at level six, as it does little damage without the extra souls gained from higher levels of Necromastery, and can be hard to land without additional items like Shadow Blade or Black King Bar.<br/><br/>When retreating, use Requiem of Souls as a defensive cover for your allies and a deterrent against pursuing enemies.<br/><br/>Teamwork is very helpful when trying to land a good Requiem of Souls.<br/>Let an ally such as Earthshaker initiate teamfights before jumping in with Requiem of Souls.<br/><br/><br/>Requiem of Souls doesn't need to be cast in the middle of the enemy team to deal damage, as it can be hard to cast because you might be focused in the middle of a teamfight. So try to use it where it can hit the enemies as the slow and damage reduction debuff is powerful enough to win you the teamfight.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Tango provide the necessary health regeneration to help you staying in lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Shadow Fiend when activated at the last moment.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility compensate for your low starting damage by allowing you to last hit easier in the laning phase. The more last hits you get, the stronger you become, so this is important.<br/><br/>Clarity lets Shadow Fiend use Shadowraze more often in lane, helping him build up his Necromastery.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Stick will help supplement mana for casting Shadowraze.<br/><br/>Bottle is crucial for surviving in lane, and capturing runes.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila will give you decent early stats, but more importantly, the mana regen means you can cast Shadowraze more often.<br/><br/>Infused Raindrop will provide you with the mana regen to sustain Shadowrazes throughout the jungle, as well as provide a little bit of tankiness with the magic damage absorption.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Magic Wand will save inventory space and provide a small attribute bonus.<br/><br/>Power Treads increase your damage per second and can also be used for extra survivability.<br/><br/>Black King Bar provides good HP and damage, but more importantly, can be used to ensure Requiem of Souls is not interrupted.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade provides Shadow Fiend with an escape mechanism, and helps him position for Requiem of Souls. The invisibility fade time means you won't be visible until you're close to actually casting Requiem of Souls. Using this item and getting directly on top of an enemy and unleashing your ultimate will usually lead to a one-hit kill.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Dragon Lance gives additional attack range and stats and stacks with level 25 talent.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi grants a massive attribute bonus. In addition, its attack modifier's slow pierces spell immunity, ensuring enemies cannot kite you too easily.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass increases your team's DPS and survivability while reducing the other team's DPS and survivability. The armor reduction aura also stacks with Presence of the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>Daedalus increases damage output and scales well into the late game.<br/><br/>Satanic allows Shadow Fiend to quickly regain health during late game teamfights.<br/><br/>Desolator, in combination with a maximized Presence of the Dark Lord, reduces an attacked enemy's armor by 13, increasing the physical damage it takes even further.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is a natural upgrade from Shadow Blade, and provides a decent break mechanism.<br/><br/>Butterfly increases your DPS and makes you much more survivable against enemy carries who are reliant on their physical attacks.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade improves Shadow Fiend's physical attacks, providing a boost to agility as well as allowing his attacks to burn mana. The active can purge enemies. It is very good mid-game-oriented choice.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar increases your damage, counters enemies with evasion, and gives your physical attacks the chance to mini-bash.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is commonly picked up during the late game to push lanes and move around the map more efficiently.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly increases the damage from Requiem of Souls, and raises Necromastery's maximum soul count.<br/><br/>Manta Style is good for disjointing and confusing enemies, giving Shadow Fiend a little extra time to deal damage. It is also excellent for attacking towers and buildings.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger gives Shadow Fiend some much needed mobility, and can be used to jump into fights with Requiem of Souls.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity can be used to cyclone an enemy, giving Shadow Fiend the time to charge Requiem of Souls and hit the enemy upon landing. It is also a great counter to heroes that rely on Blink Dagger to get away since enemy heroes will take 50 damage upon landing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Slark is an extremely slipperly melee carry. Jumping over obstacles, he Pounces on enemies and jumps away to safety, shrouding himself from damage with Shadow Dance. When unseen, Slark's natural regeneration replenishes his health, allowing him to return to the fight time and time again. Slark is susceptible to area disables and magical nukes, and his damage is mostly effective against single targets.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Numerous escape mechanisms.<br/><br/>Steals enemy attributes.<br/><br/>Large night vision.<br/><br/>Strong pick-off and snowball potential.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Fragile in the early game.<br/><br/>Low attribute growth.<br/><br/>Primarily single target focused.<br/><br/>Has no stuns.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Slark is usually played in the safe lane, with a support. He can also be played in the offlane.<br/><br/>Slark is sometimes played in the mid lane, but may struggle against ranged heroes like Queen of Pain.<br/><br/>Slark's base attributes are average at best, although with enough stolen Agility and damage items he can keep up with hard carries such as Phantom Assassin and Sniper.<br/><br/>Slark is potent ganker in the mid game, and should always be looking for opportunities to pick off an enemy. The enemy jungle is an excellent hunting ground for Slark.<br/><br/>Slark's unusually large night vision radius (1800) means he can see further than most heroes at night. Use this advantage when timing ganks.<br/><br/>Because Slark lacks a stun, enemies will often blink or teleport away when ganked.<br/><br/>Slark differs from most carries in that he takes more of a hit-and-run approach.<br/><br/>Due to the high health regeneration from Shadow Dance, Slark can often return to teamfights after moving out of enemy vision to regain health.<br/><br/>Slark's mana is fairly low in the early game, when his abilities should be used sparingly.<br/><br/>Slark should try to play aggressively once he reaches level six, so he can take full advantage of the agility transfer from Essence Shift.<br/><br/>Use Slark's high mobility and pick off supports before fights break out, allowing his team to start with an advantage.<br/><br/>Slark can stack 2 or even up to 3 camps at a time using his high mobility and pounce.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Dark Pact</h4>Activate Dark Pact before using Pounce or initiating on the enemy. This gives the effect of higher burst damage, and triggers the cooldown earlier.<br/><br/>Dark Pact purges debuffs and disables from Slark, including Dust of Appearance. This is especially useful for escaping.<br/>Activate it just before you are about to be disabled by abilities like Storm Hammer or Unstable Concoction. After the projectile hits, Dark Pact will automatically remove the disable.<br/><br/><br/>The multiple hits from Dark Pact is useful against protection abilities with a limited number of charges, such as Refraction, Gravekeeper's Cloak, or Living Armor.<br/><br/>Dark Pact is a great way to finish off an invisible unit that has been leashed, as the AoE damage affects invisible targets.<br/><br/>Dark Pact is a great way to accelerate farm between gank attempts. When combined with Power Treads' ability to toggle stats, the cost of the ability can be minimized.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Pounce</h4>One point of Pounce is usually leveled first in case Slark needs to escape a bad situation.<br/><br/>When determining the direction to Pounce in, make sure Slark has fully turned towards that direction before using Pounce.<br/><br/>Use Pounce over elevations and barriers to escape pursuers.<br/><br/>Pounce will hit invisible heroes. Use it immediately after an adjacent enemy goes invisible to ensure a hit. If a leash is established, follow up with Dark pact.<br/><br/>Heroes with blinking abilities will be able to break out of Pounce's leash.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Essence Shift</h4>Maximize Essence Shift's duration by continually harassing and retreating. Go for the kill once you think you have enough damage and attack speed to take down enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Maximize Essence Shift's efficiency by taking objectives using his stolen attributes. After a large teamfight, it is not uncommon to find that Slark has stolen upwards of 50 agility, making quick work of untended towers or Roshan.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Shadow Dance</h4>In general, Shadow Dance should be activated when Slark is at low health, not at the beginning of fights.<br/>However, in some cases, Shadow Dance is best used even at high or full health to prevent targetable skills such as Tinker's Laser which could make your attacks miss, Doom's Doom, Phantom Assassin spells and many more, because once Shadow Dance is activated Slark is untargetable.<br/><br/><br/>During the laning phase, regain your health by simply retreating out of enemy vision once Slark is level six.<br/><br/>When being chased, try to get out of sight from the enemy, be it around trees, up high ground, or behind barriers. The passive from Shadow Dance will activate when out of enemy sight and give you a boost to move speed and HP regen for a short moment before sight is regained. This can be the difference between life and death.<br/><br/>Shadow Dance's passive can be used as an indirect way of detection. If you find that Slark has suddenly lose his movement speed and regeneration, it means the enemy has vision over you.<br/>This indicates that there is a source of enemy vision nearby, such as an Observer Ward, a Hawk, or an invisible enemy.<br/><br/>Keep an eye on Shadow Dance's buff icon to know whether or not the enemy has vision nearby.<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Stout Shield allows Slark to sustain more harassment from enemies and stay longer in lane. It can later be built into a Poor Man's Shield.<br/><br/>Tango help Slark regenerate his health without the need of returning to base.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Slark at the last moment.<br/><br/>Iron Branches provide good stats and can be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game</b><br/>Magic Stick can be crucial in many situations, giving a burst of mana and health when needed.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed allow Slark to catch up to enemies and immobilize them with Pounce.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield gives Slark agility points, therefore increasing his last-hitting and denying in lane. It also saves Slark from harassment in lane.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a cheap but powerful item to slow enemies and inflict damage overtime, giving an advantage to Slark's early ganks. It can later be built into an Eye of Skadi.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items</b><br/>Power Treads gives Slark attack speed and a boost to attributes that can be switched to survive teamfights or give him enough mana to use one of his abilities.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is an upgrade to Magic Stick. Giving him more stats and opens up item slots.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade provides a good source of attack speed and additional invisibility to improve your ability to gank and escape. It also synergizes very well with the passive part of Shadow Dance giving him the hp-regeneration and movement speed buffs when he is not revealed by detection.<br/><br/>Echo Sabre grants two stacks of Essence Shift right away, and its burst damage is very useful for ganking.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll can allow Slark to arrive at teamfights faster, or help him escape in a pinch. Consider holding onto one for most of the game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items</b><br/>Drum of Endurance provides Slark with attributes to improve his lackluster stat-growth while giving him extra movement speed and attack speed to help close the distance on foes. It can give him the early game advantage he needs to snowball.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha works great in conjunction with Slark's skill set allowing him to easily chase and attack enemy heroes due to the passive maim. In addition to the slow, Sange and Yasha also provides additional move speed, attack speed, and a strength and agility boost to his attributes.<br/><br/>Black King Bar's spell immunity offers protection from magic damage in team fights.It can make him almost invulnerable while under the effect of Shadow Dance.<br/><br/>Butterfly offers bonus attack speed, armor, damage, and Agility, and its evasion gives him more survivability against right-click damage. It can be activated to provide a movement speed boost that makes chasing or escaping easier.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering can be built for some stats and an aura that provides buffs such as lifesteal, mana regeneration and more to you and your teammates.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi grants Slark both incredible survivability and killing power. Its wealth of attributes provide Slark with HP, mana, armor, damage, and attack speed - all superb boosts to Slark's lackluster base attributes. Not to mention, it slows enemies on-hit and greatly helps Slark to stick to his targets.<br/><br/>Skull Basher helps lock down enemies if they break free of Pounce's leash.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is a natural extension of Shadow Blade and can improve Slark's ganking capability even further with its Break and damage reduction. Keep it in mind when facing heroes with strong passive abilities such as Phantom Assassin's Blur and Coup de Grace or Enchantress' Untouchable.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade is an extremely useful item on Slark that combines very well with Slark's high agility and attack speed, which can constantly proc bashes. It also provides him with extra attack damage and a strong active ability.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence is sometimes picked up to help Slark gank, and regenerate mana for more frequent uses for Pounce and Dark Pact.<br/><br/>Moon Shard hugely increases Slark's attack speed, allowing him to steal large amounts of attributes in a short amount of time. As the game progresses, it can be consumed to free an item slot and provide a permanent attack speed bonus.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Sniper is a very long ranged carry, designed to decimate enemies from the backline. He is able to scout ahead with his Shrapnel, and pick off targets from extreme distances with Assassinate. In the late game, a well-farmed Sniper can destroy almost any enemy before they have a chance to get close or do much in a teamfight. However, Sniper is also one of the most defenseless heroes in the game, and can be easily killed if caught alone.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high attack range.<br/><br/>High single target damage.<br/><br/>Excellent harassment abilities.<br/><br/>Easy for beginners.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No escape mechanism.<br/><br/>Low mobility.<br/><br/>Fragile and easily ganked.<br/><br/>Requires a good early game.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Stutter stepping between attack animations allows Sniper to land more hits on a moving target.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shrapnel</h4>Shrapnel is mostly a utility ability, but one should not underestimate the damage it can do in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Shrapnel gives vision. Use it as a scouting ability, such as over high ground or the Roshan Pit.<br/>Shrapnel over trees is useful for finding juking enemies.<br/><br/>Shrapnel over choke points is useful for revealing enemies before they get too close.<br/><br/>Shrapnel can reveal a distant fleeing enemy and allow Sniper to lock onto him with Assassinate.<br/><br/><br/>Use Shrapnel in front of Sniper when running away in order to slow the pursuing enemy.<br/><br/>Use Shrapnel in front of the enemy to slow them down while chasing.<br/><br/>Use Shrapnel on top of Sniper when fighting a melee ganker in order to deal as much damage as possible.<br/><br/>Use Shrapnel in combination with a teammate's AoE ability, such as Enigma's Black Hole.<br/><br/>Use Shrapnel over friendly buildings to deter enemies from attacking them.<br/><br/>Use Shrapnel over a group of fighting creeps before retreating to gain a bit of extra gold.<br/><h4>Headshot</h4>Headshot is good for harassing enemies in lane, especially against melee heroes.<br/><br/>Use the slow from Headshot to stutter step closer to the enemy.<br/><br/>When chasing an enemy with your team, landing a single Headshot may be enough to slow the target down sufficiently.<br/>This means that Sniper can stop and take a chance on a single attack if it appears that he will not be able to catch up over a long distance.<br/><br/><h4>Take Aim</h4>One level of Take Aim is typically enough for the laning phase since it allows Sniper to outrange almost all enemies.<br/><br/>If Sniper is taking heavy harassment, or playing in the dangerous solo lane, invest more points in Take Aim in order to score last hits.<br/><br/>Take Aim will also allow Sniper to harass enemy laners, but his focus should be primarily on farming.<br/><br/>With level 2 or higher, Sniper will outrange towers, allowing him to attack them without being hit.<br/><br/>With his long range, it can be tempting to instantly attack the enemy initiator in teamfights, but it is nearly always better to retrain Sniper's attacks on a carry or backline support.<br/><br/>Take Aim gives Sniper the luxury of easily switching targets in teamfights. Analyze situations with a cool head and use this to your advantage.<br/><h4>Assassinate</h4>Shrapnel gives vision through the fog of war, allowing Sniper to lock onto distant enemies with Assassinate.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Iron Branch improves Sniper's early stats, and can be built into a Magic Wand later on.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility helps with Sniper's naturally low base damage, allowing him to last hit better.<br/><br/>Faerie Fire helps Sniper score last hits.<br/><br/>Tango helps Sniper stay in lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve not only rejuvenates Sniper, using it at the last second can save also save him from a gank.<br/><br/>Infused Raindrop helps Sniper resist harassment and gankers.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is useful in emergencies, and gives Sniper some much needed survivability.<br/><br/>Wraith Band boosts Sniper's early stats, keeping him viable in his vulnerably early game stage.<br/><br/>Wind Lace is usually picked up by supports, but can be useful on Sniper to help offset his low mobility.<br/><br/>Power Treads gives Sniper the ability to switch between Strength for survivability, Agility for damage, and even Intelligence for extra mana to use a clutch Assassinate.<br/><br/>Phase Boots gives Sniper damage in exchange for attack speed, and works well with later items like Desolator or Daedalus.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Desolator greatly improves Sniper's mid game damage, and its debuff can be safely applied from long range on multiple enemies.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance increases Sniper's attack range to a maximum of 1190, allowing him to shoot down opponents before they can close the gap.<br/>Additionally, it naturally builds into Hurricane Pike, providing Sniper an additional means of escape and/or positioning.<br/><br/><br/>Mask of Madness greatly increases Sniper's attack speed, and provides a moderate boost to his movement speed. The lifesteal is good for farming, and can save Sniper in a head-to-head fight, while Silence doesn't hurt him so much. Another good choice can be Satanic for damage and survivability boost.<br/><br/>Daedalus is what gives Sniper his massive damage in the late game, and lets him tear through softer enemies in just a few shots.<br/><br/>Maelstrom is excellent against groups of enemies, or heroes with numerous summoned units like Phantom Lancer. Combined with more attack speed items, the lightning damage will trigger continuously.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Shadow Blade is often picked up by beginners, as it gives Sniper a much needed escape mechanism, as well as enabling him to position himself in team engagements. It also gives a damage boost to Sniper's first attack when cloaked.<br/><br/>Silver Edge is a decent upgrade to Shadow Blade, and can be useful on more offense oriented Snipers.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi sacrifices damage for a great boost to Sniper's survivability, as well as adding a slow debuff that helps keep enemies within Sniper's range.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is a natural progression from Maelstrom, but is sometimes skipped in favor of other direct damage boosting items. Maelstrom and Mjollnir stack with other attack modifiers like Desolator.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar grants a great increase in damage, attack speed, and is usually necessary to deal with evasion from heroes like Phantom Assassin. However, it provides no defensive boosts, and can be quite expensive.<br/><br/>Butterfly is a costly but useful item if Sniper is struggling against right-click heroes. The attack speed and damage boosts Sniper's combat capabilities a little, while the evasion and armor give him considerably more survivability against opposing carries.<br/><br/>Manta Style gives Sniper an important escape mechanism, and improves his movement speed as well as his sieging ability.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha can be an alternative to Manta Style if the player believes Sniper needs more health. It also provides 6% more movement speed and Greater Maim to help in chasing or kiting enemies.<br/><br/>Moon Shard is a luxury item that can be picked up to ensure Sniper's dominance in a winning game.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is the ultimate item, sometimes purchased out of desperation. Combined with high attack speed and/or criticals, Sniper can demolish enemies in two or three shots. This can be very risky, as Sniper dies easily and may end up giving Divine Rapier to the enemy team.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Spectre is a hard carry who can dominate the late game if she gets the necessary farm. Her Desolate ability lets her take on solo opponents with the upper hand, and Dispersion makes her a tanky foe who deals damage by reflecting incoming attacks. However, her early game is one of the worst in the game, being squishy and her only escape using up a lot of her mana pool. Get past this, however, and Spectre will be a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global map presence.<br/><br/>Extremely strong late game.<br/><br/>Can gank well early game.<br/><br/>Fairly tanky carry.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low early game health and mana.<br/><br/>Farms really slow without Radiance.<br/><br/>Item dependent.<br/><br/>Low agility gain for an agility hero.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Spectre has a terrible early game, and it's likely that enemies will try to take advantage of this. Make sure you always have enough mana for Spectral Dagger while laning so you can escape from enemies who are trying to kill you.<br/><br/>Spectre has a weak lane presence. Picking her requires a team that will largely be able to support her in the laning phase.<br/><br/>One of Spectre's biggest strengths as a carry is her ability to participate in teamfights and ganks instantly through Haunt without wasting valuable farming time.<br/><br/>Spectre's main focus should be getting Radiance, which makes her significantly more powerful, both at fighting at farming.<br/><br/>Using Manta Style to farm is a common tactic, allowing Spectre to farm areas of the map in which she would be in risk of a gank. Combined with Radiance, Spectre can be a rather effective split pusher.<br/><br/>In late game teamfights, Haunt and Desolate will allow your illusions to wither down support heroes at the back at significant speeds. In addition, you should always be in the middle of team fights to maximize the damage reflection of Dispersion.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Spectral Dagger</h4>It is generally a good idea to level up Spectral Dagger first to provide Spectre with extra mobility so that she is harder to pin down during ganks. However, be wary of its mana cost, as a single Spectral Dagger will typically consume half your mana pool per cast (in the early game).<br/><br/>Early on, always make sure you have enough mana for Spectral Dagger in case you need to make a quick escape.<br/><br/>During fights, instead of aiming at an enemy, aim it at the ground in a way that it'll hit as much enemies as possible. It'll increase the overall DPS it deals.<br/>However, aim it at fleeing enemies when the fight is ending to make sure they don't escape.<br/><br/><br/>There is a grace period after getting off the dagger where you still have free pathing. Use this to your advantage.<br/><br/>The shadow path left by Spectral Dagger lets her keep track on her prey even if the are invisible or have blinked/teleported. It also slows her target and enemies who came in to the path.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Desolate</h4>Desolate works on creeps, so it makes farming in jungle slightly faster when you can kill that last creep faster. Try to kill the weaker creeps first to maximize the damage bonus.<br/><br/>Similarly, the bonus from Desolate still works if the enemy is near neutral creeps, so engagements in the jungle won't lower your overall damage.<br/><br/>It can be used to check for invisible enemies if you melee a creep who's alone but you don't get the bonus damage. This isn't as reliable as using a Sentry Ward however.<br/><br/>Do not forget that Desolate only works on solitary enemies. Try to chase targets away from allies, causing them to take more damage.<br/><br/>Desolate damage is done before the attack, and cannot miss. While it does not serve as an alternative to Monkey King Bar, do not hesitate to engage evasive enemy heroes who are alone.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Dispersion</h4>Dispersion effectively reduces all damage you take by 22% at max level, meaning it scales really well into the late game.<br/><br/>Dispersion is classed as HP Removal, which means that it won't proc things such as Bristleback, but it also won't cancel items such as Healing Salve<br/><br/>Because the effect lessens with range, heroes with long ranges such as Drow Ranger with a Dragon Lance will take less damage from you than a melee hero would. The amount of damage you take is still fully reduced, however.<br/><br/>Synergies well with both raw HP as well as damage reduction like armor and damage block.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Haunt</h4>The illusions from Haunt carry the same things regular illusions would, which makes Radiance and Diffusal Blade even more effective on Spectre.<br/><br/>Always keep an eye on the minimap to Haunt to teamfights when needed.<br/><br/>Use Haunt to finish off fleeing enemies with low health.<br/><br/>Use Haunt to immediately return to a fight after buying back.<br/><br/>Use Haunt to assist in fights across the map while you farm in the jungle, and to even drop in if you're needed in the fight.<br/><br/>Use Haunt to quickly return to defend your base when the enemy is pushing a lane.<br/><br/>It is sometimes beneficial to leave Haunt at level 1 in the early and mid-game. Your illusions will not be strong enough to significantly benefit from an extra one or two seconds during skirmishes or team fights, and the extra points may be better spent in your other abilities.<br/><br/>Haunt can be used to escape from a bad situation if you're being ganked by 3 or 4 opponents.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Stout Shield is a good pick up to reduce the harassment you'll take, and it later builds into either Poor Man's Shield or Vanguard.<br/><br/>Tangos are good for keeping you in lane as long as possible.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Spectre at the last moment.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango gives you a little bit of HP regen and can be consumed to be able to use Spectral Dagger again while in lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Quelling Blade is a great pickup early on to help you last hit, and can later be built into Iron Talon to help in farming the jungle before Radiance.<br/><br/>Poor Man's Shield reduces the amount of harassment you take and gives you some agility to increase your base damage.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed help her escape attackers and chase down weakened enemies.<br/><br/>Ring of Regen is sometimes picked up against a hard lane.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila provides agility and bonus damage, and mana regen aura.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Radiance is a classic item on Spectre which greatly speeds up her farming, deals burn damage to all enemies during Haunt, and complements her tanky, AoE fighting style.<br/><br/>Phase Boots are efficient on Spectre in the early game, as she starts with low movement speed and damage. You should usually grab this before Radiance.<br/><br/>Manta Style lets you farm extremely fast by sending your illusions either into lane or into other jungle camps that, with Radiance, lets them take out the camps, and combines with desolate to deal a ton of damage to unwary foes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Urn of Shadows is a great early game item to take advantage of Haunt to get a lot of charges and to buff Spectre's meager strength.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade increases the damage your illusions deal, gives you some much needed mana and agility, and has a slow to keep up with enemies.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a good item to get if you desperately need the stats. It combos well with Urn of Shadows.<br/><br/>Vanguard gives a large amount of damage block, which is calculated after Dispersion. It also gives much needed early-game HP, as well as HP regeneration, which most farming heroes need to farm without breaks.<br/><br/>Blade Mail works well with Spectre's constant AoE damage and punishes enemies who try to focus you down.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives a huge amount of health and HP regen. It works well with Spectre's damage reduction, making her extremely hard to kill and reflecting that damage back on her enemies.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is a midgame snowballing item. The stats transfer well to illusions and the extra movement speed will help Spectre stick to her target.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is a good luxury item on Spectre. The stats benefit dispersion and your illusions, the slow means enemies won't be able to escape you, and the mana can help sustain the low cooldown Spectral Dagger talent.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass adds extra durability and damage and makes Haunt a global -5 armor for the duration while giving any teammates in range extra armor and attack speed.<br/><br/>Skull Basher adds some damage and HP along with immunity-piercing anticarry and chase potential that again forces attention onto her.<br/><br/>Mjollnir adds significant farming and push potential, while filling the AoE damage role of Radiance while also scaling better and having an easier buildup. Illusions can benefit from the attack speed but not the lightning effect.<br/><br/>Butterfly is a good item on any Agility carry. Spectre and her illusions can use the item to get a good mix of damage and survivability.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Templar Assassin is a highly elusive and devastating hero in the right hands. Her Refraction simultaneously protects her from any damage instance, no matter how low or high, and increases her attack damage output for a few attacks. Combined with the armor reduction of Meld, any enemy hero with small health pools should be wary of her, as if they are not vigilant, they will be crippled by her Psionic Traps, letting her catch up, or materialize herself beside them with the help of a Blink Dagger, then finish them off in only a few swings of her Psi Blades. With proper timing and the right tools, Lanaya can protect herself from powerful nukes, evade the enemy team, and even have the potential to wipe out an entire team with perfect positioning and quick actions.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Capable of shredding armor and dealing massive amounts of physical damage.<br/><br/>Can be very elusive.<br/><br/>Provides some free vision for team.<br/><br/>Can efficiently farm Ancient stacks.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very vulnerable to damage over time abilities.<br/><br/>Meld by itself is not a reliable escape mechanism.<br/><br/>Rather dependent on good positioning to make most use of Psi Blades' spill AoE.<br/><h2>Tips</h2><h3>General</h3>Templar Assassin is almost always played in the mid lane.<br/><br/>While Templar Assassin is a situational pick, when drafted properly she can spiral out of control and enter a state of near invulnerability. This allows an experienced player halt the opposing side at the start of the midgame, preventing the match from ever reaching the late game.<br/><br/>Templar Assassin requires an aggressive play style in order to be effective.<br/><br/>Templar Assassin reaches her damage peak at around level 11, earlier than most carries, through the use of Refraction and Meld.<br/><br/>Due to her early damage peak, snowballing is crucial to TA being successful. You'll want to have both your Blink Dagger and Desolator as early as possible, ideally no later than 20 minutes.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Refraction</h4>Refraction places two separate buffs onto Templar Assassin to keep track of the bonus damage and protection portion. Therefore, each buff is tracked independently and depleting one of the buffs does not affect the other.<br/><br/>Attacking allied units does not use up a Refraction charge. Use this to preserve your Refraction charges in lane for more damage.<br/><br/>Just like Meld, Refraction has an instant cast with no animation nor backswing.<br/><br/>Refraction and Meld deal physical damage and are effective against siege creeps and ancient creeps. Refraction's bonus damage also works on towers.<br/><br/>Refraction's cooldown is the same as its duration. Try to plan on entering a fight when its duration is almost finished, so you can re-cast Refraction shortly after it expires for two sets of damage block and bonus damage.<br/><br/>Refraction has a minimum damage threshold of 5, meaning that damage less than 5 is fully ignored by Refraction and is not absorbed. Because of this, enemies can still disable Blink Dagger through Refraction with the help of a damage source that deals very little damage such as Orb of Venom.<br/><br/>You can bait out powerful abilities (mostly ultimates) by casting Refraction just before the ability is cast. This does require quick reflexes, but if done right, abilities such as Finger of Death or Reaper's Scythe can be wasted and give your team a bit of breathing room.<br/><h4>Meld</h4>Meld is instant invisibility with no fade time and can be used to disjoint projectiles.<br/><br/>An early point in meld can help significantly reduce harassment from other mid heroes, such as Queen of Pain and her Shadow Strike or Tinker and his Rockets, or to disjoint the attacks from a tower that may follow you after a gank.<br/><br/>Enemies cannot remove Meld without altering Lanaya's position in some way.<br/>However, Meld is not removed by spells and abilities that forces movement in a vertical manner, such as Nyx Assassin's Impale, Sand King's Burrowstrike, Kunkka's Torrent, Lion's Earth Spike, Tidehunter's Ravage and from Cyclone-based abilities such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity and Tornado.<br/><br/>Additionally, despite X Marks the Spot shifting Layana's location, Meld is not removed by that ability.<br/><br/>Telekinesis will only remove Meld if the sub-ability is used. It will not remove Meld by itself.<br/><br/>Toss will only remove Meld if Layana is tossed towards another unit. If Layana is both the Toss object and the Toss target, it will not remove Meld since she is only being moved vertically.<br/><br/><br/>It can be difficult to hit an enemy from within Meld without a high level in Psi Blades. Use Psionic Trap, Blink Dagger, or disables from teammates to get close to enemies.<br/><br/>Meld is very useful for evading enemies when you can use it just out of sight. For example, say you are being chased towards some stairs while you are on the lower ground. Using Meld once you reach the high ground will often leave assailants confused and can sometimes lead to them continuing on in the direction you were originally headed if they assume you just blinked in that direction.<br/><br/>Maxing meld is incredibly powerful against a team with two or more heroes that can tear down refraction very fast. Such heroes (Pudge and Venomancer are common picks) have low armor and will be quickly taken care of.<br/><h4>Psi Blades</h4>Against an enemy lineup that consists of entirely ranged Heroes, you may need to max Psi Blades early in order to have any chance of last hitting and harassing efficiently while laning.<br/><br/>Psi Blades deal pure damage, not physical, meaning whatever is behind her initial target will take the same damage as the primary target. As such, try to position yourself so that you either deny and last hit at the same time or harass your foe out of the lane.<br/><br/>If you are having trouble with attacking with Meld, putting more points on Psi Blades instead of Meld early game may be a better choice. At most, a level 2 Psi Blades gives Lanaya decent enough range for her early-mid game, spending the rest of her ability points on Refraction and Meld for higher damage output.<br/><br/>The spill area of Psi Blades is positioned based on where you are when the projectile lands, not the direction the projectile came from. This can be used to score some very strange kills with a blink dagger.<br/><h4>Psionic Trap</h4>Psionic Traps can be used for vision. Place traps in narrow walkways to monitor enemy movement. Traps can also be used to maintain vision of runes and the Roshan pit.<br/><br/>Psionic Trap gains 5% more slow for every second after placement. Try to place your traps slightly ahead of enemies and let them charge past the base 30%.<br/><br/>The movement speed from Drum of Endurance, Yasha, and Phase Boots helps Lanaya chase enemies caught in her Psionic Trap.<br/><br/>You are allowed eleven Traps at max level. This allows you to permanently place traps in key spots such as rune locations and Roshan's pit for vision while having a respectable amount left over for fights.<br/><br/>Other useful places for Traps include the top of stairs, secret shops and other common chokepoints.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango give Lanaya health regeneration allowing her to stay in the lane for longer.<br/><br/>Healing Salve, used at the last moment, can save Lanaya from death.<br/><br/>Clarity help her sustain the mana cost of her Refraction, which is an essential ability for Lanaya in her laning phase.<br/><br/>Iron Branches give an overall cheap damage, health and mana boost and can be built into a Magic Wand later on.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed is a vital item for every hero in the game in order to escape and chase when necessary.<br/><br/>Bottle is important for saving runes and sustaining her health and mana while she roams the map to find kills.<br/><br/>Blight Stone is very cost-effectivce early game item and will be upgraded later to Desolator.<br/><br/>Magic Stick can help Lanaya out a lot when facing heroes which spam their abilities. The instant health and mana restore can turn around the outcome of a fight when used properly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Power Treads are a good choice of boots upgrade for Templar Assassin, as it provides a bit of everything she needs: health, damage, attack speed and mana. If an aggressive approach is desired, Phase Boots should be considered instead.<br/><br/>Magic Wand makes use of the branches and the Magic Stick from earlier and has a stronger potential heal burst.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is essential to reach Lanaya's maximum potential. Although she is technically a ranged hero, her base attack range is similar to that of a melee hero. A Blink Dagger allows her to get in range to attack enemies and land her Meld attack, or to catch up to enemies slowed by her Psionic Trap. In teamfights, it helps her to position herself to use the full potential of Psi Blades. On the other side, it is also a great escaping tool when combined with her spells. Refraction prevents the dagger from getting disabled, but if it does get disabled, Meld can help her hide for a moment and then blink out if the enemy has no True Sight or area spells.<br/><br/>Desolator increases Lanaya's damage output immensely, since Lanaya only deals physical damage by default (besides Psi Blades). The armor reduction of Desolator fully stacks with that of Meld, allowing her to reduce up to 15 armor on a target. This results in a highly increased damage output, which then translates into higher damage with Psi Blades, since their damage is based on what the initial attack target received. On top of this, Desolator also grants a decent raw attack damage bonus.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scrolls are an item every hero should carry around, especially aggressive heroes like Templar Assassin. Combined with a Blink Dagger, it can ensure a safe escape.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Black King Bar may be required to deal with disables. Although Refraction helps her from taking any kind of damage, it does not stop disables. If avoiding their disables with blink or Meld is not possible, a Black King Bar should be bought.The item also grants some raw damage and a bit of health, increasing her damage output and survivability further.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass, similar to Desolator, synergizes well with Lanaya as it reduces enemy armor and increases her attack speed, upping her damage output by a massive amount. Besides that, the additional armor compensates for her squishiness. The armor bonuses and reductions of it are also auras, making it a valuable contribution to any teamfight.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque allows Lanaya to fight for much longer, as it gives an enormous health boost. However, it should only be bought after having built up some damage first, because being tanky does not help her much when she deals little damage.<br/><br/>Butterfly is always a great item for every agility hero, as it increases attack damage and speed by a lot and also provides evasion, helping against enemy attacks. The evasion also synergizes very well with Refraction, as Refraction does not lose any of its damage block charges when Lanaya evades attacks.<br/><br/>Manta Style can be considered on Templar Assassin if some extra push power is required. If one has quick reflexes, its active can also be used to disjoint enemy attacks and spells. It also provides decent stats and grants some mobility. Keep in mind though that, despite her melee-like attack range, Templar Assassin is still a ranged hero, so the ranged illusion values and cooldown are used.<br/><br/>Daedalus is a great item on Templar Assassin, since a critical strike is spread to all enemies with Psi Blades. It also works extremely well together with her high amount of armor reduction from her ability and typical item choices. However, since it is a chance-based effect and is based on her attack damage, other damage increasing items are required first to unlock its high potential.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance gives Lanaya higher range and a good amount of stats that she needs early-mid game: Strength for health and Agility for armor and damage. The increased attack range also allows Lanaya to perhaps skip a few points on Psi Blades and focus on maxing out Meld after Refraction instead. Afterward, it may be disassembled to be turned into a Black King Bar, or kept and upgraded into Hurricane Pike, giving Lanaya a second mobility item with Blink Dagger, and its active gives Lanaya four possibly unavoidable attacks from any range.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Terrorblade is a potent carry who demolishes buildings and heroes alike with his illusions. With Metamorphosis, he transforms into an imposing demon avatar, gaining the ability to deal high damage at range. However, Terrorblade's low natural health makes him quite fragile in the early game, and his reach is rather limited without Metamorphosis.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high damage during Metamorphosis.<br/><br/>Good pusher.<br/><br/>High base armor<br/><br/>Fast farmer<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very low starting health.<br/><br/>Highly cooldown dependent<br/><br/>Low mobility.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Terrorblade is fairly item dependent, and needs to be able to farm well.<br/><br/>Terrorblade's item builds are versatile, and can range from an early/mid-game oriented build such as Ring of Aquila, Drum of Endurance, and Sange and Yasha, to a more conservative late game build such as a Linken's Sphere/ Eye of Skadi rush into Manta Style (similar to how you can itemize Medusa or Morphling).<br/>Build items this way to make his illusions stronger and to tank more magical damage since he has natural high armor to soak physical damage.<br/><br/><br/>Even though he is usually built in a more or less stable item progression, newly added items can benefit him greatly through early/mid game.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance is the best gold-to-stat ratio item currently in-game and increases his range in Metamorphosis by a considerable amount, making sieges much safer and positional options more open, as well as the items natural progression into a Hurricane Pike which increases Terrorblades mobility and adds a higher damage output or a means of escape.<br/><br/>Second best stat-to-gold ratio item is Diffusal Blade, and Terrorblade along with his illusions can really abuse the item. All of his illusions will apply the Mana Burn and the active ability Purge is his best friend against his own bane, SILENCE, whilst the slow can be pretty useful to maintain the enemy position in a place where you can bombard them from afar.<br/><br/>Echo Sabre is not to be overlooked either. Terrorblade has a relatively low mana pool and a low intelligence gain, but his naturally high agility makes him a hard hitter that likes to "man up" on heroes that rely on basic attack damage. Echo Sabre double strike ability and its applied slow significantly increase damage output, while the stats boost illusion max HP pool and offer Terrorblade a way to recover mana when out of base.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian doesn't appear as a fitting item for Terrorblade on first glance, but its insane armor increase (and Terrorblades naturally high armor), together with its active makes it a strategically useful item for a split pushing/ganking type of play. Activating Unholy Strength before summoning illusions (be it from his own ability or a Manta Style) and immediately turning it off, gives your illusions a big increase in max HP, making them viable for pushing without the creep wave. The health drain of Armlet can be abused when coupled with a " Shadow Blade/ Blink Dagger/Really good sense of positioning" to purposely drain HP and execute a Sunder gank (very effective with a Legion Commander, for example).<br/><br/>Terrorblade excels at split pushing in the mid and late game, where he can summon up to four Metamorphosed illusions with a Manta Style.<br/><br/>Sunder allows Terrorblade to dominate any one-versus-one fights with heroes that can't disable or prevent you from casting it.<br/><br/>While laning, use your illusions to stack the jungle for yourself. Then once the laning stage breaks down, you can use Metamorphosis to clear jungle stacks, thereby increasing your GPM.<br/>When appropriate, farm the jungle with the main Terrorblade while micro-ing Terrorblade illusions to farm in lane to boost your GPM.<br/><br/>To master the laning phase, make sure to use illusions as a means to draw creep aggro (keeping yourself safely behind) when your tower is under siege, effectively dragging them to a safer place to farm, while considerably lessening damage done to the tower.<br/><br/>His illusions offer a great deal of scouting potential, as they're long lasting. If summoned at appropriate locations (usually runespots, either in river or safely on your own highground), his illusions can easily creep-cut and bring the creepwave into the jungle, making split-pushing much easier and effective.<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Reflection</h4>Use Reflection to slow down a fleeing or pursuing enemy.<br/><br/>One level on Reflection is usually enough in the early game.<br/><br/>Reflections of enemy illusions can also use their passives. Casting it on heroes like Anti-Mage or Spectre can greatly cripple them.<br/><br/>Be vary of using Reflection during Metamorphosis, as its cast time is increased during the effect. Using the ability just before going into Metamorphosis creates enough confusion for you to reposition.<br/><br/>Use reflection to cancel salves and clarity. This can win the lane by denying mana or hp regen.<br/><br/>Reflection is good to harass under the enemy tower for a squishy carry trying to last hit.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Conjure Image</h4>With enough points in Conjure Image, Terrorblade can become an efficient jungler who can clear multiple camps with reasonable speed.<br/><br/>At higher levels, it is important to stack whenever your illusions aren't helping you in effective farming/zoning. This will increase your GPM by a significant amount.<br/><br/>Illusions draw creep aggro, which can be abused to draw creeps away from your tower or into jungle camps, further increasing your GPM.<br/><br/>Long lasting, the illusions can offer a means to scout out for any incoming ganks or enemy junglers, as well as a safe way to break highground.<br/><br/>They are visually distinguishable from the original, but can still look quite convincing if you micromanage them into a behavior that would appear to be the real Terrorblade (i.e. running when an enemy approaches).<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Metamorphosis</h4>Metamorphosis is what makes Terrorblade do high damage.<br/><br/>Always keep Metamorphosis off cooldown if you suspect a teamfight is about to breakout.<br/><br/>Metamorphosis has a high cooldown meaning you have to make good use of it should you choose to activate it. Avoid using it to farm camps, unless it is a stacked Ancient camp.<br/><br/>One way to be more effective is to level Metamorphosis along with Attributes Bonus. By doing this, you make Terrorblade more suitable for staying in lanes with more damage, health and mana. By the time Metamorphosis is maxed, you will have enought stats to make better illusions.<br/>You can continue on getting Bonus Attributes even in the midgame for better stats if you think that you do not need much skill points on Sunder.<br/><br/>Unless you're pushing the enemy towers, try not to activate Metamorphosis in teamfights until you have reached your attack range on the chosen target. If you ensure to only activate it when youre within range of basic attacks, you will maximize the effective damage you deal and coupled with Reflections slow you can keep the enemy within attack range long enough to eliminate them completely. This is very important in the first few usages of Metamorphosis as Terrorblade is VERY slow during it before obtaining a Yasha-based item.<br/><br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Sunder</h4>It is always better to use Sunder too early than too late.<br/><br/>While Sunder is most often used to save yourself from death or nuke an enemy carry, it can also be used to save allies. However, since Terrorblade often serves as the team's main carry, leaving yourself with very little health can be a game-risking mistake.<br/><br/>If you are below 25% HP and have no one to sunder, you can spawn an illusion and sunder it. This is mostly useful later into the game where 25% of your HP is boosted by the stats you get from items.<br/><br/>Upon filling all of your six item slots, a viable item to purchase as a "seventh slot" (usually in stash or courier) is a Refresher Orb. With a good usage it can completely turn teamfights, since Sunder and Metamorphosis are strong, but high-cooldown abilities.<br/><br/>Example: Initiators tend to start the fight and usually take the bulk of the punishment (especially late-game). If you have quick fingers, you can Sunder your HP to the initiator, which will fill him up to 100%, use Refresher Orb, and immediately Sunder an enemy of choice, leaving them vulnerable if not dead. This is especially useful once your Sunder is level 3, as it drains no mana, allowing you to use Refresher Orb without being rendered useless due to a relatively small mana pool.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve both provide needed health regeneration during the laning phase.<br/><br/>2 Slippers of Agility help Terrorblade last hit and deny easier and build into a Poor Man's Shield in the side shop.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Poor Man's Shield helps mitigate his vulnerability to harassment when in his melee state.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila provides minor stats, some armor as well as much needed mana regen.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads provide attack speed and raw stats, both of which are needed to buff up his illusions.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance greatly increases Terrorblade's range in Metamorphosis. The range also helps Terrorblade and his illusions to hit towers from a safer distance. The item can either be upgraded into hurricane pike for more mobility, or later dismantled to build bkb and yasha.<br/><br/><br/>Manta Style is a great complement to Terrorblade as it allows you to have even more illusions. A unique benefit is the fact that he can get stronger illusions and a shorter cooldown if he uses the item while in melee form, and then cast metamorphosis to get ranged illusion<br/><br/><br/>Black King Bar is vital for teamfights to prevent him from being stunned or silenced when his HP is low enough to warrant casting Sunder.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Sange and Yasha provides great all around benefits for Terrorblade and his illusions.<br/><br/>Butterfly provides the 2nd most agility of any item. Illusions also benefit from the evasion.<br/><br/>Radiance provides a lot of damage and the Radiance aura can accelerate Terrorblade's farm and increase his ability to push. Illusions carry the Radiance aura, although the aura does not stack from multiple sources.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade is a great initiation and escape item, which also allows you to get close enough to your enemy and use Sunder with minimal risk. It also provides great damage and attack speed, both good attributes in all stages of the game.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator is useful to keep Terrorblade alive in teamfights.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel can be purchased early to help Terrorblade split push.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi's gives a large amount of stats which help bulk up his illusions, and it's attack and movement slow stacks nicely with your Terrorblade, and can bring enemy heroes to a halt.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque gives you a massive health bonus, which is well needed as Terrorblade's strength growth is one of the weakest in the entire game, and a powerful regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Troll Warlord is one of the strongest hard carries in the whole game. His signature ability, Berserker's Rage, allows him to switch between melee and ranged autoattacks, both with their pros and cons. He is most devastating in a one vs. one situation because of his ability Fervor but he also can put out major damage in teamfights with Whirling Axes either slowing the enemy or making them miss. Finally, his ultimate Battle Trance gives the hero and his team increased attack speed, useful for taking objectives such as Roshan or enemy buildings.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very fast attack speed<br/><br/>One of the best 1v1 heroes in the game<br/><br/>Melee and ranged forms<br/><br/>Global, multipurposed ultimate<br/><br/>Can chainstun the enemy by bashing<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item dependent<br/><br/>No escape mechanism<br/><br/>Extremely vulnerable to disables<br/><br/>Depends on lifesteal and bashes for survivability<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>At level 25 without items and with 7 stacks of fervor and his ultimate Troll Warlord reaches 597/600 attack speed.<br/><br/>Troll Warlord is faster in melee mode, making it easier to chase or escape from enemies. It also increases your armor, so switching to melee form whenever damage is received reduces the overall damage you take.<br/><br/>You can opt for the strategy to kill Roshan early. Troll Warlord with HotD and Phase boots can easily kill Roshan thanks to his bash and high attack speed against single targets. In addition the use of a smoke may allow a sneaky Rosh.<br/><br/>When your target enemy is starting to become harder to chase in melee form, keep in mind that you still have a Ranged form. Ranged Whirling Axes can aid in crippling them, so that you can revert back to melee form to finish them off.<br/><br/>Augment Troll Warlord's power with damage-boosting items, since his power lies in his excellent attack speed.<br/>Ally buffs such as Magnus's Empower can also be a good source of boosting damage.<br/><br/><br/>Because of its scaling boost to attack speed Fervor is usually leveled up last with 1 point at level 4 for tower pushing/Roshan/beating on a single hero. Having your move speed and bash duration higher will greatly benefit your survivability and chase, since Fervor is extremely good with even only 1 skill point. But keep in mind that since a recent update the first stack is always active.<br/><br/>It's better to focus on one target rather than switching from one to another, since Fervor makes him more dangerous the more he attacks the same target with each blow.<br/><br/>Attack speed items such as Gloves of Haste and Hyperstone allow you to build up Fervor more quickly, but do not scale well if you opt to max it early on.<br/>If you're 6-slotted, sell any attack speed items for higher damage items. With all skills levelled, Troll Warlord easily achieves his maximum attack speed, so items like Mjollnir are much less useful.<br/><br/><br/>Drum of Endurance and Sange and Yasha are strong items coupled with the bonuses from Berserker's Rage, giving you even greater mobility to prevent kiting.<br/><br/>Maelstrom, Mjollnir, Orb of Venom and Eye of Skadi are the only few Unique Attack Modifiers that stack with the commonly opted Helm of the Dominator.<br/>Maelstrom is an excellent source of early-game and mid-game damage, but upgrading to a Mjollnir is discouraged as Troll Warlord hardly benefits from the 80 attack speed it provides. Instead of upgrading your Maelstrom, sell it for higher damage items such as Daedalus, or Monkey King Bar, or utility items such as Eye of Skadi, Black King Bar or Heaven's Halberd.<br/><br/><br/>Heroes who mainly auto-attack benefit greatly from Battle Trance. Try to draft at least one more hard hitting carry for your team to get the most out of it. If your team insists on picking four carries, Battle Trance can often be the saving grace for a horribly gold starved team as it equates to more than a free five second Hyperstone for everyone at its first level. Contently look at the map and use Battle Trance at any engagement of allies to give them an advantage. Check at the map at use your ultimate every time someone is fighting or pushing. Communicate with your team to know when exactly you need to activate your ultimate. Be sure to always have enough mana, buy a Ring of Basilius or an Infused Raindrop to get more mana regen.<br/>Battle Trance can be used to help allies in many ways even if you are not there, as the effects are global, that is why Troll is often played mid to reach level 6 quickly (and do a fast Roshan at the same time). Whether you have someone pushing a tower such as Nature's Prophet or Lycan, if Faceless Void has used Chronosphere, Legion Commander her Duel or if Ursa is Roshing, heroes with high base damage but low attack speed like Tiny, be sure to help your friends by using your Ultimate!<br/><br/>Battle Trance does not buff Illusions, but it does work on Meepo and his clones allowing to reach the highest DPS of the game. Because Meepo is excellent at pouncing on enemies, he can generally obliterate anyone instantly once he blink/poofs in under the effects of Battle Trance. He can use Troll's ultimate to destroy buildings in backdoor.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Berserker's Rage</h4>You should always be in melee form while moving, fighting and farming to gain bonus movement speed and the chance to bash, as well as a lower BAT. The bonus movement speed will also help you flee from an enemy, as will the +6 armor.<br/><br/>Try to finish off running heroes, zone enemy melee heroes or last-hitting creeps by changing to ranged form.<br/><br/>When toggled on, exchanges Whirling Axes (Ranged) with Whirling Axes (Melee).<br/><br/>The Bash chance is a measly 10% while in melee form. However, a bonus  20/30/40/50 Damage is done per bash, in addition to a 0.8/1.2/1.6/2 second stun.<br/><h4>Whirling Axes (Ranged)</h4>Only real purpose of this spell is to slow the opponent.<br/><br/>The melee and ranged versions of Whirling Axes have separate cooldowns. Keep this in mind when in battle, so that you can output more damage with them.<br/><br/>You should go in melee form after casting this spell to gain bonus movement speed, making chasing more efficient.<br/><br/>Slows 30% across all levels, but the duration of the slow goes up to 3/3.75/4.5/5.25 seconds. This is a deceptively powerful slow as the cooldown of the ability is 10 seconds at level 4, providing a 52.5% uptime on said slow. For comparison, Eye of Skadi provides a comparable slow, at 35%.<br/><br/>This spell only deals 75 damage across all levels.<br/><h4>Whirling Axes (Melee).</h4>This spell is your main damaging nuke, as the damage scales with level (75/125/175/225) unlike the ranged version.<br/><br/>Axes whirl in a circle around your hero, extending to a radius of 350 units before coming back, each axe having a radius of 100 units.<br/><br/>Inflicts a blind effect on enemy heroes and creeps, lasting 4/5/6/7 seconds and debuffing the afflicted with 60% miss chance.<br/><br/>You should use this spell for farming, pushing, teamfights freely. However, it does NOT affect Roshan.<br/><h4>Fervor</h4>This ability provides most of your DPS potential.<br/><br/>Try not to constantly switch targets to prevent your Fervor stacks from resetting.<br/><br/>Most effective for 1v1s, destroying buildings and Roshan.<br/><br/>Synergizes with Berserker's Rage to facilitate bashing consecutively.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve give you basic health regeneration to stay longer in lane.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection provides a minor armor bonus, it also builds into a Ring of Basilius.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Magic Stick helps against enemies that can spam spells, it later builds into Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila doubles your mana regen during the early game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots help you escape bad situations as well as closing the distance to enemies to take advantage of your more powerful melee form. As Troll has built-in attack speed, he benefits more from the raw damage of Phase Boots than the attack speed provided by Power Treads.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is core on troll because Battle Trance only lasts 5 seconds. Every second matters, and stuns and disables potentially make you unable to do anything for several seconds, wasting the spell's potential.<br/><br/>Morbid Mask provides lifesteal which works well with your high attack speed. Getting this can help you take out Roshan in the early game by yourself, especially when coupled with a critical strike, like that of Crystalys. It also upgrades into Satanic, which helps with survivability in the late game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Blink Dagger, as always, is the perfect gap closer. Most heroes are not too thrilled to get jumped on by an angry Troll.<br/><br/>Echo Sabre is an interesting pick on Troll. The double attack will help you get a lucky bash, and it will immediately give you a second stack of Fervor against whatever target you're attacking, indirectly increasing the speed of your third (and fourth and fifth...) attack. The stats it gives are also very welcome.<br/><br/>Yasha is always a decent choice, for extra movement speed and agility. Upgrade it into either a Sange and Yasha for some durability and slow, or a Manta Style for the illusions and dispel.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance is not a bad choice on Troll. Although you usually want to fight in melee form, other melee carries might punish you for trying to man-fight them (for example, an enemy Tiny with some points in Craggy Exterior), especially if they're more farmed than you). This will provide additional range to your ranged form and good stats, and it can be upgraded in a Hurricane Pike for extra mobility and kiting potential.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade offers cost effective attack speed and damage increases, strong initiation and mobility, and a mediocre escape. It also upgrades in the improved Silver Edge.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade provides good agility and helps you deplete (quickly) a target of its mana.<br/><br/>Daedalus gives your attacks a great deal of damage. Because maximum attack speed is easily achieveable with his ultimate and passive, Troll Warlord can focus on damage and get multiple Daedalus to crit more often and lifesteal even more.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar can also be picked up to counter the evasion of heroes such as Phantom Assassin, and give a big boost to your damage output. The mini bash can also help cancel spells and items that require channeling such as Town Portal Scroll.<br/><br/>Butterfly provides a massive agility and attack speed bonus as well as evasion. The attack speed part of the item makes perma bashing more likely when your ultimate is over. In addition, the evasion, combined with the blind provided by Whirling Axes provides a great deal of survivability. Finally, the Flutter ability allows you to chase or escape with ease.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ursa is a simple carry/anti-tank hero who specialises in quickly taking out enemies one at a time. He is powerful from start to finish, tearing apart enemies and getting early Roshan kills for his team with the help of his passive Fury Swipes. Combined with Overpower and Enrage, Ursa can quickly take down even the toughest heroes. However, his damage output is strictly limited to melee range and he has no mobility options, making him a prime target for enemy disables and thus heavily reliant on items such as Black King Bar and Blink Dagger.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Best solo Roshan killer in the game.<br/><br/>Very high single target damage.<br/><br/>Efficient early/mid game jungler.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dependent on Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Low mobility.<br/><br/>No disables.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Ursa's lack of ranged abilities and mobility options make him very easy to kite. Pair up with a disabler such as Lion or Shadow Shaman.<br/><br/>Ursa's Fury Swipes ability allows him to solo-kill Roshan at very low levels with any source of lifesteal (as low as level 1 if paired with Wraith King). However, doing so makes him vulnerable to ganks by a savvy enemy team. Consider informing your team to de-ward the area around the Roshan pit regularly and using Smoke of Deceit to sneak in.<br/><br/>Ursa can be easily shut down by disables.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Earthshock</h4>Earthshock is a low cooldown, decent damage AoE slow that is useful for crippling enemies while you lay waste to them with your right click attacks. Consider at least one value point in this skill early game as it gives you the full slow duration as well as a magic nuke which will more easily allow you to acquire kills.<br/><br/>Though the mana cast is not high, the low cooldown combined with Ursa's small mana pool means you will fast run out of mana if you are not careful. Consider stat items/mana regeneration items to ensure you have enough mana for this and Overpower.<br/><br/>Do not rely too much on the slow to pin down enemies; though it is very strong and lasts a good while, savvy opponents will build force staffs/glimmer capes/debuff removal items for themselves or each other, kiting you and denying you easy kills. Often it is essential to build items that give better lockdown such as Scythe of Vyse or Abyssal Blade.<br/><h4>Overpower</h4>Overpower's cooldown is shorter than its duration. This means that Ursa can cast the ability early, use up the Overpower attacks, and then cast it again immediately after for up to 12 attacks in quick succession. Use this to maximize his burst damage and jungling efficiency.<br/><br/>The combination of Overpower and Fury Swipes is the source of Ursa's tremendous damage output, as the greatly increased attack speed allows Ursa to build Fury Swipes stacks very quickly.<br/><br/>The long duration of Overpower means it should be cast before a fight to let Ursa start dealing heavy damage right away.<br/><h4>Fury Swipes</h4>Fury swipes works like troll warlords [/dota2.gamepedia.com/Troll%20Warlord Fervor]​,except that it provides damage and not attack speed.With max level for both Overpower and Fury swipes,Ursa can deal 6x plus 450 damage (x beings his base attack damage,this number can increase with enrage).<br/><br/>Works best when you already have a stack of overpower nearing its expiry time, use Earth Shock to slow down the enemy and attack.It is usually a definite kill if you do this and after that pop in another overpower stack and use enrage.<br/><h4>Enrage</h4>Because Fury Swipes' damage increases with the number of stacks, holding on to Enrage until Ursa has made several attacks on the target will result in a large increase in damage. This is especially useful for quickly wearing down Roshan's health.<br/><br/>While mainly used to amplify Ursa's damage output, the dispel and damage resistance applied by Enrage mean that he can also use it to help escape enemies.<br/><br/>Note that Enrage has a quite short duration. Enemies with long ranged or long lasting disables can therefore easily waste the Enrage buff by disabling Ursa after he has cast it. Examples of such disables are Astral Imprisonment, Nightmare, and Adaptive Strike, or even Paralyzing Cask and Malefice, which are short, but repeating stuns.<br/><br/>Enrage does not disjoint any debuff and is not recommended to be used against undisjointable debuffs such as rupture as it only puts a strong dispel on ursa<br/><br/>It is possible to put a dispel on Ursa during the duration of enrage,the dispel only activates at the starting of enrage and hence only removes existing debuffs.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items</b><br/>Tango provides health regeneration in lane..<br/><br/>Stout Shield provides damage block to counter physical harassment and can be upgraded to a Poor Man's Shield if needed. Additionally, Ursa can use it to jungle more efficiently.<br/><br/>Iron Branches can be used to make a Magic Wand and provide cheap, efficient stats for the early game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Items</b><br/>Boots of Speed are essential for most heroes but particularly Ursa as it allows him to chase down enemies to get into Earthshock range, as well as reducing down-time while jungling.<br/><br/>Magic Stick combines with earlier Iron Branches to make a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius is a useful item to keep Ursa's mana issues at bay. It can also be built into a Vladmir's Offering or Ring of Aquila, both of which are definitely viable options for Ursa.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom puts another slow in Ursa's arsenal, giving more chasing power and potentially can be used as a component of Eye of Skadi.<br/><br/>Morbid Mask naturally synergizes well with Ursa's high physical DPS, greatly increasing his staying power in the lane and in the jungle. It also gives him the option to take on Roshan.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items</b><br/>Phase Boots provide Ursa with additional chasing power, as well as damage to bolster his already high DPS.<br/><br/>Magic Wand may be useful to supplement Ursa's poor mana pool and save him from bad situations.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering or other sources of lifesteal are key to Ursa's success and his workings as a hero. Lifesteal allows him to take Roshan with ease and keep his current health high. Also lifesteal work with Fury Swipes, so Ursa can devastate any enemy by leeching a lot of health when some Fury Swipes are already placed.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is used for picking off heroes or initiating fights as it gives Ursa the option to pounce on an enemy hero with Earthshock and rapidly kill them.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is usually necessary in the late game, as Ursa is very vulnerable to disables.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scrolls are essential for any hero to be able to massively reduce downtime farming, defending towers and fighting.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items</b><br/>Shadow Blade is a potential alternative to blink dagger, providing nice bonus damage upon attacking. However, it should only be bought against teams without a Slardar or Bounty Hunter and against slow, low-mobility heroes if a Blink Dagger is likely to be cancelled by long-range spells. Also keep in mind that using Shadow Blade costs 75 mana per use, which over time adds up to a lot of lost mana.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is the best health item for slot-efficiency, providing Ursa with considerable tankiness as well as the ability to avoid retreating from a base siege for too long due to its % based regeneration.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is a great item against Disarm and Silence and other heroes possessing powerful single-target spells. It should be bought if BKB cannot stop the enemy from locking you down.<br/><br/>Blade Mail can be considered if the enemy team is focusing Ursa in fights to return the damage. It is usually bought with a Heart of Tarrasque, Satanic or Eye of Skadi on Ursa ensure he has the HP to survive the fight and deal the Blade Mail damage.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha provides some easy-to-build HP and movement speed on Ursa, so if a Blink Dagger or Shadow Blade is not viable in the game, consider this item for some added mobility and tank. It can also be disassembled to create a Heaven's Halberd and Manta Style later in the game to provide evasion and debuff removal respectively.<br/><br/>Abyssal Blade is highly useful for locking down slippery carries. The bash also synergizes with Overpower very well as you can get many procs without buying attack speed.<br/><br/>Desolator is a decent item for if your team is mostly based on physical damage. Consider buying it if you are tanky enough to not need a health item and not being kited enough to need an item that provides lockdown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Vengeful Spirit is a very strong and well-balanced support who specializes in roaming, ganking and disabling. Unlike most other casting supports, her skill set emphasizes physical damage over magical, allowing her abilities to be useful in the late game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not Item dependent<br/><br/>Abilities useful at all stages of the game<br/><br/>Has Nukes and Disables<br/><br/>High combat stat gains<br/><br/>Has very good debuffs<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can be ganked very easily<br/><br/>Limited mana pool<br/><br/>Low attack range<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Because of her combination of disables and debuffs, Vengeful Spirit is an excellent roaming partner, as she can reliably stun an enemy and reduce their armor, setting them up for being finished off by teammates. Her lack of meaningful damage output and more than one disable means that she must rely on her teammates to land follow-up stuns and kill the target, however.<br/><br/>Unlike most casting-focused supports, Vengeful Spirit benefits from an innately high strength and agility growth, giving her plenty of HP and armor. This means that, despite her sacrificial nature, she is very resilient against all types of damage, and under unusual circumstances can transition into playing as a semi-carry.<br/><br/>Vengeful Spirit is a very item-independent hero, and can greatly contribute to fights and ganks even with only a few basic items. Combined with her strong ganking prowess, she should focus on constantly roaming and engaging the enemy, singling out key targets for elimination to buy time and space for her team.<br/><br/>Due to her skill set, Vengeful Spirit benefits from building support utility items that grant her team an advantage in fights. Her ability to displace heroes with Nether Swap means that she benefits greatly from building mobility items that help her initiate, and her low base intelligence ensures that she must purchase mana items to allow her to cast her spells more regularly.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Magic Missile</h4>Magic Missile is a basic unit-targeted nuke that stuns and deals damage to the target.<br/><br/>Because it is Vengeful Spirit's only damage nuke, Magic Missile is a good spell to max out first, as magic damage is more powerful in the early game when heroes have small HP pools.<br/><br/>Beware that Magic Missile has a very high mana cost relative to Shendelzare's mana pool, and will deplete more than half of it at level 1. The target for Magic Missile must be chosen with care, as wasting the spell on a failed gank will set her back greatly.<br/><br/>Magic Missile is a reliable stun since it will home in on its target, however it also has a very short disable duration that allows its target to act earlier. This makes Magic Missile a strong initiating stun, but also means that it requires follow-up disables from allies in order to ensure a successful kill.<br/>Magic Missile is capable of piercing spell immunity if the Talent is chosen, giving it even greater utility by allowing Vengeful Spirit to truly interrupt any Heroes that happen to have both a Black King Bar and Linken's Sphere in their inventory.<br/><br/><h4>Wave of Terror</h4>Wave of Terror is a long-ranged spell that debuffs enemy armor while dealing minor nuke damage.<br/><br/>Wave of Terror is a good candidate for maxing out early in a game, since its armor reduction can soften up enemies to weaken them against physical damage. It is a strong spell at all points in the game, since physical damage becomes a stronger factor in teamfights in the late game.<br/><br/>Combined with Magic Missile, Wave of Terror is a strong set-up ability that damages and debuffs a gank target after they are stunned. The combination of stun, damage and armor reduction from both abilities will greatly weaken an enemy, making them much easier to kill by Vengeful Spirit's roaming ganking partner(s).<br/><br/>Despite its narrow width, Wave of Terror has an extremely long cast range, capable of inflicting its debuff on targets from far away. This allows Vengeful Spirit to get off the debuff very reliably, inflicting multiple enemies with armor reduction before the start of a teamfight.<br/><br/>While it deals a very small amount of damage, Wave of Terror's long cast range allows it to be used to deal player-based damage at long range. This allows the spell to be used to put an enemy Blink Dagger on cooldown, burn their Healing Salve or Clarity, and numerous other effects.<br/><br/>Wave of Terror provides vision over its travel path, allowing the spell to be used to scout enemies in the fog of war. Combined with its ability to put Blink Dagger on cooldown, Vengeful Spirit can use it to scout out hidden initiators and foul their attempts to initiate on her team. As well, the vision and damage can be used to reveal enemies inside of treelines, particularly useful for hunting down split-pushers like Tinker, Nature's Prophet and Broodmother<br/><h4>Vengeance Aura</h4>Vengeance Aura is a strong attack damage aura that boosts all nearby allies' physical damage, and inflicts a negative aura upon enemies when Vengeful Spirit is killed.<br/><br/>Because physical damage is very low in the early game, Vengeance Aura is best reserved to skill only after both Magic Missile and Wave of Terror are maxed out. The ability is not very strong in the early game, and is only truly effective once maxed out and teammates have enough attack speed to make use of the bonus damage.<br/><br/>Combined with Wave of Terror, Vengeance Aura can greatly amplify the amount of damage that allies deal with their right-clicks in ganks and teamfights.<br/><br/>Remember that when Vengeful Spirit is killed, the negative Vengeance Aura is transferred to the enemy hero who made the kill and centered on them. While it isn't possible to control who kills Vengeful Spirit, placing the debuff on their strongest physical damage carry can severely hinder their entire team.<br/><br/>Beware that the negative Vengeance Aura is only transferred upon a hero landing the killing blow. Try to avoid situations where it is possible to be killed by summons, creeps or towers, as that will prevent the aura from transferring.<br/><h4>Nether Swap</h4>Nether Swap, Vengeful Spirit's signature ability, allows her to immediately re-position herself and a target hero, enemy or ally.<br/><br/>Despite its simple mechanic, Nether Swap is an extremely flexible spell, allowing Shendel to use it for a variety of purposes. Good use of Nether Swap requires impeccable positioning on Vengeful Spirit's part, but can make or break crucial teamfights and engagements, and in the right circumstances can outright win a match.<br/><br/>The most basic use of Nether Swap is to displace an important enemy hero, immediately placing them in the middle of Vengeful Spirit's allies and effectively securing a guaranteed kill in the right circumstances. Similarly, it can be cast on an ally who has been caught by the enemy team, bringing them to immediate safety at the cost of her own life (albeit also inflicting the enemy with the negative Vengeance Aura).<br/><br/>In the early game, try to utilize the environment and architecture to your advantage, when allies alone cannot guarantee a kill. For instance, positioning Vengeful Spirit within attack range of an allied tower before swapping with an enemy will bring them inside of the tower's range, which can be followed up with by Magic Missile to increase the number of tower attacks they are forced to take.<br/><br/>Nether Swap pierces spell immunity and interrupts channeling abilities, making it a strong spell even if it is not used to explicitly gank an enemy or save a teammate. For instance, an Enigma who is channeling Black Hole can be immediately interrupted from a distance even if he has an active BKB. The same applies to Freezing Field, Death Ward, and so on. Additionally, Nether Swap can be cast to immediately break Flaming Lasso if cast from a great enough distance.<br/><br/>Beware that while Nether Swap has a very long cast range, it does not deal any damage to enemy targets, which can allow players with a Blink Dagger to simply jump away after the swap. If ganking an enemy with a Blink Dagger, try to disable it with Wave of Terror first, then target them with Magic Missile after the swap.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Nether Swap can be combined with other forced movement items and abilities. For instance, Force Staff can be used to push Shendel back to safety after swapping out an enemy, and similar results can be obtained with an allied X Marks the Spot and Test of Faith (Teleport).<br/><br/>Nether Swap can also make unreliable disables and nukes easier to land by allies, with good communication and timing. For instance, standing on top of a large Techies trap or in the path of an allied Sacred Arrow or Meat Hook can allow allies to instantly secure kills using Nether Swap.<br/><br/>Be extremely careful about Vengeful Spirit's positioning prior to casting Nether Swap, and which heroes to cast it on. Placing an enemy initiator or disabler in the middle of Vengeful Spirit's team can allow them to initiate on them with abilities like Ravage or Echo Slam. Pick your target with care, and always be sure that Shendel herself is in a position that allies are capable of exploiting prior to swapping an enemy in.<br/><br/>If being pursued by multiple heroes, Nether Swap can be used as a juking spell. By targeting it on the furthest enemy hero, Vengeful Spirit can cause the nearest pursuers to overshoot due to a sudden change in direction, giving her extra time to escape in a different direction.<br/><br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, the cooldown on Nether Swap decreases drastically, and a Vengeance Illusion spawns upon her death.<br/>Because Vengeance Aura is possessed by the Vengeance Illusion, both the negative and positive auras can be simultaneously active, the negative centered on Shendel's killer and the positive centered on her illusion. This can provide a strong teamfight advantage for as long as the illusion is alive.<br/><br/>The Vengeance Illusion spawns with all of its abilities off cooldown, meaning that it is immediately able to cast spells. Use this to get off an immediate round of spells if possible, as the enemy may attempt to focus down and destroy the illusion before it causes too much damage.<br/><br/>Be mindful that as it possesses the properties of an illusion, the Vengeance Illusion can still be instantly destroyed by the right abilities. Mana Drain, Glimpse, Hex type abilities, and so on, can immediately remove the illusion from the field, so beware of the enemy's lineup and what items they possess.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tango help Vengeful Spirit sustain during the laning phase, preventing her from returning to base due to enemy harassment.<br/><br/>Clarity is crucial for replenishing Vengeful Spirit's mana from casting Magic Missile during early ganks, as her small base mana pool means that she will run completely out after one or two casts.<br/><br/>Circlet is a cheap way to improve Vengeful Spirit's attributes, particularly her HP and mana, both of which are lacking in the early game. It can be used either to build a Ring of Aquila or Magic Wand later.<br/><br/>Animal Courier is an important item for support heroes to purchase at the start of the match. Shendel's low reliance on items makes her a good candidate for purchasing it.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is a useful pickup when in a lane against heroes who have low mana cost spells, and are harassing you with those. The burst HP and mana regen allows Vengeful Spirit to survive slightly longer and cast at least one more spell in an engagement, which can make or break a fight.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are essential early on for Vengeful Spirit, as the improved speed will allow her to escape deadly situations, as well as quickly get within range to stun them with Magic Missile<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila gives Vengeful Spirit many strong bonuses. It provides all-around attributes, particularly to her agility, and the increased armor makes her more survivable against physical damage. The Aquila Aura provides even more armor, and its flat mana regen is very helpful in the early game when Vengeful Spirit's intelligence is low. The aura can provide allies with more armor, and can be useful for pushing lanes to take map objectives after securing kills. Later on, Ring of Aquila can be disassembled to recycle its components.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a useful pick up for the same reasons as the Magic Stick. Its attribute bonuses are very useful on low-farm supports, and the increased charge storage allows Vengeful Spirit to instantly replenish a large fraction of her HP and mana, enough to stay in a fight long enough to make a greater difference.<br/><br/>Power Treads increase Vengeful Spirit's attack speed, which synergizes well with Vengeance Aura, greatly increasing her physical damage output. The ability to switch attributes allows her to either give herself more HP for survivability, more mana for casting her powerful spells, or more damage and attack speed for damage output.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage synergizes well with Wave of Terror, combining to reduce a target enemy's armor by 13 at its highest level; cast on an ally, it can help keep them alive for longer in fights. The bonuses on Vengeful Spirit herself give her increased armor for survivability against physical damage, and scaling mana regen that helps to maintain her mana pool.<br/><br/>Observer Ward are crucial for purchasing regularly as a support hero. Map vision provides intelligence about enemy movements, and is particularly useful for Vengeful Spirit given her ability to roam and get kills on lone enemies.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll are essential for cross-map transportation. Shendel's powerful abilities make her a crucial ally to have in any engagement, whether it's to save an ally who is being ganked, or to get to a gank opportunity to kill an enemy.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly reduces the cooldown on Nether Swap, allowing Vengeful Spirit to use it repeatedly in engagements, and gives her access to the Vengeance Illusion sub-ability. With a reduced cooldown, Vengeful Spirit can swap enemies repeatedly, preventing them from easily escaping so long as she is nearby, and the Vengeance Illusion spawning upon her death allows her to continue to contribute to fights even after death. The item itself also greatly improves her HP and mana, making her more resilient and improving her mana pool to reduce the strain that repeated casting of her ultimate will induce.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a cheap support item that is very useful on Vengeful Spirit. It can be used to re-position her in order to cast her abilities particularly Magic Missile and Nether Swap. It can also be used to escape from failed fights or ganks as well as save nearby allies, or push enemies into your grasp. It also improves her mana pool, allowing her to cast her spells more often in fights.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is extremely strong in the hands of Vengeful Spirit. While it cannot be used to trap enemies on unpathable terrain with Nether Swap, it greatly increases her mobility and lets her quickly get in position to stun an enemy or swap a key target. It also greatly improves her roaming potential as she can traverse over cliffs and trees while hunting for targets.<br/><br/>Desolator is a powerful semi-carry item that boosts Vengeful Spirit's damage output. Combining the attack modifier with Wave of Terror and Medallion of Courage can reduce a target's armor by up to 19, which can be enough to bring down even the tankiest heroes.<br/><br/>Butterfly is an expensive but strong luxury item for a semi-carry build. The item drastically increases Shendel's physical damage output, particularly when combined with Vengeance Aura and Wave of Terror, and provides evasion to make her harder to focus down in engagements. Its active can temporarily boost her movement speed, increasing her ability to roam the battlefield and chase down enemies.<br/><br/>Manta Style increases Vengeful Spirit's semi-carry potential further. It improves her overall attributes, particularly her agility, and improves her movement speed for better mobility. The active allows her to remove debuffs from herself while also creating illusions to confuse the enemy; as well, the illusions can carry Vengeance Aura to benefit her team even while she herself is not within range, and can even be used to provide allies with the positive aura after Shendel's death, meaning that both the positive and negative auras can be simultaneously active.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque will massively increase Vengeful Spirit's survivability, granting her a much larger HP pool and the ability to quickly regenerate between fights. This survivability gives Vengeful Spirit a much higher chance of survival when swapping herself into a group of enemy heroes, and forces them to expend more time and spells in order to bring her down.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Vengeful Spirit all-around attributes for a cheap price, and the aura provides increased movement and attack speed for both herself and nearby allies. The increased mobility, especially with the active, allows Vengeful Spirit and her team to quickly chase down enemies during ganks, or escape from pursuers.<br/><br/>Flying Courier is as essential as Animal Courier, and should be purchased at the earliest opportunity. Vengeful Spirit's low reliance on items means that she can purchase it for her team more easily than can most of her teammates.<br/><br/>Solar Crest is a strong upgrade to Medallion of Courage that further augments the bonuses it brings to the field. The increased armor shift allows Vengeful Spirit to make an even bigger dent in the enemy's armor, or provide even more protection to a target ally in combination with the bonus evasion. The additional mana regen also helps to better sustain her mana pool for casting spells.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a strong utility item on any support hero. Vengeful Spirit can use it in conjunction with Nether Swap to help ensure that an endangered ally survives, and cast on herself can improve her ganking ability as she can approach targets invisibly before disabling them with Magic Missile.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is a cheap mana item that improves Vengeful Spirit's ability to roam independently. It gives her HP and mana regen, allowing her to sustain her HP and mana more easily without going back to base. The active allows her to draw on her HP pool for immediate mana, useful for getting the mana she needs to cast Magic Missile and Nether Swap.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a useful roaming item that gives Vengeful Spirit many powerful benefits. The bonus strength and mana regen give her more HP and help to maintain her mana pool. Charges can be easily obtained through successful ganks, and the charges can be used to heal herself or allies, synergizing with Nether Swap in keeping teammates alive, or can be used to add additional Pure damage in a gank, increasing the odds of success.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are a powerful alternative option for a roaming Vengeful Spirit. The increased movement speed allows her to roam more effectively, chasing down enemies more quickly to stun them, while the armor helps her to survive more easily after a successful Nether Swap. The passive HP regen can replenish any HP lost during an engagement, allowing Vengeful Spirit to be ready for another gank shortly afterward.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots is a good support item that helps Vengeful Spirit and any roaming partners to cast their spells. Increasing the size of Shendel's mana pool reduces the strain of casting Magic Missile and Nether Swap, and the active can allow her to replenish her own mana pool and that of teammates, whether they need their spells to function in teamfights or to kill gank targets.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a utility item that increases Vengeful Spirit's teamfight presence. The aura's damage bonus stacks additively with Vengeance Aura further increasing the physical damage output of nearby teammates. Other components of aura also are very good in general.<br/><br/>Aether Lens greatly improves the utility of all of Shendel's spells. It increases the size of her meager mana pool, allowing her to cast her spells more easily, and provides HP regen for improved survivability. Boosting the cast range on all of her spells allows her to stun enemies with Magic Missile from farther away, and debuff more enemies with Wave of Terror. But most importantly, it increases the cast range of Nether Swap, allowing her to displace enemies from extremely long distances.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity can be a cheap utility item that serves multiple purposes, both in teamfights and ganks. The intelligence and mana regen bonuses will solve all of Vengeful Spirit's casting problems, and its movement speed boost allows her to position herself for casting spells or chasing down enemies more easily. The active can be used to temporarily disable secondary enemy targets while her team focuses down the primary target, or can be cast on herself to provide temporary invulnerability after a successful Nether Swap while also purging debuffs.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is a very strong semi-carry item that drastically boosts Vengeful Spirit's damage output. The increased armor will make her extremely resilient against physical damage, while the attack speed bonus allows her and nearby allies to further capitalize on Vengeance Aura's bonus damage. The enemy armor reduction can further reduce their resistance to physical damage alongside Wave of Terror.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a powerful ganking item that can help to secure guaranteed kills. While expensive, Scythe of Vyse provides an instant hard-disable that can be combined with Magic Missile to pin down gank targets reliably. The increased intelligence and mana regen also solve all of Vengeful Spirit's mana issues.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Venomancer is a support hero who can deal tremendous damage over time with his spells. He also possesses strong push and counter-push potential in his Plague Wards, allowing him to defend towers and high-ground as well as take enemy towers by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can deal tremendous amounts of damage when his spells are combined.<br/><br/>Strong slows and DOTs make him great for early ganks<br/><br/>Wards provide lots of utility like free vision, push/counterpush, and a basic ability to jungle<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No hard disables<br/><br/>Generally poor survivability<br/><br/>Has mana problems early and mid game<br/><br/>Large portions of his damage can be removed with items like Pipe of Insight or Black King Bar<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While his spells possess a large amount of raw nuking power, Venomancer lacks immediate killing power, and does not have any hard disables. Always attempt to kill enemies with the aid of teammates, as they can stun the enemy and finish them off in situations where the foe may otherwise easily escape.<br/><br/>In general, Venomancer should be played as a pushing support who provides utility to his team, rather than as a fighter, due to his general frailty and low movement speed. As such, many of the more expensive recommended luxury items that focus on physical damage output should not be built at all, as they provide little comparative benefit and do not synergize well with Venomancer's skills. Instead, focus on building mobility and utility items that help your team without requiring you to jump into the fray outside of casting your spells.<br/><br/>As an agility caster, Venomancer suffers from severe mana problems. It is recommended to focus on increasing the size of your mana pool and purchasing mana regen items when possible. Due to the high mana cost of Poison Nova, you need to carefully manage your mana so that you can cast it in a teamfight.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Venomous Gale</h4>Venomous Gale applies a strong slow on any enemies it hits, significantly reducing their movement speed.<br/><br/>Venomous Gale is one of the best ranged slows at level 1, cutting enemy movement speed in half if it successfully lands. This makes it extremely powerful with just one value point in the laning stage. If you have a tri-lane that has reliable damage output, putting Venomous Gale on a target can ensure a First Blood on the enemy's off-laner.<br/><br/>Beware that Venomous Gale costs 125 mana, and your mana pool is only 195 at level 1. As such, missing your Venomous Gale during the laning stage renders you unable to cast any other spells for some time unless you have a Clarity or other form of mana regen.<br/><br/>Be mindful that an enemy hero afflicted by Venomous Gale can be denied by their allies, preventing Venomancer and his team from profiting from their death. Try to prevent enemies from escaping if they are affected by the spell, or try to ensure that their teammates cannot arrive in time to help them.<br/><h4>Poison Sting</h4>Poison Sting applies a movement speed slow and damage over time to Venomancer's attacks. Half of the damage from this ability, as well as the full slow, is also applied to Plague Ward attacks.<br/><br/>Because it applies a slow and deals magical damage over time with each attack, Poison Sting is a good spell to max out early on. Venomancer can use his attacks to harass enemies and deal large amounts of damage without having to expend mana, and the slow stacks alongside Venomous Gale, meaning that even a single value point can greatly increase Venomancer's disable potential.<br/><br/>As both the damage and duration of the spell increase in tandem with levels, Poison Sting deals exponentially more damage as it is leveled up. Combined with Plague Wards, it is possible to place a "permanent" movement speed penalty and consistent damage over time on enemy heroes in the area.<br/><br/>Remember that the damage from Poison Sting itself is not recognized by the game as player damage, and thus enemies can still use their Blink Daggers or regen items even while under the effects of its damage. Make sure to regularly attack enemy players with your right-clicks in order to inflict player damage on them.<br/><br/>Be careful when trying to apply Poison Sting to enemy heroes with your attacks. Venomancer's attack range is quite short, so it is easy to accidentally put yourself out of position.<br/><br/>When killing creep waves or neutral camps, attack each creep once at the beginning to apply the Poison Sting debuff to all of them. This drastically increases the amount of damage you can do to them, as they all are taking damage over time right from the beginning, increasing the net amount of damage you do.<br/><br/>The idea behind leveling this ability to boost the effectiveness of your Plague Wards is that it allows them to deal the damage over time after you have left them in place and moved on. When using them in active pushes or defense, Venomancer can apply his own Poison Sting to enemy creeps, overriding that of the Plague Wards. But if he needs to go elsewhere after deploying a cluster of wards, or cannot get close to creep waves due to the risk of being initiated on by enemies, then they can benefit from Poison Sting and whittle down creep waves more effectively.<br/><h4>Plague Ward</h4>Plague Ward is Venomancer's signature ability, allowing him to place a large number of wards in a short duration that augment his firepower and provide vision.<br/><br/>Plague Wards deal weak damage in sparse numbers and at early levels, but their power becomes significant once 3 or more skill points are placed in them and they are massed in one location. If you are employing an early push strategy, it is wise to max Plague Wards first in order to put as much cheap Physical damage on the field as possible.<br/><br/>Venomancer's attack range can effectively be increased by 1000 by casting Plague Wards at their maximum range. While Venomancer's attack range is only 450, he can place Plague Wards up to 850 range away, which can attack targets up to 600 range away, boosting his striking range to 1450.<br/><br/>Plague Wards deal Piercing damage, which means that they deal increased damage against lane creeps but are less effective against towers and siege creeps. They are best used to quickly remove lane creeps from the field so that friendly creep waves can more easily reach the enemy tower.<br/>When pushing a lane, try to place your initial wave of Plague Wards just outside of the enemy tower's attack range. This way, you can safely mass them in order to make short work of the enemy's creep wave as they approach, as well as delay the creep wave at that location and give your creeps time to move forward.<br/><br/>Once your creep wave moves forward to attack the enemy's tower, only then should you place your second wave of Plague Wards within range to attack the tower. Without cover, the tower can make short work of your Plague Wards, preventing you from massing them. Try to place your ward cluster on the opposite side of the enemy tower, in the direction of the enemy's base, so that they attract the enemy creep wave's aggro and hold them in position, preventing them from attacking your creeps and defending the tower.<br/><br/><br/>Due to how frail they are and how little damage they do at level 1 and 2, it is not recommended that you cast Plague Wards too frequently during the laning stage, as they will only provide gold and experience for the enemy. As well, while they are spammable and cost small amounts of mana, placing enough to cause any meaningful amount of damage costs significantly more mana.<br/><br/>If farming jungle camps with Plague Wards, avoid placing them as the ability comes off cooldown inside the camp itself. This reduces the amount of damage that the wards can do, and can block the camp from spawning if the wards persist at the minute mark. Instead, place a cluster of wards outside of the camp and then aggro the creeps into your wards. This concentrates their firepower and reduces the amount of damage you take, and allows you to use the same ward cluster to work down two or even three neighboring camps simultaneously by pulling them into one location where the wards can attack them and automatically aggro them back with the poison damage.<br/><br/>Use Plague Wards constantly in order to provide vision of your surrounding area, especially when across the river and inside enemy territory. You can use them to scout out areas behind trees and up cliffs to ensure that enemies cannot initiate on you easily.<br/><br/>When chasing an enemy that is attempting to run away, constantly put Plague Wards ahead of them to maintain sight. This also helps in applying constant Poison Sting damage, slowing their movement speed, and potentially blocking their pathing.<br/><br/>You can place Plague Wards within juke paths to block the enemy team's movements if you are fighting in the jungle. This can be used to either stop the enemy from juking by closing off the path that they want to take, or to prevent them from pursuing you after passing through a narrow path by blocking it.<br/><br/>Remember that you can control your Plague Wards as immovable units. This can be useful if you want to change attack targets, stop a Plague Ward's auto attack or deny friendly creeps and runes, and even destroy the Aegis of the Immortal.<br/><h4>Poison Nova</h4>Poison Nova is a tremendously powerful debuff that can deal large amounts of magical damage to the enemy over time.<br/><br/>While it lacks immediate punch and does not contribute much to a fight at the start, Poison Nova can put its victims at extremely low health after a few seconds, securing kills and allowing your team mop up and take map objectives afterward.<br/><br/>Beware that Poison Nova is easily Venomancer's most expensive spell, and casting it can be very costly. Try to manage the mana that you expend from your other spells carefully, as spending too much mana may result in being unable to use your ultimate in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Even if the enemy activates spell immunity before you can cast your ultimate, keep in mind that the debuff is still applied to them, and they start taking damage immediately once their spell immunity expires. While spell immunity effectively wastes a few seconds of your ultimate, it can still deal a lot of damage to them.<br/><br/>Unless you have teammates who can follow up, do not use Poison Nova out of spite if you are about to be killed, as the cooldown is very long and it does not result in any kills unless the enemy is affected by other damage-over-time debuffs. The only exception to this is if you have Aghanim's Scepter and are level 16 or higher, as the cooldown is then reduced to below your respawn duration.<br/><br/>Remember that Poison Nova can never bring an enemy below 1 HP by itself. Therefore, you should try to apply Venomous Gale or Poison Sting to your opponents immediately before or after casting Poison Nova, as both debuffs last as long as Poison Nova itself and can help guarantee that they do not survive the Poison Nova.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve allow you to stay longer in lane without going back to the fountain.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection gives you some armor while laning, and can be upgraded to a Ring of Basilius from the side shop.<br/><br/>As a support, purchasing the Animal Courier is essential for your team.<br/><br/>Clarity is highly recommended in the laning stage, as Venomancer is highly dependent on casting spells in order to be effective. Venomancer's base mana pool and intelligence growth are quite poor, and casting Venomous Gale once at level 1 drains more than half of your mana pool.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Flying Courier should be purchased if you have enough gold to do so at the 3 minute mark. Giving your mid the ability to retrieve needed items more easily, as well as bottle crow as necessary, are essential to giving your team a major strategic advantage.<br/><br/>Magic Stick provides good regeneration, especially if you are laning against opponents who keep casting their abilities.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are important to get early on Venomancer, as his base movement speed is quite low. More mobility allows you to position yourself for your spells, particularly getting within range to cast Venomous Gale.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila solves most of your problems in the early game. It gives flat mana regeneration, which is useful due to Venomancer's low base intelligence, as well as good attributes and some armor. The mana regen allows you to place Plague Wards without running out of mana, and the armor aura can also help you push lanes more easily due to giving your lane creeps more survivability.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards are crucial on Venomancer as a support item. As he can place Plague Wards through terrain and fog of war to get vision, he can easily place Sentry Wards alongside them to de-ward enemy Observer Wards. Since Plague Wards are summoned units, he can "set and forget" them after finding an Observer Ward, rather than risk getting ganked by staying to de-ward.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand gives attributes and regeneration: it is always handy to have this item for emergencies.<br/><br/>Power Treads are a good purchase as the extra attributes can be used either to increase your intelligence to make casting easier or to increase your strength to give you more survivability. Additionally, the bonus attack speed helps you with applying Poison Sting to enemies with your attacks.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly increases the killing potential of Poison Nova: it can deal tremendous amounts of magical damage to the entire enemy team, making it perfect for initiations when assisted by teammates.<br/><br/>Observer Wards are a core requirement as a support. While you can place Plague Wards to scout enemy movement, they are limited in vision, duration and sight range, and can be far more easily spotted and destroyed.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is necessary on virtually all heroes, but is important in Venomancer's case due to his ability to show up to teamfights to cast his nukes and slows, and defend a tower and counter-push at the same time. As well, his low mobility and lack of escape abilities means that having a TP scroll on hand at all times should be the case.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Veil of Discord provides attributes and armor for Venomancer as well as the item's active, Magic Weakness, which increases the effectiveness of all of Venomancer's spells and even his passive. Though not as powerful as Aghanim's Scepter regarding Poison Nova, it is much cheaper and easier to build. Combining both can result in an astounding amount of damage over time, and also benefits teammates if you have a caster-heavy lineup.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives a lot of mana regeneration, some movement speed and intelligence, eliminating your mobility and mana issues almost entirely. It also makes positioning for casting your spells easier by disabling an opponent for a short time, and can be used to temporarily save yourself after casting Poison Nova amongst the middle of the enemy team.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is the best choice if you are your team's main initiator. Use it to position yourself before casting Poison Nova and/or Venomous Gale.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade gives more damage, more attack speed and a useful escape mechanism. You can also use its ability to initiate on the enemy team and cast your ultimate.<br/><br/>Butterfly is a very expensive item and generally not recommended when playing as a support. It drastically increases Venomancer's attack speed and damage, as well as giving him evasion and a small amount of armor, allowing him to weather physical attacks better and apply Poison Sting to multiple targets over a short amount of time.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence solves all of your mana problems and gives you more physical damage per second. Additionally, the silence can be used to disable enemies, which is useful both as a semi-carry and support.<br/><br/>Manta Style gives Venomancer more overall stats, as well as movement speed. Its active can be used to remove debuffs from yourself, and the illusions can assist in applying slows to enemy targets.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Venomancer stats across the board, and the increased movement speed can offset his low mobility somewhat. The extra attack speed also helps him apply his Poison Sting more easily.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is a highly expensive item, but can give Venomancer many strong benefits. The item grants increased HP and mana, giving Venomancer more staying power. More importantly, the cooldown reduction allows Venomancer to place Plague Wards much more frequently, and the spell lifesteal combined with his powerful damage-over-time spells, particularly Poison Nova, give him immense survivability in any fight as he can regenerate health almost as quickly as he takes damage.<br/><br/>Gem of True Sight is a stronger permanent investment but also risks surrendering the gem to the enemy if they can successfully kill Venomancer.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots are highly recommended on Venomancer, as his ultimate costs a large amount of mana and his mana pool is otherwise extremely limited. As a support, you also help your team by being able to replenish their mana as well as your own, allowing you to cast your spells more often.<br/><br/>Force Staff is useful on Venomancer if you are having trouble farming a Blink Dagger. The increased mana pool helps greatly with his ability to cast spells, and the item's active ability serves as a useful escape mechanism on a frail hero without escape abilities.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is very helpful for giving Venomancer protection against physical damage. It can be used to buy yourself some time if you are jumped on by the enemy team in a gank or teamfight, or allow you to survive long enough to cast Venomous Gale after using your ultimate.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape can be a very useful utility item. The magic resistance gives Venomancer survivability against magic nukes, while the attack speed facilitates the utility of Poison Sting. The active can be used to initiate with Poison Nova if a Blink Dagger or Force Staff is unavailable, and can be used to shield yourself or a teammate from magic nukes, or as an escape tool if the enemy has no detection.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a relatively cheap item that gives Venomancer a lot of health, a lot of intelligence to increase the size of his mana pool, and a very long range root that can help him with initiating and ganking. The active allows Venomancer to set up his Venomous Gale.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is expensive, but provides Venomancer with many strong benefits. It gives him a much larger mana pool to use, allowing him to better utilize his spells, and gives him armor for resisting physical damage. The auras add to his ability to slow enemy heroes, and the active can be used in conjunction with Poison Nova to slow enemies enough to catch them in its radius, as well as add an additional movement speed slow on top of Venomous Gale and Poison Sting.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very farm-intensive item to purchase, however, it permanently solves all of Venomancer's mana issues while also giving him an instant hard disable that he can cast on the enemy in a teamfight, even in the late game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Viper is medium carry whose potent Nethertoxin grow more potent as his target's health diminishes. His Corrosive Skin poisons any who dares attack him, while his Poison Attack and Viper Strike slows any enemy to a crawl. Because of this, Viper is an exceedingly deadly ganker during the early game, but is less potent during the late game. Viper also lacks any disables, and struggles against enemies with spell immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful slow makes him a great ganker in the early stage.<br/><br/>Fairly durable.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has mana issues during the early and mid game.<br/><br/>No real disable.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Poison Attack and Viper Strike slow attack speed as well, apply them to the enemy carry to cripple their damage output.<br/><br/>Viper is great at kiting melee carries with his large variety of slows and with an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Poison Attack</h4>Primarily leveling Poison Attack is the best way to slow and damage a target of your choice and doesn't require your opponents to attack you for the ability to be applied. If you're in a lane with supports, this is probably the strongest choice.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Nethertoxin</h4>Nethertoxin is generally the last ability to level, but if the rest of your team is capable of getting your opponents to low HP quickly, this will allow you to easily clean up fights. It's a good choice to pick up early if you want to last-hit easier.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Corrosive Skin</h4>Corrosive Skin is the best choice to max first if you'll be in situations where you and your opponent(s) will be trading blows, rather than you just attacking. The damage per level of this ability is roughly the same as Poison Attack, but greatly increases how tanky you are.<br/><br/>Corrosive Skin is especially potent against DoT spells. Between the magic resistance and continuous reapplication of Corrosive Skin to the caster of the DoT, Viper will usually take less damage than Corrosive Skin returns.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Viper Strike</h4>Viper Strike is one of the best ganking abilities in the early game. Remember to take advantage of this.<br/><br/>With an early aghanims scepter viper strike could be the best ability to start teamfights as its cooldown would be low<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Tango helps Viper stay in lane.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility adds to Viper's last hitting ability in the early game.<br/><br/>Circlet increases Viper's stats.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed is required on all heroes.<br/><br/>Wraith Band provides a decent boosts to Viper's stats.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Power Treads are the boots of choice to augment Viper's DPS and increase his tankiness.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila is common choice for any agility core hero.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance gives attack range and cheap stats, what is very important in mid-game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Hurricane Pike is a worthwhile upgrade from Dragon lance.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade is a good pickup on Viper if you intend to use it for ganking. Viper is a very capable ganker if he can get into close range with a target. Between both of his slows and his damage scaling up as his target's health decreases, Viper is a very good hero for dueling.<br/><br/>Butterfly is another item that provides a mix of damage and tankiness. Once you have a solid HP pool, evasion makes Viper much, much harder to bring down with physical damage.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade improves Viper's damage and gives mana burn. The active can purge enemies.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a strong defensive item that is useful for both yourself and your team.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar provides an unreliable disable on top of a solid chunk of damage. It's best if your team is low on disables or enemy carries are picking up evasion.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter allows Viper to cast his ult it in teamfights more than once which lowers his target's DPS, slows them, and deals a hefty amount of damage. It also increases his tankiness, and Viper's usefulness goes up greatly the longer he's in a fight.<br/><br/>Manta Style provides a mix of tankiness, damage, and chasing potential, all which greatly help Viper. It also provides a way to remove certain debuffs.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence prevents spellcasters from using disabling spells, as well as making your targets more vulnerable to your DPS. The mana regeneration also remedies Viper's constant lack of mana.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque increases Viper's tankiness, and combined with your Corrosive Skin and a Butterfly, Viper will be incredibly hard to put down.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Weaver is a slippery carry who shifts in and out of space, and turns back time to recover from his injuries. Summoning The Swarm to latch onto his enemies, Weaver can drastically reduce enemy in teamfights. Weaver is extremely item dependent, and must farm well throughout the game to be effective.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Elusive and hard to pin down.<br/><br/>Reduces enemy armor.<br/><br/>Good lane pusher.<br/><br/>Highest base damage for ranged heroes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Countered by true sight.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/><br/>Low attribute growth coupled with the lowest base stats.<br/><br/>Very item dependent.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Weaver is very item dependent, but is very hard to stop once he gets a Linken's Sphere.<br/><br/>Weaver is one of the most difficult heroes to lock down, but this elusiveness can be countered by disables, true sight, and silence.<br/><br/>Weaver is great at kiting and killing melee carries (such as Ursa) with the low cooldown of Shukuchi and the armor reduction effects of The Swarm.<br/><br/>Though treated as hard carry, Weaver is one of the most difficult heroes to lane against because of Geminate Attack granting him the ability to hit an enemy twice in a single attack instance, effectively multiplying his damage output by two every few seconds.<br/><br/>Weaver usually goes for Power Treads. The active on Phase Boots (the phase and the bonus ms) is kind of lost on Weaver since Shukuchi gives both of them already, but you can use it while Shukuchi is on cooldown. The +24 damage however is very nice, especially combined with Geminate Attack which makes it +48, a Demon Edge for half the price. Also there are plenty of times where you won't be attacking that often in a fight, making the attack speed from treads somewhat irrelevant.<br/>Alternatively, consider relying solely on Shukuchi for movement speed and skip boots entirely, focusing on more important items like Linken's Sphere and Dragon Lance for carry Weaver or Aghanim's Scepter for support Weaver.<br/><br/><br/>Weaver starts off with 15 strength for a total of 500 HP and poor armor. Don't hestitate to leave your fountain with a couple of Iron Branches or Circlets that you can upgrade into a Magic Wand or a Wraith Band. The only upside to having such a poor health pool is that flat HP regen is proportionally better on Weaver than on anyone else. An Enchanted Mango or a Ring of Regen (that will later upgrade into Drum of Endurance for example) will go a long way to keeping Weaver healthy.<br/><br/>Bottle is a very interesting choice on Weaver. Its flat HP regen does wonders on Weaver's poor health pool and the mana will help you to spam Shukuchi. You may not want to contest for runes considering how fragile you are (though you could try to swipe one under the enemy's nose with Shukuchi). Once you reach level 6, you can always use a Town Portal Scroll to regenerate in your fountain, fill your bottle, and go right back to lane with your Time Lapse.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>The Swarm</h4>Use The Swarm to soften up enemies before a teamfight.<br/><br/>Use The Swarm to latch onto enemies, keeping vision over them if they try to juke into the trees.<br/><br/>Use The Swarm before diving, so towers will target the beetles instead of you.<br/><br/>Use The Swarm to farm Ancient camps early on.<br/><br/>When attacking towers, use The Swarm on an incoming enemy creep wave. This will cause the creeps to stop and attack the beetles, giving you and your creeps more time to attack the tower.<br/><br/>The Swarm fully works on Roshan (armor reduction) and the beetle will also tank a couple of attacks for you. Weaver is actually a decent hero for level 1 Roshan attempts if your team wishes to try it (it will not be enough by itself however).<br/><h4>Shukuchi</h4>Shukuchi is your main spell and you will be using it all the time provided you have enough mana regen. It provides you, by itself, with no less than 3 means to escape or chase: it turns you invisible (potentially dodging slow projectiles such as Wraithfire Blast), it gives you 522 movement speed and you cannot be slowed, it gives you a phase movement allowing you to go through units. It also deals a bit of damage. In 95% of your games, you will want to max it first.<br/><br/>Use Shukuchi to dive and harass enemies by touching them.<br/><br/>Shukuchi allows Weaver to return to fights and deal a little extra damage, even when his health is low.<br/><br/>Since using Shukuchi doesn't interrupt channeled spells, you can use a Town Portal Scroll and then cast Shukuchi to hide while you finish the channel.<br/>This can be used when teleporting to escape or when teleporting to defend something. For example, if you cast teleport on a tower you want to defend, then Shukuchi right before the teleport channel completes, when you arrive at the tower, you will be invisible. This can cause confusion for the enemy, since they will not see you appear when the teleport completes, and may think that you cancelled the teleport.<br/><br/><br/>Attacking, using another spell or using any items will finish Shukuchi. When chasing an enemy, be sure to catch up with him as much as possible while you have 522ms before attacking him. Similarly, when you're running away, be sure to use your Magic Wand or to tread-switch when Shukuchi is over. Weaver is fragile enough with Shukuchi having a downtime of 2 seconds, don't make that downtime even longer.<br/><h4>Geminate Attack</h4>Geminate Attack is excellent for harassing a laning opponent. You can even try to push hard for a kill with it under tower if the enemy is low enough, though it should only be done if the enemy laner has no way to stun you.<br/><br/>It will not activate while denying your own creeps.<br/><br/>The second attack gets all the properties from your own right click. That means that it will lifesteal, it will crit if you have a Crystalys or similar, it has 35% chance to mini-stun and deal 160 magic damage if you have a Monkey King Bar, it can even stun if you have a Skull Basher or an Abyssal Blade (not the most recommended item on Weaver, but better on him than on most ranged heroes thanks to Geminate Attack).<br/><h4>Time Lapse</h4>Use Time Lapse after buying back to immediately return to the fight. This is a risky maneuver, however, as you most likely won't be at full HP when you arrive. Consider using this trick when you got nuked by a strong ultimate like ( Finger of Death or Laguna Blade). Using Shukuchi immediately after Time Lapse will also improve your survivability.<br/><br/>Time Lapse removes most debuffs from Weaver, which is useful for removing Dust of Appearance and many other hazardous debuffs.<br/><br/>When retreating, a confusing tactic is to run towards the enemy, then use Time Lapse to return to the original spot and escape in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>If you use Time Lapse after respawning, you should arrive next to where you died. This can serve as a poor man's tp if you died next to your tower, but it can also allow some sneaky structure damage: if you died next to an enemy tier 3 tower, and there are (allied) creeps about to push another t3 when you respawn, you can be suddenly pushing two t3s at once, and the opponent might not be expecting you to come out of the blue hitting buildings. Don't do this if there are no allied creeps as backdoor protection will kick in.<br/><br/>If you've farmed an Aghanim's Scepter, you can use Time Lapse every 12 seconds on your allies at a considerable 1000 range. If you have a hard hitting ally that wants to land a couple of auto attacks on an enemy tower, he should be able to do with ease if he knows you're ready to save him.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango gives Weaver some regeneration in lane.<br/><br/>Healing Salve can save Weaver after a dangerous situation<br/><br/>Clarity helps Weaver sustain his mana in lane.<br/><br/>Slippers of Agility helps Weaver get last hits.<br/><br/>Circlet gives Weaver a few extra stats, and be built into a Ring of Aquila to help with last hitting and mana regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick gives health and mana in a pinch, useful for playing aggressive or survivability in the laning phase.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed give a decent speed boost so Weaver can be a bit faster when he isn't in Shukuchi.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila is a cost effective stat boosting item that also helps with mana regeneration so that Shukuchi can be used more often.<br/><br/>Blight Stone synergizes well with Weaver's armor reduction.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand offers extra attributes and charge capacity.<br/><br/>Power Treads give Weaver some extra health and attack speed.<br/><br/>Desolator gives excellent damage and an armor reduction debuff that synergizes with Geminate Attack.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere gives extra health and blocks spells. Combined with Time Lapse and Shukuchi, this makes Weaver extremely hard to kill. Consider skipping it if the enemy teams have tons of low cd spells to break it such as Viscous Nasal Goo, Purifying Flames or Stifling Dagger. If they have plenty of Magic Damage, maybe go for Black King Bar instead.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Monkey King Bar grants lots of bonus damage, which Weaver makes use of with Geminate Attack.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade provides a means to remove debuffs like silence or Dust of Appearance, and slows enemies.<br/><br/>Butterfly provides damage, armor, attack speed, and evasion, making Weaver harder to kill and more damaging.<br/><br/>Daedalus greatly increases Weaver's damage, as Geminate Attack can proc the crit.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance increases Weaver's moderate range and gives decent stats (especially the 13 str that Weaver so desperately needs) at a very good price. It also upgrades into Hurricane Pike through purchase of a Force Staff and a recipe. Although force staff is an unusual choice on Weaver, the extra mobility it grants is very interesting for the 2 seconds during which Shukuchi will be on cooldown. In many scenarios, the distance you will put with force staff between you and an enemy will buy enough time for shukuchi to come off cooldown (or perhaps for a silence to expire) and for you to finally run away to safety. Finally, using the pike's active on an enemy gives you an additional way to kite him. It synergizes especially well on Weaver since you have The Swarm to keep vision on the enemy and make full usage of your four attacks with unlimited range.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque can be very frustrating for the enemy team, as Time Lapse will recover a great deal of Weaver's health.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel can be useful in the late game for pushing in lanes.<br/><br/>Satanic is a good choice on Weaver provided you didn't go for Desolator first and Eye of Skadi since is not a unique attack modifier anymore. Both will considerably increase your survivability with 25 str. The first will increase your chasing/kiting potential, and the second can give you a third life so to speak after Time Lapse with its unholy rage. Combined with Weaver's high attack and Geminate Attack, even a single attack during Satanic's active can heal you back up to full health.<br/><br/>Maelstrom and Mjollnir are rarely a terrible choice on a carry. They will help you farm faster, and you will have a chance to zap the enemies twice with a single attack through Geminate Attack. But they rarely are the best choices on Weaver.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a great item since it reduces Time Lapse's cooldown significantly, and allows it to be targeted on allies. It should be considered when Weaver is not the team's main damage dealer/carry and an extra way to save the team's carry is needed. Be mindful that a target has to be chosen when casting it instead of just pressing the hotkey.<br/><br/>Radiance gives lots of damage, which goes well with Geminate Attack. Additionally, the Radiance Burn allows Weaver to deal additional damage while invisible.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ancient Apparition is a spellcaster hero whose abilities can empower, disable and destroys with the power of ice. His ultimate, Ice Blast allows him to damage & froze his foes HP regeneration, placing them on disadvantages during every teamfight thus making him scales very well into late game. However, Kaldr is not a beginner friendly support as his skillset require precise timing and judgement to execute. He also quite fragile as he does not really possesses any reliable/instant escape and disables mechanisms.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong team fight ultimate.<br/><br/>Long range scouting spells.<br/><br/>(The only) hard counter to healing heroes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very squishy and sluggish.<br/><br/>Require good precision & judgement to make use of his skills (especially his ultimate).<br/><br/>Harassment and zoning ability is rather poor.<br/><br/>Very level dependent.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Ancient Apparition's spells, although spammable, are very mana-expensive. Be mindful of your mana consumption.<br/><br/>Any heroes that possess reliable stun/slows such as Wraith King/Lion/Shadow Demon etc. synergize very well with Kaldr's Cold Feet and Ice Vortex; results in extensive magical damage & disables duration.<br/><br/>Compare to other supports alike, Ancient Apparition was very level dependent in order to scale; thus making him a legit Hand of Midas holder.<br/><br/>Kaldr's abilities require a certain amount of skill and teamwork to make the best out of him; although primarily played as a lane support hero, a good early game allows AA to snowball and possessing a Aghanim's Scepter allows him to scale extremely well into late game.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Cold Feet</h4>At level 4, Cold Feet's cooldown is only 7 seconds while the stun lasts for 3.5 seconds and it takes 4 seconds to trigger it. It is possible to keep an enemy always under the effect of Cold Feet, either the stun or the damage.<br/><br/>The damage part is dispellable by any dispel, don't waste your mana against a hero that will shrug it off with a low-cd spell.<br/><br/>Tiny's Toss counts as distance travelled, and will therefore remove Cold Feet's debuff, even when the target is tossed straight up.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Ice Vortex</h4>Ice Vortex's cast range is huge. Use it to scout Roshan, to give vision of the high ground, to reveal common juking spots etc.<br/><br/>Ice Vortex's cooldown is only 4 seconds. In the later stages of a game, once you have enough mana, spam it.<br/><br/>If you already used Chilling Touch and you're too fragile to get near a team fight to use Cold Feet, you should at least stay behind and spam it.<br/><h4>Chilling Touch</h4>Extremely strong ability for early game team fights: can deal up to 150/240/350/480 damage per buffed ally, and up to 750/1200/1750/2400 damage with 5 buffed heroes (before reductions).<br/>It's especially strong at level 1 since the enemies will lack mobility (including Boots of Speed) to escape before it's too late.<br/><br/><br/>It doesn't work against towers, but you can remove the buff by clicking on the icon (which you can want since it does reduce your attack speed by 20).<br/><br/>Synergizes well with heroes that have built-in attack speed: Ursa, Troll Warlord, Echo Sabre to name a few.<br/><h4>Ice Blast</h4>The only ability in the game that prevents healing, making it a direct counter to a plethora of heroes.<br/><br/>There are only four abilities that can help you regain life while frostbitten: Terrorblade's Sunder, Weaver's Time Lapse, Undying's Decay and Phoenix's Supernova.<br/><br/>Heroes who rely on regenerating rapidly during teamfight such as Alchemist/Bloodseeker/Abaddon will be rendered useless under the effect of Ice Blast, thus placing them on disadvantages during the encounters. Although becoming spell immune prior getting hit by the blast can negate the impact damage however the freezing debuff pierce through immunity and cannot be dispelled.<br/><h2>Items</h2><br/>Aether Lens is a decent alternative to your standard items. Two of your spells do benefit from the extra cast range (albeit only slightly, since both have a big casting range already) and you can build it by disassembling your Arcane Boots. The spell amplification should be the main reason for you to get this item.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade upgrades nicely from a Ghost Scepter. It provides a good magical nuke, slow, and spell amp that synergizes well with your kit. The required Eaglesong however is very expensive on a more-than-often starved Apparition.<br/><br/>Octarine Core, is good on most spell-casters and Ancient Apparition is no exception. But it's extremely expensive and should never be considered before you get at least three other items.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb could theoretically prevent any kind of healing for 34 seconds with a double Ice Blast. Probably even greedier than the Octarine Core; don't think about it before you have 5 other late game items...<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Bane is a very powerful single-target disabler who possesses reasonable nuking power. His strongest suit is setting up kills for teammates with high damage output or unreliable stuns, making him a powerful roamer and ganker who can assist teammates in getting kills throughout a match. This can allow him to regularly obtain reliable gold through kills and assists, which in turn allows him to build items to suit his needs.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful single-target disabler.<br/><br/>Excellent starting stats, good at trading hits in the laning stage.<br/><br/>Excellent damage.<br/><br/>Great laning phase and ganking abilities, seeing that Nightmare can be used is many ways, be it to save or to set up combos and ganks.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Zero AoE capabilities, poor against early pushing line ups.<br/><br/>Suffers with mana problems early game.<br/><br/>Zero Mobility.<br/><br/>Ultimate requires channeling.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While he possesses strong disables, Bane suffers from a poor mana pool and no escape spells, meaning that he can run out of mana quite often while casting his high-cost low-cooldown spells, and can be easily killed if caught out of position. As such, Bane should focus on building items to increase the size of his mana pool and give himself mana regen, as well as mobility items to give him initiation and escape ability.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, all of Bane's spells are single-target, which makes him quite easy to be countered by items such as Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb. As well, his single-target nature means that he is unable to disable more than two enemies in an engagement unless additional disables can be obtained through farming items. Be sure to factor this into each game, as the enemy team's lineup as well as that of your own can vary, and as a result drastically affect Bane's effectiveness in that match.<br/><br/>Bane can be played effectively as a side lane support due to his combination of disabling and nuking power. Nightmare can be used to set up kills against lane opponents or hinder them from pursuing in the event of rotations and ganks from either side, while Enfeeble provides a safe way to harass the enemy and prevent them from getting last-hits. As well, Brain Sap can be a strong damage nuke to cast in the event of ganking targets as it deals Pure damage to the enemy while also healing Bane.<br/><br/>Bane's high base movement speed and disabling potential also allows him to be played as a roamer, especially if combined with a teammate with an unreliable but strong disable. His movement speed allows him to quickly get within range to cast Nightmare on a gank target, holding them in position for up to four seconds and making them easy targets for a follow-up disable.<br/><br/>Beware that while Bane is a strong disabler, he is also quite frail and easy to kill if focused by the enemy; as such, he is not a very strong first initiator in teamfights, but can be a strong second-wave disabler who casts his disables once the enemy's attention is not focused on him. As well, he has a very long cast animation on his spells (0.5 seconds on most spells, compared to the standard 0.3 seconds on most heroes), so it is necessary to plan ahead when casting spells.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Enfeeble</h4>Enfeeble can reduce its target's attack damage by a tremendous amount, making their physical attacks much less effective. Its extremely long cast range also allows the debuff to be placed on targets from long range and complete safety.<br/><br/>Enfeeble has a very long cast range, and its cooldown allows it to be simultaneously active on two enemies at a time, making it a powerful laning spell for preventing the enemy from farming or trading attacks. However, keep in mind Bane's small base mana pool, and be conservative with its casting as spamming the spell can render Bane unable to use his other spells if they are needed.<br/><br/>Enfeeble generally has two uses in the laning stage: preventing the enemy carry from getting last-hits and shutting down their farming, or hindering their ability to output physical damage when harassing or attempting to gank. In both cases, only one or two points in the ability are needed, as Bane should expend skill points on other important spells.<br/>Although it is generally not recommended, it's part of what makes Bane such a fearsome mid-laner. You can trade hits and deny farm very effectively with Enfeeble and spam Brain Sap to heal you back up; and you can set-up any support rotation easily with Nightmare (or while you gank the side-lanes).<br/><br/>However, Bane's damage scales pretty poorly and good opponents will quickly nullify your contribution by cancelling Nightmare and Fiend's Grip, therefore wasting most of the farm your team granted you in the middle lane.<br/><br/><br/>One very powerful aspect of Enfeeble is that it cannot be dispelled, neither by regular dispels nor strong dispels. While it can be blocked from being cast on spell immune targets, it cannot be removed once placed, which means that heroes with spell immunity will still suffer from greatly reduced attack damage. This means that placing the debuff on the enemy's strongest physical damage carry at the start of a fight will greatly hinder their damage output. As well, the debuff will remain visible on the enemy through Mirror Image-type abilities such as Manta Style and Doppelganger, making the real hero easy to identify among the illusions.<br/><h4>Brain Sap</h4>Brain Sap acts as both a heal and a nuke, allowing Bane to deal Pure damage to enemies and heal himself simultaneously.<br/><br/>Due to its high damage output, Brain Sap is the first ability that Bane should max out, as its nuking power gives Bane strong team-fight contribution. Its low cooldown also allows it to be used to maintain Bane's health pool once he has secured a source of mana regeneration.<br/><br/>While its high mana cost relative to Bane's mana pool does not allow him to spam this spell in-lane, trading HP with the enemy can allow Bane to be surprisingly resilient, which can catch the enemy off-guard. Given a source of mana regen, Bane can use the spell to harass and replenish HP, rendering the enemy's lane untenable.<br/><br/>Remember that unlike most damage nukes in the game, Brain Sap deals Pure damage rather than Magical. This can be used to your advantage to damage or even finish off enemies that have strong magic resistance, as it can cut through abilities like Berserker's Blood and Flame Guard.<br/><br/>If Bane is the target of a gank, it can be wise to reserve Brain Sap until the very end, when Bane is at very low HP, in order to lure the enemy into a false sense of security and bait them into committing to a gank. As Brain Sap creates an HP shift double what is listed (Bane is healed at the same time that the enemy is damaged), this can be used to turn the tables on enemy ganks if allies are already rushing to your aid.<br/><h4>Nightmare</h4>Nightmare is one of Bane's signature abilities, and what makes him one of the most powerful level 1 disablers in the game. With just one point in the ability, it can lock down an enemy for up to 4 seconds, rendering them helpless and giving teammates plenty of time to re-position and set up for the kill.<br/><br/>The best use of Nightmare is to hold an enemy in position and allow allies to land their unreliable stuns with ease. This is best done when combined with abilities such as Sacred Arrow, Split Earth, Torrent, and so on.<br/><br/>Remember that Nightmare does not always have to be cast on the primary target. If attempting to get kills on two enemies, casting Nightmare on a secondary target can prevent them from acting, allowing your team to focus fully on the first target without interruption.<br/><br/>Nightmare can also be used in a defensive situation. If multiple enemies are attempting to gank Bane or an ally, casting Nightmare on one of them will remove them from the fight, reducing the numbers that the enemy are able to bring to bear.<br/><br/>One of Nightmare's greatest weaknesses when used offensively is that it can be transferred via physical attacks, even by other enemies. This means that enemy players can save their team-mates by ordering an attack on an ally afflicted with Nightmare to remove the debuff from them and allow them to act; this can be repeated over time and even done at range with ranged heroes. As such, it is best to use Nightmare in situations where there are no other enemies who can interrupt it, such as when ganking the enemy's mid, or to use an additional disable on other nearby enemies.<br/><br/>In tandem to the above, make sure that when setting up for a kill, not to initiate it with a physical attack. This will not only wake up the target prematurely, but will also transfer the Nightmare to an ally, rendering them unable to act unless awoken.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Nightmare will render its target invulnerable for the first second of its duration. When cast on himself or an ally, it can allow Bane to effectively dodge projectiles and spells for one second, potentially wasting enemy spells.<br/><br/>While active on an enemy, Nightmare will eliminate any vision that they might otherwise have. This can be used to mask allied movement while setting up on a lone enemy, as they and their team-mates will have no information about your team's positions prior to the Nightmare being removed.<br/><br/>Nightmare End can allow Bane to immediately end all active instances of Nightmare. This can be useful for removing the debuff from an ally without ordering an attack on them, which requires Bane to get within attack range and take the Nightmare debuff.<br/><h4>Fiend's Grip</h4>Fiend's Grip is one of the most powerful channeled disables in the game, allowing Bane to lock down an enemy for up to 5 seconds through spell immunity.<br/><br/>Fiend's Grip is a very powerful ganking spell, as it can lock down an enemy and deal tremendous damage to them while Bane's allies also throw their damage nukes and attacks into the mix. Unlike Nightmare, the enemy can still be attacked and damaged during the disable, making it much more powerful.<br/><br/>Because it is a channeled ability, Fiend's Grip can be interrupted by disables such as stuns and silences, more-so since Bane himself is immobile for the duration of the spell and can also simply be focused down and killed by physical attacks. Be sure to position yourself prior to casting this spell such that the enemy cannot reach you, or build countermeasures to prevent disables from affecting you.<br/><br/>Remember that Fiend's Grip will drain its target's mana, not simply disable them while dealing damage. This can allow Bane to replenish a portion of his mana during the disable, enough to cast another spell at the end. As such, if you are low on mana then it can be beneficial to use Fiend's Grip first, as Bane can recover some mana during its duration, potentially enough to cast another spell that would otherwise not be possible with a different spell order.<br/><br/>Using all of Bane's spells in combination can allow him to disable and nuke down single targets, making him a very powerful ganker. He can initiate on a lone enemy using Nightmare, then re-position to set up for the kill, interrupt Nightmare by casting Fiend's Grip, then finish off the target with a Brain Sap at the end. Used to set up kills with team-mates, it can provide a 7 second setup time, then 5 seconds of hard disable during which they can attack and cast damage nukes.<br/><br/>As Fiend's Grip is a channeled spell, spells and item abilities can be cast immediately afterwards by shift-queueing them during the channel. This will allow Bane to immediately use those abilities once Fiend's Grip ends, preventing it from being ended prematurely.<br/><br/>When upgraded by Aghanim's Scepter, Fiend's Grip greatly increases in lethality and disabling potential. The increased channel time gives allies more time to kill the enemy, while the drastically increased mana drain percentage allows Bane to almost completely drain away the target's mana, leaving them virtually impotent even if they survive the channel. Additionally, inflicting Nightmare on enemies that attempt to attack Bane during the channel will paralyse even more members of the enemy team, leaving them wide open for follow-up by Bane's allies.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango allows Bane to maintain his HP pool in-lane to avoid being harassed away. As well, it can be used to destroy trees to create pathing for support functions such as chain-pulling jungle camps, revealing blocking wards, or instantly destroying enemy wards from a distance.<br/><br/>Two Clarity give Bane the ability to replenish his mediocre mana pool, allowing him to sustain casting his spells in the lane. Nightmare costs more than half of his early mana pool, so having the ability to cast it more than once in the early game allows Bane to set up ganks and kills more frequently.<br/><br/>Mantle of Intelligence increases Bane's intelligence, reducing the strain that his costly spells put on his mana pool. The increased base damage also helps him to deny allied creeps more easily and apply more harass damage to the enemy with his physical attacks.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should be purchased on Bane, as his laning phase does not rely heavily on needing items to be effective.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed is crucial to get on Bane, as he must get within range of enemies to cast Nightmare on them. As well, the increased movement speed allows him to escape ganks by the enemy more easily.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is crucial to get on Bane in order to give him burst HP and mana regen. This can tremendously increase his effectiveness as a fully-charged Magic Stick can give him enough mana to cast his high-impact spells in a fight if he runs out.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is extremely important to get early on Bane in order to give him the mana to cast his spells more often, offsetting his abysmal intelligence growth. Its HP cost can be offset by casting Brain Sap.<br/><br/>Null Talisman can be upgraded from a Mantle of Intelligence for a relatively cheap price. It gives Bane useful stats, particularly to his intelligence, giving him more mana and attack damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots increases the size of Bane's mana pool and gives him some additional movement speed, allowing him to cast spells more often and get into position for casting those spells more easily. As he otherwise has problems casting spells on his small mana pool, Arcane Boots can allow him to be more effective in any engagement. It also allows him to replenish his mana and that of his allies, important for supports.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is expensive but can be a very powerful tool in Bane's hands. By increasing the damage and duration of Fiend's Grip, he can increase the odds of getting kills during ganks. As well, it can immediately counter attempts to focus him down with physical attacks, as he can inflict Nightmare on enemies that try to attack him, increasing the odds of channeling his ultimate to its maximum duration.<br/><br/>Observer Ward are important to regularly purchase on support heroes. Aside from providing rune vision in the laning stage, it provides intelligence on the enemy team's movements and helps spot potential gank targets.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is crucial to always carry on high-impact supports. By being able to re-position around the map, Bane can save allies from ganks by disabling the opponent and even turn them completely around, or can position to gank an important enemy hero when the opportunity presents itself.<br/><br/>Force Staff provides Bane with many useful bonuses. Its easy and cheap buildup makes it easy to obtain even as a support, and the item provides more intelligence and HP regen, giving Bane a larger mana pool and some HP sustain. The active can be used to re-position Bane for casting his spells or escaping, on allies to help them escape pursuing enemies, or on enemies with Linken's Sphere to break it prior to casting a disable.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Necronomicon can be used in conjunction with Fiend's Grip, as the summons can be used to attack the gripped target. In addition, it provides Bane with increased survivability through bonus strength and a bigger mana pool through bonus intelligence.<br/><br/>Black King Bar protects against most stuns and disables. When casting Fiend's Grip with Black King Bar active, the only way for the enemy team to interrupt it is either with spell immunity-piercing disables or to attempt to focus Bane down with physical attacks.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is extremely powerful in Bane's hands and should be built in the late game if possible. The item provides a large intelligence bonus and scaling mana regen that alleviates Bane's casting problems, while also providing all-around stats to increase survivability. The active adds yet another disable to Bane's arsenal, giving him a ranged instant hard disable to use.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard provides Bane with armor, increasing his resistance to physical damage. The added intelligence improves his damage and expands his mana pool, and the active slow can be used to add more damage in teamfights or to slow fleeing enemies to catch up to them for casting disables.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos gives Bane more HP and a larger mana pool, both useful on casting-focused low-HP supports. The active lets Bane drastically slow enemies from an extremely long range, allowing him to quickly get within range to cast a harder disable.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is an expensive investment, but it gives Bane increased positioning and ganking capability. The increased movement speed allows Bane to get within range for casting his disables on targets, while the ability to teleport allows<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter gives Bane a way to shield himself from physical damage for a short duration, giving him time to cast his disables if the enemy attempts to focus him down. It can also be used while channeling Fiend's Grip to prevent the enemy from killing him with physical attacks.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is extremely powerful, and should be considered a core item for Bane. It drastically increases his initiation power by allowing him to instantly get within range to cast his disables, crucial for getting ganks off or disabling the right targets in teamfights.<br/><br/>Flying Courier should be purchased as early as possible as a support, in order to ferry items to teammates faster. This is particularly important for your mid player, who may need to use it for Bottle crowing.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a cheap utility item that increases Bane's overall effectiveness. It can be cast on allies to save them from enemy initiations, it can be cast on Bane himself to allow him to invisibly initiate on an enemy with his disables, or it can be used while channeling Fiend's Grip to cloak him from enemy vision, preventing them from hitting him with targeted disables.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards are important to purchase regularly on supports, especially ranged heroes that can de-ward elevated ward spots.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango is a useful laning item, as it provides Bane with a small amount of passive HP regeneration, allowing him to mitigate harass damage. More importantly, it gives him burst mana regen in the early game, allowing him to get off one more spell if he runs out of mana at an inopportune moment.<br/><br/>Bottle can be a useful roaming pickup for replenishing Bane's mana, allowing him to cast his spells more frequently. A full Bottle can restore up to 210 mana (more if attribute switching is employed), giving Bane more mana to use.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots is best reserved for playing the roaming hard support role where gold is harder to come by. While Bane will be more mana-starved without Arcane Boots, the increased armor and HP regen helps give him more survivability, while the higher movement speed lets him roam and position for spells better. The passive HP regen also helps to offset Soul Ring's HP cost, increasing Bane's independent roaming potential.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows gives Bane more utility while also providing useful bonuses. As he is already a strong ganker, Bane can easily get charges that can then be used to heal teammates or add additional damage to ganks. The item also provides bonus strength, giving Bane more HP, and some mana regen for casting purposes.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a strong utility item that gives Bane more setup power. Casting the active on a gank target will weaken their armor, allowing allies to deal more physical damage to them, and the passive mana regen helps Bane to maintain his mana pool. As well, it can be used to help take Roshan more easily.<br/><br/>Aether Lens greatly increases Bane's overall effectiveness, as all of his spells are single-target. It can be easily completed from disassembling Arcane Boots, and provides a boost to HP regen, allowing Bane to roam more effectively due to the reduced need to return to base. Increasing the cast range of all of Bane's spells allows him to disable enemies from much longer ranges with Nightmare, inflict enemy carries with Enfeeble well before they enter combat range, and channel Fiend's Grip from behind allies so that it cannot be easily interrupted.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is very powerful on Bane should he be able to build it up. The increased movement speed allows Bane to position for spells or chase enemies more easily, and the intelligence and strong scaling mana regen greatly help with his casting. The active provides yet another disable that Bane can use on the enemy to set up ganks or hinder them in teamfights, or can be cast on Bane himself to provide a short duration of invulnerability while also dispelling debuffs such as silences.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Batrider is a Intelligence hero great at ganking, most focused on disrupting the enemy team's positioning and isolating enemies. His Flaming Lasso can be used to single out certain heroes, along with using his Sticky Napalm to increase the damage his enemies take. His Firefly allows him to move over terrain, opening numerous possibilities for him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the best slows in-game<br/><br/>Good ganker<br/><br/>Strong early game presence<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low Attack Range<br/><br/>Low Movement Speed<br/><br/>Item Dependency<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Batrider can effectively jungle early with a few points put into Firefly and Sticky Napalm. Make sure to stack the camps to maximize income!<br/><br/>Make sure you have a Blink Dagger and a Smoke of Deceit when you gank with Flaming Lasso. Most enemies will not know what hit them.<br/><br/>Remember that Batrider has only 1200 day vision while most other heroes have 1800, keep this in mind when ganking.<br/><br/>During the mid-game, remember to go for ganks with smoke, often times only one other hero is needed to secure kills.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Sticky Napalm</h4>Batrider can dominate the middle lane thanks to Sticky Napalm, and even be able to go for kills with Firefly and a few stacks of napalm on the enemy midlaner.<br/><br/>Always keep in mind that Sticky Napalm provides vision for 2 seconds on its location. Combined with the free-pathing from Firefly, it should be impossible to juke you.<br/><br/>Firefly's damage is dealt twice per second, so the bonus damage from sticky napalm will also be counted twice. Therefore, one single stack of napalm will increase Firefly's DPS on heroes by 20/30/40/50.<br/>Against heroes, an extra point in Napalm will be as valuable as an extra point in Firefly once you've reached two stacks of Napalm on that hero. If you're having troubles getting more than one or two on an opponent, you're better off with extra points in Firefly since it will also increase the damage of everything that's not covered in Napalm. However, if you can isolate a target, the DPS increase from Napalm will be better than the on from Firefly once you reach three stacks.<br/><br/><h4>Flamebreak</h4>It has an insane 1500 cast range. If you've managed to get away from a team fight with a sliver of HP, you can still probably turn around and throw your molotov from a safe distance before going back to your fountain.<br/><br/>Be wary however that the knock-back from Flamebreak can push an opponent at a safe distance from your ally.... Just as easily as it can shove him back into your ally's grip...<br/><br/>Flamebreak does not cancel any channeled abilities, so the previous point becomes especially important when someone is trying to cancel a Town Portal Scroll for example.<br/><br/>Does 4/5/6/7 instances of damage. As a purely hypothetical scenario, with 10 stacks of level 4 Napalm, it could deal up to 4/5/6/7*(25/30/35/40 + 10*25) = 1,100/1,400/1,710/2,030 magic damage before any reduction or amplification.<br/><h4>Firefly</h4>Use Firefly to approach enemies from angles they would not expect you, or to hide in the trees and wait for an opportunity to arise.<br/><br/>Batrider can also be a viable solo offlaner thanks to flying movement Firefly gives, allowing for a somewhat reliable escape from bad situations.<br/><br/>Does a total of 37 ticks of damage. As a purely hypothetical scenario, with 10 stacks of level 4 Napalm, it could deal up to 37*(35 + 10*25) = 10,545 magic damage before any reduction or amplification.<br/><br/>When you're jungling, extra points in Sticky Napalm are more valuable than extra points in Firefly. Even with its damage reduced against creeps, Napalm scales better once you've reached 4-5 stacks.<br/>As an example, let's assume you are level 3. You can either have 2 points in Firefly in which case you can deal 37*(15 + 10*2.5) = 1480 damage; or two points in Napalm in which case you can deal 37*(5 + 10*5) = 2035 damage. Overall, that extra point in Napalm is as valuable as the extra point in Firefly once you've reached 4 stacks (since 4*2.5 = 10 which equals Firelfy's DPS increase), and it becomes more valuable once you have 5 stacks. This is true at all levels of Firefly and Napalm since they both scale linearly.<br/><br/><h4>Flaming Lasso</h4>Batrider should center around movement speed and positioning items to get the most out of his ultimate.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter can be bought as a way of initiating on 2 clumped up targets, this can be devastating late game as it means batrider can effectively pull two targets out of position.<br/>This item also causes Flaming Lasso to deal 100 damage per second, adding more total damage due to its longer duration at higher ranks.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tangoes gives needed health regeneration during the laning phase.<br/><br/>Iron Branch gives cheap health, mana, and damage and can later be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Urn of Shadows gives more killing power and sustainability.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Tranquil Boots is mandatory for an offlane batrider, providing a source of HP regen to allow him to remain on lane.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is essential for Batrider as both Firefly and Flaming Lasso require deliberate positioning to be effective.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots can be a good pickup for Batrider because he is mana dependent early game.<br/><br/>Force Staff can be used while lassoing a target, allowing you to drag them even further.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a great pickup for Batrider. It gives you movement speed to improve Lasso effect, mana regen to help spam your abilities and also another disable to help in teamfights or to disjoint projectiles.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel gives unmatched global presence and the extra movement speed allows Batrider to drag enemies farther during his ultimate.<br/><br/>Black King Bar prevents Batrider from being stopped by most stuns meaning he can drag the target further out of position without dying as quickly himself.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter seems pretty expensive on Batrider, but it can prove itself seriously efficiency. Because, it allows him to catch two heroes instead of one, and if it haves Refresher Orb, it can catch two more, which means he can become a real threat to grouped heroes on low HP.<br/><br/>Octarine Core can be bought in late game as a luxury item, which will give you a much higher health and mana pool supplying health and mana regen, magic lifesteal which will fit with Firefly and Flamebreak and also will reduce your cooldowns allowing for an even better spam of all skills.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard has an interesting active that fits nicely in your initiator role. The slow it does can prevent your enemies from reacting on your initiation, the damage it deals can put their Blink Daggers on cooldown. The +15 armor and +30 intelligence is always nice to have...<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Chen is a support who is one of the strongest junglers in the game, and can use his persuaded creeps (thanks to Holy Persuasion) to gank and push very early in a game. Chen is able to weaken his adversaries with his Penitence, and can heal all allies and neutral creeps under his control with Hand of God. His reliance on micromanagement and map awareness makes him a difficult hero to master, but utilized properly Chen has the ability to gain a powerful early advantage for his team, which can allow them to decisively end matches quickly.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Natural jungler.<br/><br/>Global Heal.<br/><br/>Most effective pusher in early stage of the game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very micro-intensive<br/><br/>Very hard to play<br/><br/>If not played properly will make enemies gain significant gold advantages.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While Chen is a force to be reckoned with in the early game, he loses much of his potency in the late game. Because Chen depends on the strength of his creeps to overpower enemy heroes and push down towers in the early game, his greatest weakness is to allow the enemy to get enough farm and levels to easily deal with his creeps, rendering them useless. As such, Chen must attempt to gain a powerful early lead for his team, and try to crush the enemy before they become strong enough to simply farm his creeps and turn them into a liability.<br/><br/>Chen is usually played as a jungler, as Holy Persuasion allows him to convert a neutral creep to do his bidding. The creep can be used to farm other neutral camps, using its auto-attacks and abilities to kill other neutrals while tanking their attacks to keep Chen safe. As well, the neutral creep can use its active ability to assist Chen in ganking the enemy, on top of adding its attacks to deal more damage to the gank target.<br/><br/>Using Holy Persuasion on an enemy creep in conjunction with the teleport part of Test of Faith it is possible to send an enemy hero teleporting to that creep into your fountain.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Penitence</h4>Penitence applies a debuff to the target enemy unit, slowing them while inflicting them with damage amplification.<br/><br/>Depending on team composition, Penitence can be a strong debuff to cast on an enemy during a gank. It can stack alongside other slows, preventing the target from easily escaping, while also increasing the amount of damage the target takes from allied attacks and nukes.<br/><br/>An early level of Penitence can help increase the odds of a successful kill when Chen rotates to gank enemies with the help of his creeps, as it as a very long cast range and the slow and damage amplification can make a big difference. However, keep in mind that since it is a percentage-based debuff, it is not as effective in the early game. Early skill points should be put into Test of Faith and Holy Persuasion in order to allow Chen to do more in the early game.<br/><br/>In teamfights, try to cast Penitence on high-priority enemies, since the slow can hinder their positioning and the damage amplification can help make them easier to focus down by your teammates. At max level the spell has a 72% up time, allowing it to greatly hinder enemies at all times during prolonged engagements.<br/><br/>While the slow is not very strong compared to those possessed by other heroes, Penitence can be cast as a slow debuff to aid escaping teammates. The spell's long cast range allows it to be used from relative safety, and can hinder enemies that are trying to pursue a weakened teammate.<br/><h4>Test of Faith</h4>Test of Faith is a random-damage nuke that allows Chen to deal Pure damage to enemies.<br/><br/>While it is generally not reliable, Test of Faith should be Chen's second-priority spell to max out after Holy Persuasion. Being able to contribute an additional damage nuke during a gank can make a big difference, and the spell's level also affects the effectiveness of the teleport sub-ability.<br/><br/>Remember that Test of Faith is a Pure damage nuke, and thus interacts differently from most other damage nukes. While it cannot take advantage of magic resistance debuffs such as Ancient Seal or Natural Order, it also ignores enemy magic shields and any abilities that provide them with bonus magic resistance, making it strong against abilities like Spell Shield, Berserker's Blood and Flame Guard.<br/><br/>Test of Faith is best used in conjunction alongside Penitence, as Penitence will amplify the power of all damage types, including Pure. As well, beware Test of Faith's long cooldown, which prevents it from being used more than once or twice in a gank or teamfight.<br/><h4>Test of Faith</h4>Test of Faith (Teleport)} allows Chen to send an allied unit back to his team's fountain, with a delay when sending a hero back. It also allows Chen to summon all converted creeps to his side after the same delay.<br/><br/>Test of Faith's teleport is mainly used to save teammates that are in danger of being killed by the enemy. If an ally's life is threatened, immediately casting Test of Faith on them can increase their chances of surviving, only requiring them to evade the enemy for a few more seconds.<br/><br/>Using Test of Faith to send Chen's creeps back to his team's fountain has many uses. Saving a creep and sending it back to base can allow Chen to continue to use it, as certain creeps can be hard to find in the jungle. As well, returning a creep to base can be a useful way to re-position it, as it can then walk to its destination more safely and possibly faster than if it began its journey from Chen's location.<br/><br/>Beware Test of Faith's heavy mana cost. Because Chen is so reliant on casting spells in order to be effective, it can be hard to ensure that Chen has enough mana to cast all of his abilities, particularly his ultimate.<br/><br/>When cast on himself, Test of Faith allows Chen to summon his congregation to his current position after a short delay. This can be important for gathering his creeps to prepare for a gank or push, or to prevent the enemy from farming them for gold and experience.<br/><h4>Holy Persuasion</h4>Holy Persuasion is Chen's signature ability, allowing him to convert non-friendly creeps, whether they are enemy or neutral, to fight by his side. It also increases the converted unit's maximum HP if it is below the spell's threshold.<br/><br/>Taken at level 1, Holy Persuasion is what allows Chen to be one of the strongest junglers in the game. Given a source of mana replenishment, Chen can farm safely and reliably in order to get levels and gold to become effective. It is the best spell to max out first as Chen, as each additional level allows Chen to control more creeps simultaneously and increases the survivability of weaker creeps.<br/><br/>The key to playing Chen effectively is to be active immediately from the start, using converted creeps to farm, stack neutral camps, harass the enemy in-lane, scout enemy movement, and disable enemies during ganks. In the laning phase, neutral creeps can be much stronger than heroes, and when massed together or using their abilities can be a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Assigning command groups to converted creeps allows them to be micromanaged and issued individual commands or moved as a group. Proper management of Chen's creeps is crucial for playing the hero effectively.<br/><br/>Remember that creeps can not only provide attack power and abilities in fights, they can be used to body-block enemies to prevent them from chasing or running away as effectively. If the opportunity presents itself, try to use your creeps to hinder the enemy's movements.<br/><br/>Like other controllable units, creeps can provide very strong benefits to Chen's team no matter their abilities or survivability. They can be moved around to scout enemy movement and provide vision, extremely useful at night, or can be used to safely check inside Roshan's pit. As with body-blocking enemy heroes' movements, they can also get in the way of enemy spells as well, such as Sacred Arrow, Fatal Bonds and Meat Hook.<br/><br/>Conversely, beware of enemies that can take advantage of the creeps' numbers and turn them against him. An Echo Slam or Overwhelming Odds can deal heavy damage to allied heroes by using the creeps as additional multipliers, Astral Spirit can absorb additional attack damage and movement speed for Elder Titan, Sleight of Fist can deal large amounts of cleave damage if Ember Spirit has a Battle Fury, and so on. Beware of what abilities enemy heroes have that can counter your creeps, and plan accordingly.<br/><br/>While creeps from small camps have low damage, they can be quite powerful if their abilities are used properly. However, the existence of only one small camp in each jungle makes obtaining a specific creep unlikely, on top of the small creep camp usually being used to pull lane creeps.<br/>The Kobold Foreman from the Kobold Camp or Hill Troll and Kobold Camp can be a useful utility creep to provide increased movement speed to Chen and his creeps. The aura can help initiation creeps to close the distance faster, or allow them to traverse to their destination more efficiently.<br/><br/>The Hill Troll Priest from the Hill Troll Camp is a useful utility creep for the early game. Its mana aura can help keep Chen and his creeps' mana topped up, as well as that of teammates, and the heal can be extremely helpful for keeping Chen's congregation alive and for healing Chen himself and his teammates, increasing their survivability in the laning stage.<br/><br/>The Ghost from the Ghost Camp can inflict a slow on its target, reducing their movement speed and potentially allowing Chen and his team to catch up to fleeing enemies and hit them with harder disables.<br/><br/>The Harpy Stormcrafter from the Harpy Camp possesses the Chain Lightning ability, which deals a surprising amount of damage at low mana cost and cooldown. It is an extremely powerful harasser and pusher, as it can apply a large amount of magic nuke damage to an enemy and force them out of the lane. The nuke can also be used to farm neutral camps or push lanes to take towers.<br/><br/><br/>Each jungle has two medium camps, which contain some useful creeps with strong abilities.<br/>The Centaur Conqueror from the Centaur Camp is one of the most well-rounded creeps, as its high HP makes it a beefy fighter and War Stomp allows it to stun enemy heroes for 2 seconds each. Amassing multiple Centaur Conquerors allows Chen to push very strongly, or to chain-stun an enemy with consecutive stomps.<br/><br/>The Alpha Wolf from the Wolf Camp can be a strong creep to obtain in the mid and late game. Its Packleader's Aura can greatly boost your carry's damage output based on their base damage, giving your team an advantage in fights.<br/><br/>The Satyr Banisher from the Satyr Camp and Large Satyr Camp is a surprisingly strong creep that possesses a strong utility ability. Converting the Banisher will more than double its HP, negating its low natural health. Its Purge can be used either to remove debuffs from Chen's allies or Chen himself, or to greatly slow an enemy every five seconds while also removing buffs.<br/><br/>The Satyr Mindstealer from the same neutral camps is a useful harassment creep. While its Mana Burn has a respectably long cooldown, it costs very little mana to cast, allowing to be used to whittle down an enemy's mana and HP repeatedly, forcing them to return to base.<br/><br/>The Ogre Frostmage from the Ogre Camp is a very useful defensive creep that can be useful depending on both teams' lineups. Its Ice Armor ability (not to be confused with that of Lich) provides additional armor to allies and reduces the effectiveness of enemy melee attacks due to the attack speed slow. It can be a powerful creep to have if your team has several heroes that can benefit from additional armor such as Huskar and Phoenix, or if the enemy has melee carries that depend on their right-clicks to win fights. As well, the armor can make pushes more effective by providing lane creeps and Chen's flock with additional armor to tank creep attacks and tower hits.<br/><br/>Mud Golems from the Golem Camp provide beefiness and a short-interval disable. Hurl Boulder inflicts a short-duration stun at long range, useful for cancelling channeled enemy abilities, hindering a foe long enough to hit them with a longer duration disable, or breaking Linken's Sphere. The Mud Golem can also split into two Shard Golems, which can further disable an enemy with the same disable.<br/><br/><br/>Large camps contain the most powerful creeps short of ancient creeps, many of which can be utilized to great purpose.<br/>The Satyr Tormenter from the Large Satyr Camp is a useful nuking and harassing creep. While it is very slow, its Shockwave can be used to harass down enemies during the laning stage, and can also be used to nuke down creep waves and neutral camps. As well, its Unholy Aura can be a very strong pushing aura, as it provides HP regen to Chen (stacks with other HP regen auras including Helm of the Dominator) , his congregation, and any nearby lane creeps attempting to take a tower.<br/><br/>The Hellbear Smasher from the Hellbear Camp is a beefy fighter that can be useful as a disabler and pusher. Its Thunder Clap can be used to slow gank targets, making them easier to chase and hit with unreliable disables, or as a damage nuke to farm or push. Its Swiftness Aura increases the attack speed of allied units, allowing lane creeps to deal more damage during a push.<br/><br/>The Wildwing Ripper from the Wildwing Camp can be used as a nuker, harasser and pusher. By channeling a Tornado, Chen can either slowly whittle down a neutral camp that has been stacked multiple times, harass an enemy with an invulnerable tornado, or work down lane creeps during a push. The Wildwing Ripper's Toughness Aura also provides armor to all nearby creeps, increasing their physical toughness.<br/><br/>The Dark Troll Summoner from the Troll Camp is a well-balanced disabler, farmer and pusher. Of all neutral creeps, it possesses one of the strongest disables, as Ensnare is a ranged single-target disable that can root through spell immunity, making it a powerful ganking spell. It can also summon minions with Raise Dead, allowing Chen to jungle more effectively or provide extra pushing power.<br/><br/><br/>Ancient creeps can only be converted if Chen possesses an Aghanim's Scepter, and even then only based on how many levels of Hand of God he has. However, they are significantly more powerful than other creeps.<br/>Ancient creeps generally have high magic resistance, letting them shrug off most enemy nukes, and the Ancient classification allows them to ignore many abilities. As such, bringing ancient creeps to a fight can provide a powerful advantage since the enemy will be unable to kill them as easily, if at all.<br/><br/>The Ancient Black Dragon from the Dragon Camp can be used as a powerful pusher. Its Splash Attack can make short work of creep waves, while its Dragonhide Aura can give nearby allies an armor bonus. Fireball is a powerful damage-over-time ability that can be used for pushing or zoning out enemies.<br/><br/>The Ancient Granite Golem from the Large Golem Camp possesses one of the most powerful auras available to Chen, increasing the maximum health of all nearby units by 15% with its Granite Aura. Applying the aura to Chen's teammates can make them much harder to kill in teamfights.<br/><br/>The Ancient Thunderhide from the Thunderhide Camp can be a formidable pusher. Its War Drums Aura increases the physical damage output of all nearby allies through bonus damage and attack speed, and it can cast Frenzy to further boost its own attack speed, allowing it to make short work of enemy creeps.<br/><br/>The Ancient Prowler Shaman from the Prowler Camp has less health than most Ancients and lacks magic resistance, but is very powerful against enemy heroes. Desecrate applies an armor debuff in an area to bolster allies' physical damage output, and Petrify provides a Spell Immunity-piercing root that can be lethal in a teamfight or gank.<br/><br/>The Ancient Prowler Acolyte, also from the Prowler Camp, has little offensive presence and is relatively fragile, but the bonus lifesteal and health regeneration from Prowler Aura can greatly enhance allies' survivability.<br/><br/><br/>Always remember that Chen's creeps do not always have to be at his side, and that they can still be controlled even if Chen himself is dead. Be sure to take advantage of this in order to accomplish as much with the creeps as possible.<br/><br/>Remember that Holy Persuasion increases the maximum HP of smaller creeps, giving them more survivability in fights and ganks. It can be worthwhile to convert small creeps with special abilities, as they can accomplish more due to their increased HP.<br/><br/>If possible, try to avoid allowing the enemy to kill Chen's creeps. Not only does this provide the enemy with gold and experience, but Chen will be forced to find another creep to convert, wasting time and mana. Each of Chen's creeps must ultimately serve a purpose for his team, so losing them to the enemy can set him back considerably depending on its role.<br/><br/>Be especially wary of certain heroes that can make short work of Chen's creeps. Heroes that can instantly destroy them like Clinkz, Doom, Enigma Lifestealer can remove them from play virtually instantly, and benefit from killing the creeps as well. As well, Enchantress can simply take control of Chen's creeps and use them against him, and Lion can render them impotent by removing their mana pool.<br/><br/>During the jungling phase, it can sometimes be worthwhile to convert weaker creeps to Chen's side rather than the largest one available. Keep in mind that a converted creep provides no gold or experience for Chen, and while it can be better utilized for farming, converting it also denies Chen the maximum possible gold and experience gain from that camp.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b></b><br/><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve give Chen the ability to sustain his HP. Generally converted creeps should be used to tank neutral camps while jungling, however, so HP regen can be skipped for other items.<br/><br/>Clarity is useful for replenishing Chen's mana pool, which is important given how frequently Chen must cast Holy Persuasion while jungling. Keeping Chen's mana up allows him to jungle continuously.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection gives Chen armor, useful for giving him physical survivability if he must tank creep attacks occasionally. It can be upgraded into a Ring of Basilius later.<br/><br/>Animal Courier is important to buy as a support. Since Chen can jungle fairly independently with only mana as a requirement, he is a good candidate for purchasing the courier.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed give Chen more movement speed, crucial for moving between jungle camps faster, as well as for extra mobility while rotating for ganks with his creeps. Getting within range to cast Penitence on an enemy hero can slow them enough for follow-ups, and the same applies to being able to nuke them with Test of Faith.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius is a good jungling item and pushing. It gives Chen additional attack damage as well as a mana aura, allowing him to maintain his mana pool more easily. The Basilius Aura also gives his creeps more armor, increasing their tankiness, and provides them with mana regen as well, allowing them to recover any mana expended while casting spells. The armor aura can be very powerful for pushing down early towers since allied creeps will survive for longer against tower hits.<br/><br/>Headdress is a useful early-game intermediary item to purchase. Its HP regen aura can allow Chen's creeps to recover their HP, allowing them to jungle more easily and ensuring that they are at full HP when used to gank enemies. Like Ring of Basilius, it is also a strong pushing aura that allows allied creeps to survive for longer during a tower siege.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots allow Chen to replenish his and his creeps' mana pools, ensuring that spells are always ready to be cast. As well, keeping allies' mana pools topped up allows them to use their abilities more often, useful when pushing towers.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator gives one more creep and good stats and health regen.<br/><br/><br/>Mekansm, purchased early enough, allows Chen to push down towers very quickly as he can heal his creeps and teammates to prevent the enemy from easily defending. In teamfights, it gives Chen an additional ability with which to heal his team, on top of Hand of God.<br/><br/>Observer Ward are crucial to purchase regularly as Chen, both as a support and as a pusher. Providing map vision to his team allows Chen to keep an eye on enemy movements, which in turn allows him to position himself and his creeps to best meet the threat, or to push an undefended tower.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter Chen gains the ability to cast Holy Persuasion on ancient creeps, which can bolster his pushing ability as well as set him up for the late game.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a strong teamfight and pushing aura that greatly benefits Chen's creeps. The armor aura greatly increases his creeps' survivability against physical attacks and tower hits, and the mana aura lets them recover mana more readily for casting spells. The lifesteal can allow creeps, both converted and allied lane creeps, to maintain their HP during pushes and become a bigger threat against towers.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives Chen all-around attributes and greatly increased casting ability. The Hex gives Chen a targeted instant hard-disable which is very powerful in teamfights and ganks, as it can set up chain-disables with Chen's creeps.<br/><br/>Necronomicon gives Chen yet more minions to control, greatly increasing his pushing, teamfighting and ganking power. The summons can be used to push towers, hinder enemies during teamfights, add more damage output during a gank, and at level 3 provide True Sight when needed. The item also provides bonus strength for increased HP, and bonus intelligence for more attack damage and casting ability.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Chen all-around attributes, increasing his survivability and giving him a larger mana pool. The aura gives him yet another way to strengthen his converted creeps, and the active can allow Chen and his creeps to move more swiftly to chase down a gank target or escape enemy pursuers.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter allows Chen to temporary ignore physical damage, crucial for enhancing his survivability in fights. The inability to attack is of little hindrance to Chen, since he relies on casting his spells and using his creeps' abilities more than on his auto-attacks.<br/><br/>Flying Courier is important to purchase for your team in the early game, in order to give it the mobility it needs to quickly deliver items to your teammates.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is crucial to have on Chen at all times, since he must be constantly active in the early game while he has the advantage. Moving himself around the map to participate in ganks and pushes allows him to make his presence felt by the enemy.<br/><br/>Smoke of Deceit can be powerful to carry on Chen all the time. It can provide invisibility to himself and his creeps, as well as a movement speed boost, allowing them to quickly and stealthily traverse the map in order to set up a gank on the enemy in a different lane.<br/><br/>Sentry Ward should be purchased regularly alongside Observer Wards in order to deny the enemy map vision. As well, it may be necessary to purchase these to remove any enemy wards that may be blocking Chen's neutral camps, preventing him from farming during the laning stage.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage allows Chen to apply an armor debuff on the enemy from range, stacking alongside Penitence to increase a target's vulnerability to damage. It can be further upgraded into a Solar Crest to further amplify its effects.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape gives Chen yet another way to protect his teammates from the enemy, cloaking them in invisibility while also increasing their magic resistance. The active can also be cast on a converted creep to help it get closer to an enemy to initiate with a disable.<br/><br/>Force Staff is very powerful in Chen's hands. It gives him more intelligence and HP regen, allowing Chen to cast his spells more readily. The active can quickly re-position Chen either to initiate or escape, and do the same for allies. The active can also be cast on a creep to give it a quick burst of movement to get within range for a disable.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel allows Chen to push and gank much more effectively. By teleporting to friendly creeps or even his own, Chen can get in position to gank an enemy, further helped by the item's increased movement speed, or to push an undefended tower, using Test of Faith's teleport on himself to summon his flock to aid him as needed.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a cheap mana item that gives Chen some powerful benefits. The increased intelligence and mana regen help Chen to cast his spells more frequently, and the bonus movement speed helps him with mobility for ganking, chasing and escaping. The active also allows him to make himself temporarily invulnerable if jumped on by the enemy, can remove debuffs from himself, or can be cast on an enemy to disable them long enough for a creep to disable them further.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a powerful teamfight item. It grants increased magic resistance to Chen, while providing an aura that gives his team and his creeps HP regen and magic resistance. The active can be used to protect his congregation, preventing the enemy from instantly bursting them down with magic nukes.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a survivability and support item that gives Chen increased utility. The extra HP and evasion help Chen to survive against enemy attacks more easily, and the active allows him to disarm the enemy from range, preventing them from attacking his teammates without dispelling the debuff.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Chen a powerful teamfight aura while also giving him powerful benefits. The bonus intelligence greatly increases the size of his mana pool, while the armor helps with his survivability against physical damage. The aura reduces the effectiveness of enemy attacks, and the active ability can slow their movement speed and apply a damage nuke to them.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves can be upgraded from Mekansm and Arcane Boots, giving Chen yet another inventory slot. The aura gives Chen's team a survivability advantage in fights, while the active can heal them, restore mana, and remove debuffs from Chen that may be preventing him from supporting his team.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Crystal Maiden is an efficient support who specializes in slowing enemies. Her highly valued Arcane Aura increases mana regeneration for all her teammates, while she remains effective throughout the game with very little items. In large fights, she can channel a Freezing Field to obliterate enemies over a wide area, along with using Frostbite to target individuals. However, Crystal Maiden is quite fragile even compared to other supports, and is one of the slowest heroes in the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Gives team mana regeneration.<br/><br/>Numerous slows.<br/><br/>Not item dependent.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low movement speed.<br/><br/>Very fragile.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Crystal Maiden is a well-rounded support who possesses good early-game disabling and roaming capability. She is also an easy hero to learn, as her abilities are straightfoward and give her team strong disabling and nuking potential.<br/><br/>Like most intelligence casters, Crystal Maiden is extremely squishy and easy to kill if focused down by the enemy. This is further exacerbated by her low base movement speed, tied with Invoker for the second-lowest base movement speed in the game. Due to her strong disable potential, she can most effectively mitigate this and by building mobility items that give her a measure of escape, since it doubles to give her initiation potential.<br/><br/>Because her abilities are strongest in the laning stage of a match, Crystal Maiden can greatly aid her team by being extremely active on the map as early as possible.<br/><br/>Crystal Maiden is most often played as her team's hard support, babysitting her safe lane carry and purchasing the support items for her team. Because she does not require farm in order to be effective, she can afford to spend most of a match with few items more than basic boots and a Town Portal Scroll.<br/><br/>Rylai's strong disable repertoire makes her a very strong early roamer, as she can disable and nuke down enemies in order to secure kills in the laning stage.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Crystal Nova</h4>Crystal Nova is a large area of effect nuke that also slows enemies' movement and attack speed.<br/><br/>Crystal Nova's long cast range and wide radius allows Rylai to hit enemies 1100 units away (700 casting range + 400 radius), making it a strong initiating slow that can hinder enemies' attempts to run away so that Crystal Maiden and her teammates can more easily pursue.<br/><br/>In teamfights, cast Crystal Nova early on, as the movement speed slow can hinder enemies' movements and set up spells for teammates, while the attack speed slow can reduce their ability to fight. Its low cooldown allows Rylai to cast it multiple times over the course of an engagement, so casting it early in a teamfight will give it more time to come off cooldown to be used as a supplementary nuke and slow afterward.<br/><br/>Crystal Nova provides ground vision in its casting radius for a short duration. This allows it to be used to scout high-ground areas, particularly for checking elevated cliffs for enemy wards or inside Roshan's pit.<br/><h4>Frostbite</h4>Frostbite roots the target enemy while also disarming them and dealing damage over time.<br/><br/>Frostbite can be a strong disable due to its ability to instantly immobilize an enemy. It also interrupts channeling abilities by applying a mini-stun upon cast. While it does not prevent enemies from casting spells, it can inhibit True Blink abilities, as well as Charge of Darkness and Phase Shift. Depending on the enemy lineup, maxing out Frostbite first can give Crystal Maiden's team an edge in fights.<br/><br/>Frostbite lasts 10 seconds on creeps, no matter what level it is. This can be useful for jungling on the side as it will always deal 1,000 magic damage to neutrals, and can be useful for rooting enemy-controlled creeps during fights.<br/><br/>Frostbite's up-time increases drastically as it is leveled, as the cooldown decreases in tandem with the disable duration's increase. At level 4, it is possible to keep an enemy rooted for 50% of the time, so staying alive in teamfights can allow Crystal Maiden to severely hinder right-clicking carries if they have no method with which to prevent her from casting it.<br/><h4>Arcane Aura</h4>Arcane Aura provides a global aura that replenishes teammates' mana over time, with the bonus doubling for Crystal Maiden herself.<br/><br/>Arcane Aura benefits the whole team greatly in the laning stage, as allies with strong nukes or disables can cast their spells profligately to gain a lane advantage. Even past the laning stage, at max level it restores more mana than using Arcane Boots on all teammates globally whenever it is off cooldown, which allows all allied heroes, especially those with small mana pools, to cast spells much more frequently.<br/><br/>It is wise to get at least one level of Arcane Aura in the early game. As Rylai's low base intelligence greatly limits her ability to cast her disables during the laning stage, having some form of early mana replenishment goes a long way towards improving her ganking prowess.<br/><br/>When choosing when to level up Arcane Aura, you should bear in mind your team's composition, as well as that of the enemy. If the enemy has numerous mana-destroying spells or your team can benefit from the mana regen in-lane, then taking at least a couple early levels can give your team the freedom to use their spells more frequently. However, bear in mind that this comes at the cost of having fewer skill points in your disables in the early game, weakening your ability to gank enemies.<br/><h4>Freezing Field</h4>Freezing Field is a channeled spell that summons a blizzard around Crystal Maiden, greatly slowing all enemies while dealing heavy damage over time.<br/><br/>Freezing Field is an incredibly strong area nuking spell that deals more damage the closer an enemy is. However, it can be unpredictable and can be easily interrupted by Crystal Maiden's enemies if cast at the wrong time. Freezing Field also consumes a lot of mana at higher levels, so use it sparingly.<br/><br/>Freezing Field must be used at the right time to avoid interruption and being focused. Generally speaking, in an encounter it is best used after the initial nuking phase, when the enemy's stuns are on cooldown. If your team has an initiator with the capability to disable a group of enemies, such as Ravage or Black Hole, Freezing Field should be used in tandem with their mass disable. Using Freezing Field very often results in Rylai's death if cast out in the open, and she rarely is able to channel it for its full duration, but if she can maintain it even for a few seconds it will be useful for her team.<br/><br/>When positioning yourself to cast your ultimate, try to utilize trees and high ground as cover if the option presents itself. By shielding yourself in the fog of war, the enemy loses the ability to use targeted stuns to interrupt you, increasing the odds of channeling the spell for a longer duration.<br/><br/>Freezing Field can be used as a supplementary slow after Crystal Nova in a teamfight. Stacking the two slows together can reduce enemy movement speed by 50-80%, and boosted by Aghanim's Scepter can ramp up to 100% movement speed slow and -100 attack speed. Even if Freezing Field is quickly interrupted, the slows and damage can greatly inhibit the enemy and give Crystal Maiden's team an opportunity to catch the enemy with further area disables and nukes.<br/><br/>In general, it is not recommended to level up Freezing Field every time it is available, as it is highly situational and increases drastically in mana cost as it's skilled more. However, its slow and gigantic (if unpredictable) damage can be very useful in early game, especially against enemies that lack the means to interrupt it, so taking one point in it early on and leaving it at level 1 until much later can give you access to the ultimate while preserving your mana pool and freeing up your skill points for other abilities. Overall, let your decision be informed by the enemy lineup as well as laning composition.<br/><br/>When ganking, it is important to layer your disables, even among your own spells. While Crystal Nova's cooldown prevents it from being used too often in an engagement, Frostbite's 6 second cooldown at max level allows you to cast it twice in quick succession. The most effective way to disable a target is to Frostbite them first, and then apply Crystal Nova right before its duration ends. The slow from Crystal Nova can prevent an enemy from moving too far before Frostbite comes off of cooldown, which can be cast again before the slow debuff expires.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve provides Crystal Maiden with enough basic regen to remain in-lane and support her teammates without being harassed away and being forced to return to base.<br/><br/>Clarity is a useful purchase due to Crystal Maiden's low base intelligence preventing her from casting too many spells in the laning stage. The additional mana replenishment can allow her to bring both of her disables to bear on an enemy, greatly increasing the odds of a kill during a gank.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength can give Crystal Maiden more HP, which can help extend her survivability.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should always be purchased by Crystal Maiden.<br/><br/>Observer Wards should be purchased regularly and placed at key areas around the map. As a support, giving your team map vision is critical to victory.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Wand is very useful on Crystal Maiden as it is a cheap way to give her stats and more survivability, key requirements for hard support heroes. The increased charge storage also allows her to restore up to 255 HP and mana instantly, which can allow her to do more in fights.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are a crucial early purchase on Crystal Maiden due to her extremely low base movement speed. Increasing her mobility allows Rylai to get within range to cast her disables on her foes, or outrun pursuing enemies.<br/><br/>Bracer can be upgraded from Gauntlets of Strength to provide a good mix of attributes, the strength bonus being especially useful to improve Crystal Maiden's survivability.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is mandatory for all heroes, but should be carried in surplus on Crystal Maiden as her disables can drastically turn ganks around.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can using it to effectively gained mana.<br/><br/>Flying Courier is important to purchase as early as possible if gold permits, in order to facilitate delivery of items to teammates around the map.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Tranquil Boots are the cheapest upgradable boots available, and allow Crystal Maiden to remain out in the field for extended periods of time. As Arcane Aura restores her mana pool while Tranquil Boots's passive heals her, Crystal Maiden can stay out in the field indefinitely and never need to return to base. The increased movement speed and extra armor are also a boon, allowing her to roam, gank and flee more effectively.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity grants Crystal Maiden additional movement speed, allowing her to be more mobile, and grants her a larger mana pool and mana regeneration. The active can be cast on yourself to make yourself temporarily invulnerable while also removing debuffs, or as an additional disable against enemies.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger augments Rylai's mobility, allowing her to instantly jump within range for locking down enemy heroes with her disables. The improved mobility also allows her to move around the map more easily to support her teammates, or escape pursuing enemies.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives Crystal Maiden stats across the board and can be upgraded from an already-purchased Bracer. The extra movement speed can also increase her movement speed, allowing her to position herself for casting spells more easily.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards should be regularly purchased in order to destroy enemy Observer Wards, as well as to counter invisible enemy heroes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Black King Bar is an expensive luxury item that should be considered only if given farm priority and all other support duties have been met. It prevents interruptions to her ultimate, as well as increasing the size of Rylai's health pool.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter can give Crystal Maiden a large amount of lockdown ability with Freezing Field, as well as give her stats across the board, particularly her health and mana pool, giving her both extra survivability to cast the ultimate and the mana to do so at higher levels. If your team can prevent Freezing Field from being interrupted, it can be a strong luxury item to invest in once you have the mobility to deploy it reliably.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a good cheap support item to build on Crystal Maiden if saving up for a Blink Dagger is unfeasible. It provides Rylai with repositioning abilities, and increases the size of her mana pool to allow her to cast her disables more easily.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter gives survivability against auto-attacking carries by granting Rylai a brief period of invulnerability to physical damage, as well as some additional stats. The active is also useful for shielding her from attack damage during Freezing Field, preventing enemies from ending the channel by attacking her.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very expensive support item, however it gives a very reliable ranged hard-disable, a larger mana pool and some more HP, and a powerful mana regeneration boost.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Crystal Maiden a strong area slow which synergizes with Crystal Nova and Freezing Field. The armor bonus also makes her much more resistant to physical damage, making it harder to focus her down.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape can be a useful item to purchase if you intend on making use of Freezing Field regularly, and is otherwise a good support item. Casting the active on yourself prior to jumping in with your ultimate can give you a little extra time to channel it, allowing you to deal more damage. In other situations, it can give you or an ally the ability to stealthily initiate on targets you have vision on, or can be used as an escape or survivability tool by granting someone on your team invisibility and greatly increased magic resistance.<br/><br/>Null Talisman is a useful alternative to Bracer when purchased as a stat booster. It provides a useful amount of bonus intelligence, bolstering Rylai's meager base mana pool and allowing her to cast her spells more readily as needed. It can build into a Veil of Discord later in order to provide utility to her team.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good utility item to build over Bracer as a roaming Crystal Maiden, as it can add to her damage nukes or be used to recover health after ganks. The additional strength gives her HP, while the mana regeneration works alongside Arcane Aura to keep her mana topped up.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a cheap utility item that gives Rylai many benefits. Besides the all-around stats, the additional armor helps her survive against physical damage, the greatly increased intelligence improves the size of her mana pool, and the magic resistance reduction against enemies allows her to do more damage with her magic nukes, especially Freezing Field.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is a strong caster item that greatly improves Crystal Maiden's disabling capabilities. The item provides additional mana, improving the utility of Arcane Aura and facilitating casting spells from her small mana pool, and the HP regen works alongside Tranquil Boots in keeping her health topped up. The increased cast range allows Rylai to cast Frostbite and Crystal Nova from longer ranges to catch enemies with her disables, while the spell damage amp increases the lethality of her nukes.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a situational purchase that can improve Crystal Maiden's ability to support her team. It improves her overall stats while providing extra armor, and the active allows her to heal her teammates and herself in teamfights, improving overall team survivability.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dark Seer is a semi-support hero, most focused on AOE Battles. He is able to farm safely due to Ion Shell which can also be used to damage his enemies. He can make himself and his allies reach incredible speeds with Surge, along with using Vacuum and Wall of Replica in conjuction with each other to initiate and deal damage using the enemies' own power.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong solo offlaner.<br/><br/>Extremely annoying to lane against.<br/><br/>Strong team fight presence.<br/><br/>Excellent at escaping or disengaging.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Melee attack range.<br/><br/>Initiation combo often requires a followup.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>If laning, be sure to harass enemies with Ion Shell by placing it on their melee creeps (for melee heroes) or ranged creeps (for ranged heroes). Additionally, placing Ion Shell on the second allied melee creep to arrive at the creep line is a good way to push the lane as well as create a moving damage-dealing creep that chases enemy heroes. This can make it hard for the enemy carry to last hit, as they have to do it under the tower and while taking damage from creep aggro and ion shell at the same time.<br/><br/>Dark Seer can farm rapidly in lane and jungle thanks to Ion Shell. To jungle, stack the hard and medium camps several times, and then place an ion shell on one of the lesser creeps. The shell should clear out the whole camp(including the stacks). Do this repeatedly to accumulate a large sum of gold. However, be sure to stay within experience range.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Vacuum</h4>Due to Vacuum being able to clump up a large group of enemies fast, and Ion Shell's high damage output considering enemies are affected by it for a longer while, they permit Dark Seer to synergize extremely well with heroes such as Enigma and Jakiro. Make sure to cast these abilities with Black Hole and Ice Path/ Macropyre/ Liquid Fire to maximize AoE damage and maybe turn the tide in battle.<br/><br/>AoE spells, especially those that require positioning, greatly benefit from Vacuum, as it can place all of them together to ensure a hit.<br/><h4>Ion Shell</h4>When chasing, self-cast Ion Shell and run next to the enemy without attacking, using Surge if the enemy is faster. Even better, use surge to body-block enemy heroes (that is, get in front of them to hinder their movement) and deal damage with basic attacks without moving out of range of the Ion Shell.<br/><h4>Surge</h4>Surge can be cast on the team's Animal Courier, allowing it to get out of danger, or finish its delivery to allies faster.<br/><br/>While normally pushing the lane is a bad thing, Surge and his high Strength gain makes it hard for the enemies to lock down Dark Seer and kill him.<br/><h4>Wall of Replica</h4>Using Vacuum on enemy heroes to send them through Wall of Replica disallows foes from preventing illusions, as well as causing guaranteed damage from passing through the Wall.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Stout Shield gives you resistance to physical attacks whether you are laning or jungling.<br/><br/>Tangoes cover your health and mana issues until you build up your early game items.<br/><br/>Iron Branches is beneficial with its early boost to Dark Seer's attributes, but also help you build up to a Magic Wand and/or Mekansm later on.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can be considered as it can be assembled in the side shop and lets your team use the courier more. This is especially important if your midlaner plans on getting a Bottle quickly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Soul Ring covers most of your mana issues and allows you to constantly cast your Ion Shell in order to harass your lane opponents and get some last hits.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed gives mobility for chasing or running away.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Magic Wand allows you to sustain your presence in fights.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots increase your mana pool and allow you to give your teammates mana.<br/><br/>Mekansm adds to Dark Seer's teamfight effectiveness and increases your durability. Also his decent Intelligence gain means he will generally have enough mana to use the heal.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll allows you to be at any lane for a gank, countergank, or push in seconds.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Bottle can also be used to sustain high mana use, if the Dark Seer is put midlane. It has the added benefit of rune control as most runes are useful for Ion Shell harass.<br/><br/>Crimson Guard can protect your team from enemy carries in teamfights.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter effectively allows your illusions to deal more damage than your opponents, thereby significantly increasing your team fight potential.<br/><br/>Hood of Defiance grants you magic resist and a lot of health regeneration, and can be upgraded into a Pipe of Insight.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight grants you and your allies protection from magic damage.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger can help you positioning to place a better Wall into Vacuum combo.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter should be considered to counter high physical damage dealers and it is relatively cheap.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is always a great pickup for the hex and mana regen. If you need to turn off a carry's damage output, this is a very strong pickup.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard grants you more punch to your Vacuum and Wall of Replica initiation, and gives you armor and intelligence.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque allows you to initiate with little fear of dying.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb allows you to cast your abilities and items twice in a row if needed.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Dazzle is a support hero most well known for his ability to save his teammates from death using Shallow Grave as well as his physical damage-focused spells. He can slow and later stun single targets with Poison Touch, heal and harm with Shadow Wave, and increase and decrease the armor of his allies and enemies respectively using Weave. His item-independent nature allows him to be played as a hard support and remain effective at all stages of the game.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Low cooldown ultimate.<br/><br/>Capable of making clutch saves.<br/><br/>Does not require items to perform role.<br/><br/>Strong 5-man enabler.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Offensive spells deal physical damage.<br/><br/>Requires attentiveness and good timing during big team fights.<br/><br/>Not particularly durable himself.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Due to Dazzle's potent defensive abilities, teamfights tend to last longer than usual.<br/><br/>Dazzles abilities require him to be close to his teammates at all times.<br/><br/>Like most intelligence support casters, Dazzle suffers from poor strength and agility, rendering him very weak against all types of damage and making him an easy kill. However, his strength is that he has very high intelligence growth, meaning that he greatly benefits from building scaling mana regen items that maintain his mana pool and facilitate continued use of his low-cooldown spells.<br/><br/>Like all other casting-focused heroes, be particularly mindful of silences that the enemy may attempt to cast on Dazzle during engagements. As a hard support, Dazzle will not always have the gold to purchase items to dispel debuffs from himself, so long-duration silences can easily prevent him from casting his spells to save his teammates in fights.<br/><br/>Because of his ability to save teammates from certain death, Dazzle greatly benefits from building items that aid in his positioning or allow him to cast his spells more easily. As well, this ability to save teammates' lives also means that Dazzle himself may become a priority target for the enemy team to eliminate from the battlefield. Mobility items can kill two birds with one stone, allowing Dazzle to re-position to cast his spells on his teammates, or to quickly escape enemy attempts on his life.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Poison Touch</h4>Poison Touch deals an increasing slow on a target enemy, then deals physical damage over time.<br/><br/>Poison Touch is a strong ganking spell, as its respectable cast range and slow duration can allow allies to quickly close in to land stronger disables on a gank target. At least one value point is recommended in all situations, as the slow can also be useful for fending off enemies trying to pursue teammates.<br/><br/>At max level, Poison Touch inflicts a 1 second stun on its target 2 seconds after the projectile impacts. While this prevents Dazzle from easily interrupting enemy channels (particularly Town Portal Scroll), the spell's cooldown eventually reduces to less than half of the initial 15 seconds, allowing the debuff to be active on an enemy at all times.<br/><br/>Due to its damage over time nature, Poison Touch can be useful for inhibiting enemy Blink Daggers. Even if they create enough distance to escape immediate incoming damage from Dazzle and his team, their Blink Dagger will be disabled for at least 13 seconds after the spell is cast. However, be mindful that Poison Touch itself deals no damage for the first two slow instances, so try to inflict the target with a source of player-based damage prior to casting Poison Touch.<br/><h4>Shallow Grave</h4>Shallow Grave, Dazzle's signature spell, places an unpurgeable buff on an ally that prevents them from dying due to damage for the next 5 seconds.<br/><br/>At least one value point in Shallow Grave is recommended no matter how Dazzle is skilled. The ability to prevent an ally's death for 5 seconds can completely change gank and teamfight outcomes, allowing a teammate to survive a situation in which they would otherwise die.<br/><br/>In general, it is best to cast Shallow Grave on a target just before they receive a killing blow. Casting Shallow Grave too early can waste some of its duration on a teammate who still has some health left, as the spell is only truly useful if it prevents damage that would otherwise kill the target. However, be mindful that the spell has a longer cast animation than the rest of Dazzle's abilities, require 0.4 seconds to cast instead of 0.3. Keep in mind the enemy team's composition and their ability to deal sudden burst damage, and when in doubt casting earlier is better than later.<br/><br/>Shallow Grave is Dazzle's most expensive ability, costing 150 mana at all levels. While leveling it up will not increase its mana cost, doing so also means that the rest of Dazzle's abilities will be weaker at each respective level. Know when to prioritize leveling Dazzle's other spells first, depending on the situation.<br/><br/>When deciding when to level up Shallow Grave, keep in mind how active you expect both teams to be throughout a match. If the enemy has a gank-heavy lineup and intends to make numerous attempts to take early teamfights or kill your teammates in ganks, maxing out Shallow Grave early can frustrate their attempts to secure kills, buying your team time and space to farm up items to defeat them later. If your team expects to take the initiative and fight early on against a greedy farming lineup, Shallow Grave can be left at a single level and saved during calculated ganks and fights, allowing Dazzle to expend his skill points on other offensive spells.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Shallow Grave can be cast offensively as well as defensively. Holding Shallow Grave in reserve can allow teammates to dive enemy towers in the early game and extend farther than otherwise possible, in the knowledge that Shallow Grave can be cast to cover their retreat.<br/><br/>Be mindful that allies affected by Shallow Grave are only prevented from dying during the spell; when the duration ends they are left with however much health they have and can be easily finished off by pursuing enemies. Try to use healing abilities and items on teammates just before the spell expires, but not too early so as not to waste the heal during the spell.<br/><br/>Combined with a Town Portal Scroll, Shallow Grave can be used as an escape spell provided that the enemy has no interrupting disables. If Dazzle or an ally encounter a hopeless situation and the enemy has expended their disables, casting Shallow Grave and then teleporting back to base can be a life-saver; enemies will be unable to kill or interrupt the target during the teleport channel, and they can emerge back at base and heal back to full health. However, beware of damage-over-time spells like Dual Breath that could otherwise finish the job in the fountain, as well as global damage nukes that can finish off low-health targets before they can fully recover like Sun Strike and Thundergod's Wrath.<br/><br/>Because it uses the pre-heal mechanic, Shallow Grave will always set a target's health to be exactly 1 point higher than any damage instance that would otherwise kill them. This means that while Blade Mail will still continue to reflect damage during the buff, it also means that damage from abilities like Fatal Bonds can still be spread to the target's allies.<br/><br/>The cast range of Shallow Grave increases with each level; it starts out the same range as your normal attack, but at level 4 goes to almost twice that distance. Higher levels of Shallow Grave not only reduce the cooldown, but allow Dazzle to save his allies from farther away.<br/><h4>Shadow Wave</h4>Shadow Wave instantly heals the target allied unit alongside a number of other allied units in an area, while dealing physical damage in a small radius around each heal target.<br/><br/>Despite its small numbers, Shadow Wave is a very strong healing spell as its extremely low cooldown allows it to be spammed over short periods of time and heal multiple allies at once. Maxing it out early can give Dazzle's team a strong survivability advantage in early teamfights while simultaneously increasing his physical damage output.<br/><br/>Each ally healed by Shadow Wave will deal an instance of damage in a small radius around themselves. This means that if multiple allies are clustered around an enemy unit at melee range, that enemy will be hit with multiple instances of physical damage. This makes Shadow Wave a very strong offensive spell when combined with teammates who can summon crowds of units to attack enemies at melee range, such as Broodmother, Phantom Lancer and Meepo.<br/><br/>Because it heals and damages in larger numbers with crowded allies, Shadow Wave is particularly strong at defending and pushing lanes due to lane creeps being present in large numbers and fighting at melee range. A single cast of Shadow Wave can deal significant damage to enemy creep waves, allowing Dazzle to destroy a single wave in two casts of the spell.<br/><br/>If not targeting himself, Dazzle is always added as a unit for healing and damaging for Shadow Wave. This can be useful for adding an extra instance of damage in fights and ganks, provided that Dazzle can position himself close to the enemy target, and can be useful for bouncing Shadow Wave's damage to enemy ranged and siege creeps when pushing lanes.<br/><h4>Weave</h4>Weave applies a buff to allies and a debuff to enemies within its radius, increasing allied armor and decreasing enemy armor over time.<br/><br/>Weave is a very strong teamfight ultimate since it can hearten allies for battle before a teamfight or give the enemy pause before they engage. As the respective buff and debuff cannot be purged by either side, the enemy will be unable to counter its effects should they decide to fight, and allies will get progressively stronger or enemies weaker the longer a teamfight progresses.<br/><br/>Due to its gradual nature, it is best to try to cast Weave as early as possible before teamfights, as the armor shift is very small at the start of the spell's duration but grows to become extremely impactful after just a few seconds.<br/><br/>Because it is most impactful after it has run its course for at least a few seconds, Weave can only practically be cast either on Dazzle's team to buff allied armor or on the opposing team to weaken enemy armor; it is inadvised to attempt to cast Weave when both teams have already engaged in battle as it will have minimal effect. If the enemy has strong survivability or Dazzle's team has good physical damage output, casting Weave on the enemy will take away their survivability advantage or allow Dazzle's allies to capitalize on their stronger carry potential. However, if the opposing team has strong damage output or Dazzle's team has weak armor, placing the buff on Dazzle's team can allow them to engage in fights undaunted. Always take the respective team compositions and gold/experience leads into account when deciding who to most profitably cast Weave on.<br/><br/>Weave's wide radius makes it the perfect spell for breaking up Roshan attempts by the enemy team. As Roshan's pit is very cramped, it is easy to hit the entire enemy team with the debuff while revealing the inside of the pit. This can either force the enemy to break off and retreat, or risk being destroyed and losing the Aegis to Dazzle's team.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Iron Branch are cheap and provide cost-effective stats. They can be used to build into other useful items, or can be dropped in-lane to boost the healing power of a Tango.<br/><br/>Two Clarityes allow Dazzle to replenish his mana in-lane, which in turn sustain his spell-casting. It is particularly important for Dazzle since his ability to restore allies' HP with Shadow Wave makes him a very powerful support in the laning stage.<br/><br/>Healing Salve and Tango are important basic health regen items. They allow Dazzle to survive against enemy harass damage so that he is not forced to retreat out of lane and leave his lane partner vulnerable.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should always be purchased at the beginning of the round by a support.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Stick gives Dazzle burst HP and mana regen, both of which are very important on a casting support. Staying alive long enough to cast one more spell in a fight can make a significant difference.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed is crucial to purchase as early as possible on all heroes. In Dazzle's case, positioning is crucial for being able to cast his spells, and the additional movement speed allows him to chase down foes after inflicting them with Poison Touch.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows has great synergy with Dazzle's abilities. It provides extra strength for more HP, as well as a small amount of scaling mana regen that allows him to take advantage of his high intelligence growth. The Urn charges allow Dazzle to heal teammates alongside Shadow Wave, or to add more damage during ganks and fights.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a useful upgrade to Magic Stick, and can be completed from already-purchased Iron Branches. It provides extra attributes, important on a hard support, and gives Dazzle increased charge storage to greatly increase his survivability and longevity in fights.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots is the best boots item to purchase for Dazzle. It improves the size of his mana pool, allowing him to cast more spells, and allows him to replenish the mana of himself and his teammates, further boosting his ability to support his team.<br/><br/>Mekansm is an important support item that should always be purchased on one team member. It provides Dazzle with all-around attributes as well as armor, and allows him to further heal his teammates alongside Shadow Wave, lengthening their lifespans in fights.<br/><br/>Observer Wards should be purchased regularly as a support. Providing map vision for your team greatly increases the amount of information they have with which to make gameplay decisions, allowing them to engage in fights on their terms or to avoid enemy ganks.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should be carried at all times. Dazzle's ability to turn the tide of teamfights, especially with a well-placed Shallow Grave, can literally save teammates' lives, which can make or break fights and even matches.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is a good utility purchase that can be obtained through disassembling Arcane Boots. Besides improving the size of his mana pool, the item provides increased HP regen, ensuring that Dazzle's HP is always full. As Dazzle's spells greatly depend on positioning, boosting the cast range of his abilities allows him to much more easily protect his teammates, and prevents enemies from easily jumping on him when he moves in to cast.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Medallion of Courage greatly synergizes with Dazzle's abilities, all of which deal Physical damage. It provides additional armor for survivability and scaling mana regen, while the active can work alongside Weave to further augment allies' armor or further debilitate that of his foes.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very powerful item to purchase on any support hero, gold permitting. It provides all-around attributes as well as a large amount of intelligence and mana regen, increasing Dazzle's overall resilience and ensuring that he will never run out of mana. The Hex allows him to hard-disable a target enemy at range, greatly improving his contribution to teamfights.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is a good utility item that increases Dazzle's teamfight contribution. It provides Dazzle with a large amount of armor, boosting his survivability, as well as intelligence to increase the size of his mana pool. Freezing Aura reduces enemies' attack speed, debilitating their ability to harm Dazzle's team with physical attacks, while Arctic Blast deals damage and slows in an area around Dazzle, stacking alongside Poison Touch and allowing teammates to more easily group around them for an offensively cast Shadow Wave.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly boosts the power of Weave, alongside giving Dazzle all-around stats. The increased Weave radius allows Dazzle to more easily inflict enemies with the debuff, and can potentially allow him to cast it on both allies and enemies simultaneously. The increased armor shift rate will more quickly give teammates more survivability or more quickly destroy that of the enemy, allowing Dazzle's team to engage in fights earlier during the ultimate and spend more time fighting foes under a strong advantage.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a situationally strong utility item that further improves Dazzle's ability to protect his team. As he can already protect them against Physical damage with Weave, protecting them against Magical damage with Barrier will give the enemy very few openings with which to harm Dazzle's allies. The vastly improved HP regen and magic resistance also make Dazzle himself much harder to eliminate in fights, allowing him to always be ready to protect his teammates.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a very strong utility item that can be obtained relatively cheaply. The improved intelligence and powerful scaling mana regen allow Dazzle to easily cast his spells whenever he needs to, while the improved base movement speed helps with positioning and chasing down or fleeing enemies. The active allows Dazzle to give himself temporary invulnerability while also purging debuffs from himself, or can be used to disable enemies while removing buffs, particularly if they are attempting to chase down and kill one of Dazzle's allies.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a cheap and easily built item that grants all-around stats. The aura boosts Dazzle's mobility and gives his team extra movement and attack speed in fights, and the active can further increase his teamfight contribution.<br/><br/>Flying Courier should be purchased as soon as possible by a support, gold permitting. A flying courier is much harder to kill by the enemy, and can facilitate delivery of items to Dazzle's team much more quickly.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves can be upgraded from Arcane Boots and a purchased Mekansm. Besides eliminating the mana cost of the Mekansm component, Mend can instantly remove debuffs from Dazzle. The Guardian Aura greatly boosts the survival of Dazzle's team, particularly when they are at low health, giving Dazzle a larger window with which to cast Shallow Grave.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards are important to purchase alongside Observer Wards, for taking away enemy map vision or spotting out invisible enemy heroes. Blinding the enemy to your team's movements allows you to use your spells to greater effect, particularly casting Weave on an unsuspecting enemy team.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter improves Dazzle's survivability in the face of overwhelming physical damage. Besides providing all-around attributes, it temporarily renders him immune to physical damage, allowing him to buy himself time to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a good utility item that helps Dazzle to further protect his teammates. Besides boosting his magic resistance slightly to provide survivability against magic nukes, using the active on a teammate who is being focused can buy them time to run away while greatly boosting their magic resistance. It can also be combined with Shallow Grave, greatly improving Dazzle's chances of successfully saving a teammate's life.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a very strong support purchase that further augment's Dazzle's protective capabilities. It improves the size of Dazzle's mana pool while also providing HP regen for self-sustain. Besides allowing him to quickly re-position himself to cast his spells, casting the active on a fleeing teammate that is under the protection of Shallow Grave can immediately push them to safety, further guaranteeing their survival.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger, while expensive, is an expensive but strong positioning item that greatly improves Dazzle's mobility. Being able to instantly jump in to cast Poison Touch or Shallow Grave greatly improves Dazzle's ganking prowess and ability to save teammates from death, and in a pinch can allow him to evade enemy attempts to kill him.<br/><br/>Solar Crest, upgraded from Medallion of Courage, greatly improves the item's effectiveness in all areas. The increased mana regen further allows Dazzle to take advantage of his high intelligence growth, while the evasion component further improves allies' survivability against enemy auto-attacks.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a strong utility support item that improves Dazzle's survivability and disabling potential. It greatly improves Dazzle's HP pool while also providing a large amount of intelligence to improve his mana pool. The active allows Dazzle to greatly slow enemies from long distance, and can be used before or after Poison Touch to severely restrict an enemy's movement speed for a long period of time.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is an expensive but situationally strong utility purchase that improves Dazzle's teamfight and pushing contribution. The item improves Dazzle's strength and intelligence for more HP and mana, and summoning Necronomicon Warriors can give his team more physical damage output during fights, particularly as Dazzle can further improve their damage output with an enemy-targeted Weave.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb allows Dazzle to further protect his teammates alongside his innate spells. The item increases Dazzle's armor, improving survivability, and gives him bonus HP and mana regen to provide self-sustain. Echo Shell allows Dazzle to dispel debuffs from a target ally and bounce enemy unit-targeted spells back against them. It can discourage enemies from casting spells against important allies, or can be combined with Shallow Grave to help improve survivability.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb greatly improves the utility of Weave, as Dazzle can either instantly double its effects on allies or enemies, or place the buff and debuff simultaneously ahead of a major teamfight. As well, staggering the use of Weave can also allow Dazzle to double up on other powerful spells and items in teamfights, such as Shallow Grave. It also drastically improves Dazzle's mana regeneration, ensuring that he will never run out of mana to cast his spells.<br/><br/><br/>Under unusual situations, Dazzle can be played as a semi-carry, and utilize the "Dazzolator" build to stack armor shred items to inflict tremendous physical damage to the enemy.<br/>Power Treads is the most recommended boots item for the Dazzolator build. The increased attack speed allows Dazzle to better utilize his right-clicks for farming and fighting, while attribute switching can give him whatever attribute is required for the situation.<br/><br/>Desolator is a relatively cheap item to purchase and greatly increases the lethality of Dazzle's physical attacks. Increasing his attack damage while also causing his attacks to reduce enemy armor allows Dazzle to make quick work of enemies, particularly when combined with an enemy-targeted Weave or Solar Crest.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance is a useful supplement after acquiring Desolator. It improves Dazzle's strength, providing more HP for survivability, and increased damage and attack speed to make his physical attacks even more potent. The increased attack range combined with the attack speed allow Dazzle to "tag" multiple enemies with Desolator's armor reduction<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass, while expensive, greatly increases Dazzle's offensive potential. By improving his attack speed, Dazzle can take advantage of his high intelligence growth to utilize his highly damaging physical attacks, while the armor greatly improves his physical survivability. The enemy armor reduction aura stacks alongside Weave, causing all allied physical attacks to deal tremendous damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Death Prophet is a powerful spellcaster, who has wide Area of Effect (AoE) spells which specialize in pushing lanes and also devastating enemy defensive towers quickly in order to enter their enemy base, to gain victory within a short period of time. Exorcism can devastate towers in a short period of time, while also being a great ability for teamfights. To keep herself alive, she can use Silence and Spirit Siphon to remain active while still dealing damage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can push lanes and destroy towers quickly.<br/><br/>High survivability.<br/><br/>High base movement speed allows her to chase enemies.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Lack of escape ability.<br/><br/>Long cast animation besides Spirit Siphon.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Death Prophet is best played in the middle lane, easily farming up gold for her items with careful use of Crypt Swarm. Be cautious though as pushing too much with the area damage can leave Krobelus open to ganks, from which her only means of defense is Spirit Siphon, which is never guaranteed to ensure her survival.<br/><br/>All of Krobelus' spells are area of effect, excluding Spirit Siphon. This means that they cannot be blocked by Linken's Sphere, and while Spirit Siphon can be negated by it, its multiple charges and lack of cooldown between their usage can allow you to quickly break the shield and apply a tether, assuming you have charges to spare.<br/><br/>As Death Prophet is good in pushing lanes, keep in mind that in early stage when pushing your lane creeps too near their enemy base or defensive towers they can safe farm without worrying because the distance between their base are shorter, they can use Town Portal Scroll to defend their towers and kill your pushing lane creeps, which allows the enemy side to quickly build their items too.<br/><br/>Try to not stay alone when wonders around the enemy jungle camps, although Death Prophet has high base movement speed, she lacks escape abilities. One hard disable can brings you down if there is no reinforcements nearby.<br/><br/>In a large clash, Krobelus should be swooping around silencing and nuking enemy supports while eroding their health with Exorcism. Carries almost unfailingly have higher armor than supports, and since Exorcism is physical damage, her damage potential is highest when she focuses on the supports.<br/><br/>Given her above-average base movement speed and Phase Boots, Krobelus moves extremely fast and can often avoid damage simply by being faster than her aggressor. A Eul's Scepter of Divinity is also a common pickup on her and increases her movement speed to phenomenal levels. Krobelus tends to chase people around a lot with Exorcism, so high movement speed is a must and can also help the spirits damage enemies around Krobelus while she is safe.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Crypt Swarm</h4>Crypt Swarm is a very powerful area of effect nuke which damages enemies in a cone-shaped area. Its power falls off later in the game, but it can still clear creep waves with two uses, between which the cooldown should be very short at that point.<br/><br/>The target range of Crypt Swarm is 600 but it can travel up to 1110 range maximum, do not hesitate to harass laning enemy heroes to force them to retreat to their defensive towers.<br/><br/>Crypt Swarm is a dual sided target ability that can be targeted both onto a unit or the ground. Usually it is much easier to target the ground due to the short casting range of the spell.<br/><br/>Crypt Swarm can be used to kill enemy lane creeps with ease, as well as to prevent the enemy from denying them as the damage is higher than any hero's basic attacks during the early game. At the same time it can harass the enemy hero with some clever positioning.<br/><br/>Although Crypt Swarm has large area of effect, some enemy heroes can easily avoid Crypt Swarm by just looking at your long cast animation. Mid heroes like Puck (using Phase Shift) or Templar Assassin (using Refraction) can easily nullify your damage.<br/><br/>Since Crypt Swarm has a low cooldown and is also spamable, though as the skill level goes higher, the mana consumption will increase as well. Try to maintain your mana by avoiding careless use of the ability in the laning phrase.<br/><br/>Crypt Swarm is typically maxed first as it is a very strong AoE nuke with low cooldown, followed by Spirit Siphon, which helps her sustain in lane and survive teamfights.<br/><h4>Silence</h4>Silence is a powerful utility disable which prevent enemies from casting spells for up to 6 seconds at max level.<br/><br/>Silence has a nice long 900 cast range which can safely be cast at far distances and also has a big 425 area of effect, try to silence as many heroes as possible. The long range silence are also great to cancel powerful channeling ultimate abilities such as Black Hole, Fiend's Grip, Freezing Field and Death Ward, provided that they are not affected by spell immunity.<br/><br/>Some players might take one level of Silence during laning phase or early team fights, especially when facing hard spellcaster heroes that interrupt your action so she can secure a kill easily.<br/><br/>Remember that Silence can be dispelled by enemies, smart players can purchase dispel items such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity, Guardian Greaves, Diffusal Blade to remove the silence debuff. But silence is also a great way to forcing them to activate Black King Bar if they have it inside their inventory, so they will use it to dispel Silence, making them less protection during team fights.<br/><br/>Silence also good against those self powerful buff heroes like Ursa's Overpower, Enrage and Lifestealer's Rage which requires their spell to cast, just make sure that you inflict them with silence before they cast it.<br/><br/>Put a single point in Silence early if the enemy is reliant on spell casting, such as Dazzle, Leshrac or Lion.<br/><h4>Spirit Siphon</h4>Spirit Siphon is a powerful pseudo lifesteal that drains the enemy's health for a short period of time. Draining enemies' health lets Death Prophet sustain longer during team fights.<br/><br/>The sprite animation of Spirit Siphon works similar to Pugna's Life Drain. Unlike Pugna, she can move freely during drain until the target enemy moves outside of the break range of 750, the drain duration ends or the enemy dies. Drain and healing will continue even if the target or Death Prophet becomes disabled or invulnerable. Smart players can predict enemies movement with slow animation disables like Storm Hammer or Wraithfire Blast to recover the damage taken.<br/><br/>The health drain scales with the target enemy's max HP. The more HP that enemy is, the more health you will be drain. Thee health drain scales with the enemy's max HP, but the damage type is magical which is affected by magic resistance, resulted as draining 4.125% max HP (when maxed, with standard 25% magic resistance heroes) per second when targeting heroes, except Roshan (you cannot target it).<br/><br/>Spirit Siphon is a charge-based spell like Earth Spirit's Stone Remnant that can store up to 4 charges at max level. Besides level 1, you can cast on a single enemy after the duration finishes and cast it again without waiting for a cooldown unless you had one charge left. Keep in mind that Spirit Siphon needs 45 seconds to replenish a charge so use it wisely, without Spirit Siphon most likely you might not survive during team fights.<br/><br/>Spirit Siphon can be cast on multiple targets at once, provided enough charges are available, allowing Krobelus to replenish health very rapidly if she is standing in the middle of the enemy team.<br/><br/>Spirit Siphon also comes with a slow which, while not very heavy, can still allow you to catch up to enemies much easier, or escape from them.<br/><h4>Exorcism</h4>Exorcism is a fantastic pushing ultimate that can easily take down towers and Roshan if left unhindered. Fighting into an activated Exorcism is quite dangerous as well, which means hindering her is not easy.<br/><br/>Always remember Exorcism's damage is physical, hence, Armor reduction increases its damage. Focusing on targets with low armor (Intelligence and many Strength heroes) yields the best result of Exorcism. That said, its damage is a threat even to targets with very high armor, and those carrying a Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Remember that the Exorcism spirits have a travel time and after each attack must return to Krobelus. The closer you stand to a target, the less the spirits have to travel, thus dealing more overall damage.<br/><br/>Use Exorcism as early as it is practically possible for clashes, as the sooner it is cast the sooner her spirits will return and heal her. Her spirits will easily harvest enough life to restore her HP entirely, and the conclusion of her ultimate can save Krobelus' life; as well as severely endanger the lives of her adversaries as she returns to battle with full health.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Clarity potions allow Death Prophet to cast Crypt Swarm consecutively.<br/><br/>Tangoes and a Healing Salve provide enough early-game regeneration to keep Death Prophet in lane.<br/><br/>Mantle of Intelligence and two Iron Branches give a larger mana pool and a sufficient boost to last hitting power.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed allows Death Prophet to be more efficient at Ganking early.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is generally good to pick up because even minimum charges can mean the difference between casting a spell or not.<br/><br/>Null Talisman provides a cheap upgrade to the early Mantle of Intelligence that invaluably increases Death Prophet's mana pool, as well as giving some extra health and damage.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Phase Boots should almost always be picked up on Death Prophet due to Death Prophet's strong synergy with movement speed.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is a fairly inexpensive upgrade to the early Iron Branches and Magic Stick that provides an extra potential 75 burst heal.<br/><br/>Bloodstone is a powerful item for Death Prophet because most of her damage comes from her spells, also her strong team-fight presence allows her to quickly accumulate charges. However, this item should not be picked up if there are better Bloodstone carriers on your team.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Drum of Endurance gives good attribute boosts for the price as well as even more movement and attack speed for her team, and generally should have one person buy this item on your team in almost any situation because the buff can win team fights.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Death Prophet another nuke, as well as a larger mana pool and a lot of armor, both of which she needs.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives a full disable as well as a larger mana pool.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque allows Krobelus to stay in team-fights near indefinitely when paired with Shiva's Guard.<br/><br/>Black King Bar gives a boost to HP as well as the ability to get in the middle of team fights, giving Exorcism the most damage potential.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a great pick up because Crypt Swarm allows Death Prophet to flash farm, allowing her to build the Mekansm quickly, and her high Intelligence gain makes casting not too taxing on her effectiveness in team fights. Headdress and Buckler are also nice early game items to have to make her more survivable.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a notable pick up because of the health regeneration as well as the spell shield, and when paired with Mekansm, Krobelus can potentially turn around a losing fight, or create a strong initiation.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel allow global presence as well as a more reliable escape than Phase Boots.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is an amazing item on Krobelus because it gives movement speed, mana, and a way to disable an enemy or herself. When paired with Exorcism, Krobelus can be kept out of combat while her spirits do massive damage to enemies. Also, this item should be built when Bloodstone is no longer viable.<br/><br/>Octarine Core in many cases can replace Bloodstone as it will give Krobelus enough intelligence and mana to sustain throughout multiple fights. Although Exorcism does physical damage, it still provides spell lifesteal, allowing Krobelus to survive through her Exorcism more reliably until her spirits heal her. But the most valuable component to Krobelus is the cooldown reduction, as the high cooldown Exorcism makes up the vast majority of her utility in fights and pushes.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage makes Exorcism do a lot more damage to a single target, as well as provide more mana regeneration and armor when not active, both of which Death Prophet needs.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is fairly easy for Death Prophet to farm because of Crypt Swarm being a fast farming tool, and her ability to take towers in seconds with Exorcism. Assault Cuirass gives a lot of armor and attack speed to herself and her team, as well as reducing the enemy's armor, allowing Exorcism to do even more damage in engagements and pushes.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Disruptor is a strong teamfight hero who can control the enemy team's positioning with his potent disables. His Kinetic Field can prevent enemies from leaving the area after being set up, and when used in conjunction with Static Storm can silence and disrupt enemies for extended periods. While he lacks nuking power, he can influence the battlefield in such a way as to greatly hinder the enemy in engagements and prevent gank targets from escaping with Glimpse.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great at catching and ganking heroes.<br/><br/>Strong team fight spells.<br/><br/>Relatively item independent.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Poor stats growth.<br/><br/>Mediocre nuke spell.<br/><br/>Needs good timing to get skills off.<br/><br/>He's useless when enemy is magic immune.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Generally Disruptor is played as a hard support, as he does not require farm in order to perform well. As well, he can be a powerful roamer as his spells can influence enemy positioning, setting up kills for teammates if they have strong damage output.<br/><br/>One of Disruptor's biggest strengths is his extremely short cast animation, which combined with the long cast range on his spells can make him a force to be reckoned with. Positioning is very important for Disruptor, as exploiting these two aspects of the hero allows him to have a very powerful impact on any engagement.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Thunder Strike</h4>Thunder Strike is a damage-over-time magic nuke that reveals the target's location for the duration of the spell.<br/><br/>The damage that Thunder Strike deals is minuscule in the early game, and lacks immediate killing power even when maxed out. However, it also provides vision of the target for its duration, so long as the target is not invisible. This can be very useful for preventing them from juking, as well as giving vision of them to target them with Glimpse.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Thunder Strike will deal nuke damage to all enemies within a small radius around the target as well. If using the spell to nuke creep waves or neutral camps, it is best to cast it on a melee creep, as they will clump up near other melee creeps while attacking, resulting in all of them taking the damage.<br/><br/>Thunder Strike can be a powerful counter to Blink Dagger if it can be cast before the enemy reacts. By taking advantage of Thunder Strike's long cast range, it can prevent enemies from using their Blink Dagger for at least 9 seconds. (6 seconds for the duration of Thunder Strike, and 3 more for the cooldown) This can be used either to stop initiators from jumping on top of your team for a time, or prevent gank targets from easily escaping.<br/><h4>Glimpse</h4>Glimpse is one of Disruptor's most potent disables, as it can forcibly re-position an enemy, putting them in a location that your team can capitalize on.<br/><br/>Glimpse can be extremely tricky to use, as the enemy's previous movements must be taken into account in order to maximize its effect. As such, timing is extremely important as casting it too early or too late can move a target only a small distance, or put them in a location of safety.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Glimpse has a relatively short cast range at early levels, and its long cooldown means that it can only be used once in an engagement. However, maxing the spell out allows Disruptor to cast it on any hero within visual range, and its cooldown shortens to the point where it can be cast up to twice in fights. Maxing out Glimpse early on can provide strong benefits for Disruptor's team due to this greatly enhanced utility.<br/><br/>Thunder Strike is a very powerful spell to use in combination with Glimpse, as it provides vision of the target, ensuring that Glimpse can be cast on them so long as they are within its cast range.<br/><br/>In tandem with the above, Thunder Strike's damage interval can be used to assist with the timing for casting Glimpse. Thunder Strike's third damage instance happens exactly 4 seconds after cast, so casting Glimpse on the target at the same time as that damage instance will send the target to the place where they were standing when Thunder Strike was first cast on them.<br/><br/>One very strong aspect of Glimpse is that its effects are global, and there is no maximum range on how far back it can send its target; if an enemy is teleporting in with a Town Portal Scroll, Glimpse can send them straight back to their previous location, even if it was across the map. However, keep in mind that while this can be used to prevent reinforcements against tower dives or pushes, the target will still have 1.8 seconds to act before being sent back, so they can still cast high-impact spells at their destination for a short time.<br/><br/>Glimpsed targets are issued stop commands at the end of its effect, effectively allowing it to be used to cancel channeled spells and items. Because of this, Glimpse can be used to interrupt Town Portal Scrolls by enemies attempting to escape or reinforce their allies, or halt channeled abilities such as Black Hole, Death Ward and Freezing Field.<br/><br/>If the target of a Glimpse is an illusion, it will be instantly destroyed. This can be useful for instantly removing certain illusions from the field, such as Replicate, Haunt and so on.<br/><br/>Glimpse can re-position even hidden or invulnerable targets, with certain exceptions. This makes it a powerful spell against certain evasive heroes, as it can return heroes through abilities like Phase Shift, Ball Lightning and Waveform.<br/><br/>While Glimpse cannot return targets to their previous location through spell immunity, it can be a powerful spell for forcing the enemy to activate Black King Bar. By catching them with Glimpse, the enemy can be forced to activate their BKB at an inopportune time or be killed. Even if the kill is missed, this can reduce its maximum duration, or put it on cooldown ahead of a major engagement.<br/><h4>Kinetic Field</h4>Kinetic Field is a powerful movement inhibitor that, used properly, can lock down multiple enemy heroes for a short duration, allowing them to be easily brought down by allied nukes.<br/><br/>Glimpse is the perfect combo spell to set up Kinetic Field with. As Glimpse will mark the target's arrival destination upon cast, Kinetic Field can be cast upon that position to ensure that the target is locked inside after being pulled back.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Kinetic Field has a 1.2 second delay before the barrier forms, so it is possible for enemies with good movement speed or quick reaction times to escape capture. In order to prevent this, a leading disable is extremely helpful as it can immobilize a target long enough for the field to materialize.<br/><br/>In teamfights, Kinetic Field can split the battlefield and foil the enemy's attempts to get in position to cast their spells. Even if no actual enemy players are caught within, stopping rear-line supports from joining the fight can make a significant difference. Try to use the terrain to your advantage, such as chokepoints and cliffs.<br/><br/>Kinetic Field provides ground vision within the barrier for the duration of the spell. As such, it can be used to reveal the fog of war, such as up high ground or behind trees.<br/><br/>While enemies can cast re-positioning spells to escape the barrier, Force Staff cannot be used to break out (though enemies can still be pushed in). This makes Kinetic Field unique among lockdown spells, as the enemy will have fewer options for escaping the field. As well, while spell immunity will allow enemies to simply walk through the walls, the spell will directly manipulate their movement speed rather than act as an obstacle, meaning that spells such as Duel can be foiled by preventing melee targets from passing through.<br/><h4>Static Storm</h4>Static Storm is an extremely powerful area disable that, if it catches more than one important enemy caster, can turn the battlefield in your favor if they are prevented from escaping its clutches.<br/><br/>Static Storm is best combined with Kinetic Field, as the combination creates a null area where enemies are silenced and cannot escape, making them easy prey for your teammates.<br/><br/>Due to its relatively short cooldown for an ultimate ability, Static Storm can be used tactically for single kills when combined with Glimpse and Kinetic Field. Early game engagements usually do not happen with high frequency, and the spell's cooldown decreases as it is leveled up.<br/><br/>Like Kinetic Field, Static Storm can be used to split the battlefield by preventing members of the opposing team from participating. Placing the storm over an area that the enemy must traverse through will render them helpless as they try to pass through, and can be further punished with Kinetic Field if they attempt to do so, trapping them within. As well, combining the spell's long cast range and short cast animation allows Disruptor to drop the cloud on already-casting enemies, potentially interrupting any channeling spells in the process.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that, without any additional lockdown, Static Storm is not a very strong disabling spell as enemies can simply walk outside of the storm if they are not otherwise hindered, and Kinetic Field takes time to form. If allies can initiate with large area disables like Reverse Polarity or Vacuum, Static Storm can potentially disable entire teams and render them helpless.<br/><br/>Static Storm becomes an extremely deadly spell when upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, as it gains the ability to mute enemies caught within. While it is still blocked by spell immunity, if used on the right targets at the right time, it can prevent Black King Bar from being activated, rendering its targets completely impotent.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and a Healing Salve give health sustain so that you can last longer in lane without going back to base.<br/><br/>Clarity will allow Disruptor to maintain his mana pool in the laning stage. His mediocre base intelligence and static mana costs mean that casting spells in the early game will cost a disproportionately large amount of mana, so keeping it topped up in the early game can allow you to set up kills for your team more easily.<br/><br/>Two Iron Branch are cheap and can boost Disruptor's low base stats, as well as build into either a Magic Wand or Mekansm components.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should always be purchased at the start of a match by the supports. As Disruptor can be strong without early items, purchasing the courier should take priority.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed is important to get early on for Disruptor. Not only does it allow him to escape pursuing enemies more easily, the extra movement speed allows him to close in to cast Glimpse more reliably, as at early levels it has a low cast range.<br/><br/>Magic Stick provides burst health and mana regen, important on any low-HP support who needs to regularly cast spells. A fully-charged Magic Stick allows Disruptor to cast any of his non-ultimate spells one more time even if he is completely out of mana.<br/><br/>A Bracer is a cheap purchase that provides Disruptor with useful stats, especially to his strength, giving him more HP.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots is a strong boots upgrade for Disruptor, as his mediocre base intelligence and intelligence growth mean that his mana pool is not very strong until very late in the game. Increasing the size of his mana pool and giving him a way to replenish his mana allows him to always have the mana to cast what he needs, while the extra movement speed helps with positioning.<br/><br/>Magic Wand is a good cheap upgrade to Magic Stick that provides all-around stats and increased charge storage. Both are necessary if playing as a hard support.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a strong item to have in any teamfight. Besides the burst area heal for teammates, the item provides all-around stats as well as armor, increasing Disruptor's survivability.<br/><br/>Observer Ward are crucial to have for any team, as they provide map vision and allow coordinated teams to make use of knowledge of the enemies' movements. Disruptor can greatly benefit from having vision over enemies, as Glimpse has an extremely long cast range at maximum level.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should always be carried no matter what hero is played. For Disruptor, being able to teleport to a gank or fight is extremely important as his powerful spells can turn engagements completely around.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a good all-around item to pick up on low-farm supports like Disruptor. It is easier to build than Blink Dagger, and can be used to re-position himself, allies or enemies. The extra intelligence also gives Disruptor a bigger mana pool to work with.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter allows Static Storm to mute enemies, meaning that they cannot cast spells or use items, such as Black King Bar, as long as they are within its area of influence. Used properly, Disruptor can completely turn a fight to his team's advantage if he can catch the enemy unaware.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is very strong on Disruptor, as his minuscule cast animation allows him to cast his disables before most enemies are able to react. Blink Dagger allows him to close the distance instantly, giving the enemy even less chance to react.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Disruptor many powerful benefits. Besides the bigger mana pool and armor, the aura can hinder enemy physical attacks by reducing their attack speed, and the active can slow enemies' movement speed, which can make it easier to pen them in with Kinetic Field.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a strong teamfight item that gives Disruptor survivability against magic nukes, increasing his survivability if enemy casters try to remove him from the field at the start of a fight. The active allows Disruptor to protect his team against magic nukes, giving them another edge in teamfights.<br/><br/>Necronomicon gives Disruptor useful stats, and allows him to contribute more to fights by summoning minions to deal more damage to the enemy. At level 3, the Necronomicon Warrior provides True Sight, which can be extremely useful for providing vision over invisible enemy heroes so that disables can be targeted on them.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord gives Disruptor good all-around stats and additional armor. The active can increase the potency of Static Storm, and weakens enemies trapped by Kinetic Field for any teammates with powerful magic nukes.<br/><br/>Flying Courier is an important team item that should be bought by a support as soon as possible.<br/><br/>As a support, Disruptor can benefit from buying many useful items for his team.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards are very powerful on Disruptor, as he is a ranged hero who possesses a vision spell. By using Kinetic Field on ward spots after placing a Sentry Ward, he can spot any enemy Observer Wards and destroy them with ease.<br/><br/>Dust of Appearance should be regularly carried if enemies have invisibility spells that they can use to escape. In Disruptor's case, being able to spot invisible enemies allows him to target them with Glimpse, followed by Kinetic Field.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good utility item that gives Disruptor more flexibility and overall team contribution, as well as augmenting his ganking prowess. The item itself provides the same amount of strength as a Bracer, and a small amount of mana regen that helps maintain his mana pool. The active can be used to add more damage to a gank, or to heal teammates.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are a cheap upgrade to Boots of Speed that provide Disruptor with survivability and mobility, useful for any hard support. The increased armor and passive HP regen can ensure that Disruptor is almost always at full health, and increases his survivability against physical attacks. The increased movement speed allows him to position for casting spells more easily, allowing him to gank more effectively.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a helpful utility item. Besides giving Disruptor more armor and mana regen, the active can be used to reduce the armor of gank targets, making them easier to focus down after pinning them down with Glimpse and Kinetic Field, or can give an ally increased armor in a fight. It can also be targeted on Roshan to make claiming the Aegis of the Immortal easier.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape has strong utility and increases Disruptor's flexibility. The active can be used to allow Disruptor to get closer to initiate on enemies, and allows him to provide the same benefit to allied initiators. It can also be used to protect teammates who are caught out of position, giving them tremendous resistance to magic nukes and allowing them to escape more easily if the enemy has no detection.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives Disruptor many strong benefits, offensively and defensively. The item improves his mana pool and gives him strong mana regen, while the movement speed increases his mobility, allowing him to position for his spells more easily. The active can be used on himself to dispel debuffs such as silences, or on enemies to immobilize them prior to casting Kinetic Field.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos improves Disruptor's survivability and gives him more mana for casting his spells. The active's long cast range allows him to place a soft disable on enemies from a great distance, which can be followed up with Kinetic Field to further limit their movements. The low cooldown on Cripple and Kinetic Field allows Disruptor to use this combination on a very low turnaround time.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides Disruptor with a hard disable, something he otherwise lacks. Besides the overall attribute improvement and significantly buffed casting ability, using Hex on a target will cut their movement speed down to almost the minimum while at the same time silencing and muting them, making it a good leading disable prior to using Kinetic Field and Static Storm.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves are a logical upgrade to already-purchased Arcane Boots and Mekansm, and provides Disruptor with additional teamfight contribution. The active restores both mana and HP at the same time, and can be used to purge debuffs off of Disruptor that may be hindering him from contributing to teamfights.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Enchantress is a very flexible Intelligence hero that can be a effective jungle hero with focus in ganking and pushing in early stages of the game. Her Enchant allows her to control neutral creeps, allowing her to use their abilities and gain benefits from their auras. She can heal herself and her allies with Nature's Attendants along with dealing true damage with her auto attacks through Impetus.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals pure damage.<br/><br/>Fast movement speed.<br/><br/>Fairly resistant to melee enemies.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very susceptible to burst damage.<br/><br/>Extremely low health points.<br/><br/>Easily countered by Black King Bar.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Enchantress is effective in all stages of the game.<br/><br/>Building Force Staff is a very good choice on Enchantress; as aside from the intelligence it gives her it can be used to put some distance between her and her enemy (thus empowering Impetus); or even if very well-timed to use it on Impetus' target while Impetus itself is mid-air; thus hugely increasing its damage. Note however that this will make escaping easier for the enemy if your very powerful Impetus does not kill them.<br/>Also a teamwork and combo with an allied Pudge's Meat Hook can also maximize your Impetus to its full damage when also combined with Force Staff.<br/><br/><br/>Enchant allows the Enchantress to micromanage just like Chen. Micromanaging is a crucial ability to master for heroes like Enchantress and Chen.<br/><br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, Enchantress has a higher attack range than towers, allowing her to attack them without them being able to attack back.<br/><br/>Power Treads and Urn of Shadows are highly recommended for Enchantress.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Untouchable</h4>Untouchable makes Enchantress nearly immune to basic attacks, but be careful, she still has a low health pool and can be easily focused down by spells.<br/><br/>A few levels invested into Untouchable will slow Roshan's attacks to a crawl, making Enchantress an ideal tank against Roshan.<br/><h4>Enchant</h4>With an Octarine Core, Enchantress can have up to 8 units enchanted with Enchant at a time.<br/><br/>Try to get Alpha Wolf in late game as its damage aura scales with your allies' attack damage.<br/><h4>Nature's Attendants</h4>A Soul Ring can be useful for Enchantress; its active ability provides most or all of the mana needed for Nature's Attendants, allowing her to heal effectively 250/450/650/850 health for effectively 0/0/5/20 mana. The ring can later be built into a Bloodstone.<br/><br/>Her heal is very powerful in surviving ganks, as it can be used before getting stunned and if she's the only target, only heavy nukers are capable of killing her.<br/><h4>Impetus</h4>Buying Mana Regeneration Items like Orchid Malevolence, Scythe of Vyse, and Bloodstone are helpful for Enchantress since Impetus burns a lot of mana, even if you have a lot of mana regeneration.<br/><br/>The attack range increases of Dragon Lance fully stack with that of her Aghanim's Scepter upgrade, increasing her attack range to a total of 870. Looking at how Impetus deals damage, this is a significant boost to her damage output. The item also gives strength and attack speed, both of which are needed attributes for Enchantress.<br/>Impetus deals 82.5/110/137.5 damage per attack, considering attacking a stationary target at max attack range. Dragon Lance increases that to 102/136/170, Aghanim's Scepter to 111/148/185, and both together to 130.5/174/217.5 damage.<br/><br/><br/>Remember that Impetus scales very well into late game, especially with attack speed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango heals every little wound that you could get from jungling or gank attempts.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength is bought for two reasons: Enchantress greatest weakness is her low starting strength and strength gain. So the Gauntlets of Strength mitigates this weakness a bit. They also build into an Urn of Shadows, which is a very useful item for Enchantress.<br/><br/>Healing Salve is bought to recover from a greater clash, which could potentially happen while ganking or in the jungle when meeting a roaming hero.<br/><br/>Iron Branches give very cost effective and cheap attribute bonuses.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early-game items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is good for refilling health and mana in short bursts.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads increases the rate at which Impetus can be used and can also provide a health bonus.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a useful item for a hero who will be very active in the early game.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is the prime way to increase Enchantress' damage output. It also increases her attack range, allowing her to stay farther from the fray.<br/><br/>Dragon Lance Enchantress can throw out very painful Impetus attacks when combined with Aghanim's Scepter, reaching more than 800 attack range. The strength, damage and attack speed bonus are great for her as well, as she is lacking all of that.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Helm of the Dominator is a nice pickup for Enchantress, giving her some cheap stats. Its aura also provides attack speed and health regen for her and her controlled creeps. Furthermore it enables Enchantress to control another creep with its "Dominate" ability to increase her army in combination with Enchant.<br/><br/>Bloodstone helps with mana regeneration, allowing more liberal use of Impetus, and it also gives good survivability.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Intelligence, survivability, and a slow, allowing Enchantress to keep in range of her targets.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides good bonuses to attributes and provides an important disable that allows Enchantress to keep using Impetus on a target.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence helps to pick off a single target who poses a threat to Enchantress and also gives intelligence, mana regeneration and attack speed, greatly increasing the rate at which Impetus can be used.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque, combined with Untouchable, makes Enchantress very hard to dispatch.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass allows Enchantress to attack faster with Impetus, and survive for longer in fights.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a great help to positioning.<br/><br/>Hurricane Pike is an optimal item choice for Enchantress, as it enables her to deal tremendous damage in a short time while keeping herself in a safe distance. It is also built from a Dragon Lance and Force Staff which are also recommended items for Enchantress.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Enigma is a tactical spellcaster who is known for his incredibly powerful ultimate, Black Hole. Playing him well requires efficient farming, control of Demonic Conversion and good positioning to get the most mileage out of his gravitational abilities. A well-played Enigma can singlehandedly win a teamfight and possibly determine the outcome of a match by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the most efficient junglers in the game.<br/><br/>Strong pushing and team fight capabilities.<br/><br/>Possesses early game ganking potential with Malefice and Eidolon damage.<br/><br/>Black Hole is one of the strongest team fight spells in the game.<br/><br/>Has two large area-of-effect spells that bypasses spell immunity and deals Pure damage.<br/><br/>Entry level hero for players who want to hone their micromanagement skills.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Rather lengthy cooldowns for all of his spells<br/><br/>Very long cooldown on his ultimate, Black Hole.<br/><br/>Black Hole is a channeled ability with short range, thus making him vulnerable to long range disables, silences, or other hazards.<br/><br/>Not naturally tanky.<br/><br/>Most certainly will be in the jungle nearly every game, making him prone to ganks.<br/><br/>Poor management of his Eidolons can give his opponents an edge in their farming.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Enigma works best with allied heroes that have strong AoE capabilities, such as Warlock, Magnus or Queen of Pain.<br/><br/>Enigma can kill Roshan before the 10-minute mark, with the help of Level 3 or 4 Eidolons. For acquiring them, use Demonic Conversion on either a neutral creep if he's on the Radiant side, or a lane creep if he's on the Dire side. An item commonly picked up is a Medallion of Courage, as it allows him to reduce Roshan's armor for a higher damage output. Begin the fight by tanking Roshan yourself, until your Eidolons have multiplied; let the Eidolons take over and apply a Healing Salve. Try to micro the Eidolons to distribute the damage that Roshan does to them. Re-cast Demonic Conversion on one of the Eidolons before they expire and repeat the process (tank, heal up, nuke). If executed properly, Roshan will fall within about one minute.<br/><br/>Enigma's large mana consumption means that Arcane Boots can be an effective boots upgrade. If the player chooses to ignore upgrading boots, Boots of Travel may be taken later on to take advantage of his pushing power.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is a powerful tool when used with Black Hole.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade is a viable alternative to Blink Dagger, if enemies do not have detection.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a great substitute for Blink Dagger, offering some Intelligence.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos also works on Enigma as it helps with both his mana and health.<br/><br/>Blade Mail discourages Heroes outside of your Black Hole from attacking you. Ghost Scepter can be used to a similar effect.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows may also prove to be a useful item on a team with hardcore gankers as the mana regeneration and strength boost really helps him out early in the game.<br/><br/>Enigma can get Mekansm and Pipe of Insight quickly thanks to his jungling ability.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere, as an alternative to Black King Bar, is a good item when up against Heroes with single-target disables that go through spell immunity such as Vengeful Spirit.<br/><br/>One of the deadliest combos executed with Black Hole is Sand king's Epicenter. Locking all heroes in allows Sand King to channel it safely, while also making sure the pulses hit 95% of the time, dealing extraordinary damage. Even more so if used in conjunction with Veil of Discord.<br/><br/>Due to it pulling enemies closer together, Enigma synergizes particularly well with heroes with strong but small AoE damage, be it physical (i.e. Sven with his cleave), or otherwise (i.e. Leshrac with Pulse Nova).<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Malefice</h4>Enigma's presence in encounters is greatly diminished while Black Hole is on cooldown, but he can make himself useful by saving Malefice for a crucial moment and also sneaking around to use Midnight Pulse within an area the enemies may try to escape through. A good combo is to use Malefice on an enemy walking through Midnight Pulse or any allied AoE damaging spell.<br/><br/>Malefice can prove to be surprisingly detrimental to opponents with slow attack speed, such as siege units and Warlock's Golem, as the periodic stun will reset their attack animation and prevent their attacks from connecting with their intended targets.<br/>Roshan in particular is hampered by this spell greatly, as this not only prevents him from performing basic attacks, but also greatly reduce the chances of him bashing.<br/><br/><br/>Take note that Malefice acts as a debuff that can be dispelled easily with any basic dispel.<br/>Although Malefice can easily be dispelled, the first stun will always occur so long as the spell hits the target. The subsequent stuns/damage instances may not be important if the primary purpose of the spell is to disrupt channeling abilities.<br/><br/><h4>Demonic Conversion</h4>At a 170 mana per cast, Demonic Conversion is a very costly spell during the early game. It is generally a good idea to withhold casting it during the laning phase until the skill is at level 3 or 4 when the eidolons deal better damage.<br/><br/>Eidolons have an innate 50% spell resistance, but have very low maximum health, even when the skill is fully maxed. With their high gold bounty, they are prime targets for farmers, and care should be taken to ensure that they are not recklessly sacrificed.<br/>While they have rather low health, they deal very high damage, especially when you've manage to amass six of them after splitting. Coupled with items such as Vladmir's Offering and Necronomicon's summons, and they are a force to be reckoned with.<br/>In sufficient number, Eidolons can be used effectively in encounters, as en masse their collective attack does significant damage. If you die in an encounter and you have Eidolons still alive, use them to boost your team's damage a little.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Demonic Conversion is one of the few abilities that can instantly destroy siege units. Keep this in mind whenever your tower is under attack by them.<br/><br/>Keeping Eidolons around you is a very good idea when there is a Pudge or Mirana on the enemy team, as it makes you very difficult to be hooked or arrowed, which is important considering that Enigma is very easy prey for kills in the early game.<br/><br/>When jungling, max Demonic Conversion to beef up your Eidolons and increase their damage. Also, micro your Eidolons to make sure none of the initial three Eidolons die to jungle creeps so that all of them can multiply. This increases jungling speed significantly. Do not be afraid to tank for your Eidolons either when clearing the big camps.<br/>Eidolons will always split and fully heal upon firing their 7th shot. Careful micro-management is key whenever you are using them for jungling or tower-pushing.<br/><br/><h4>Midnight Pulse</h4>Investing one point in Midnight Pulse for early game utility is usually enough, as Enigma does not have a rather large mana pool early game, and that mana could be better spent on creating Eidolons for his time in the jungle or to have some sort of immediate stun for his enemies using Malefice.<br/><br/>Using Midnight Pulse before Black Hole is often a good idea to boost the damage done. However, you must use this at your discretion because there might not be a time to use it or it can make you miss out on crucial Black Holes.<br/><br/>Like Black Hole, Midnight Pulse deals pure damage and bypasses spell immunity. This means heroes who use Black King Bar will still take the full effect of the spell if they do not leave the area of effect. When not comboing with Black Hole, Midnight Pulse can be used to hold off important chokepoints such as tier 3 towers or Roshan from opposing heroes.<br/><h4>Black Hole</h4>Black Hole is a very powerful disable that bypasses the spell-immunity granted by Black King Bar. Lasting for 4 seconds, a successful cast will almost guarantee a team-wipe, especially if he's paired up with a Hero like Jakiro or Sven.<br/><br/>Black Hole is a channeling spell, and care and consideration should be kept in mind when looking at the opponent's Hero lineup. You may need to invest in a Black King Bar or Linken's Sphere to minimise the odds of getting interrupted.<br/><br/>Beware of Rubick as he can counter you very well. While you are channeling Black Hole, you are also very prone to having it stolen or interrupted. While spell immunity prevents most interruption, Rubick's Spell Steal is unaffected by it, and he can potentially ruin your initiation with the Black Hole of his own. Linken's Sphere could be bought to prevent Spell Steal, however, keep in mind that Rubick has two other single-target abilities, and possibly a couple of single-target items as well.<br/>Shadow Blade may also be bought to avoid all of Rubick's spells if used during Black Hole's channeling. But keep in mind that invisibility is very easily countered by detection items, and if you lack a Black King Bar, his Telekinesis' stun could be used to interrupt you instead.<br/><br/><br/>It is always a good idea to refresh your Black Hole immediately after casting, as a teamfight can happen anytime, anywhere. Although, depending on the situation, it is also equally wise to save Refresher Orb for next cast, as a double Black Hole can be very devastating to the enemy team, provided it is executed properly.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Enigma needs lots of Clarity potions early in the game to farm the jungle consistently.<br/><br/>Tango is useful when you are out of mana and Clarities.<br/><br/>Enigma does not need many items to jungle efficiently at level 1, so he can afford to buy the Animal Courier.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Stick helps in the jungle since it gains charges from neutral creeps casting their abilities.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives mana regeneration and armor for Enigma and his Eidolons, and can be later built into a Vladmir's Offering if you are going for a pusher role.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is a great source of mana, allowing him to use his Demonic Conversion as often as possible. Enigma does not often go close to enemies since his abilities and his Eidolons have a relatively reliable range.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed help you getting into position to use Black Hole.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a cost effective upgrade from Magic Stick.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots give high health regeneration in early levels, which can be used in between creep farming in the jungle, or during since Enigma has his Eidolons to tank for him. The high speed also enables Enigma to roam quickly in search for other creep camps, or to help gank.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger helps your positioning greatly and helps to pull off a good Black Hole.<br/><br/>Bracer is an inexpensive item that gives you more durability while you are channeling Black Hole.<br/><br/>Aether Lens grants him additional range, allowing him to land his ultimate perhaps at much quicker speed without having to walk toward the team, and also to keep him out of harm's way if there is a nearby enemy that is not caught by his ultimate.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Mekansm is highly recommended, as Enigma can farm very quickly in the early stages of the game, is relatively item independent, and has a large mana pool, all of which are traits of a strong Mekansm carrier. The added armor, health regen, and active heal can also aid Enigma's Eidolons, and is very effective and needed to buff or remedy hurt allies in teamfights.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is essential if the enemy team can easily interrupt your Black Hole, although you must keep in mind if the offending abilities are blocked by spell immunity.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb gives Enigma high health and mana regen. The active is also very useful, which can be used either in case the first Black Hole failed, or another teamfight broke out sooner than expected.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly increases the effectiveness of Enigma's Black Hole, as well as much needed stats to remedy his health and mana pools.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides an intense increase to mana regeneration, and adds a much needed secondary disable that does not have a casting delay.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard also gives Enigma some mana management bonuses, and its active ability synergizes well with Black Hole.<br/><br/>Radiance synergizes well with his damage over time spells like Midnight Pulse or Black Hole. It also helps him to earn gold faster.<br/><br/>And if no one else is planning to, or Enigma is the least item dependent Hero in the team, buying a Flying Courier benefits the team greatly.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves allows a slot to be freed, provides a steady supply of health and mana regeneration to the team, and increases Enigma's survivability.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is an alternative to Black King Bar for when the enemy team has disables that ignore spell immunity, such as Primal Roar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Invoker is one of the most difficult to learn heroes in the game, but also one of the most flexible and powerful casters. As such, his skill floor is not impossibly high, however, his skill ceiling is almost unparalleled, and thus he takes significant amounts of practice in order to learn. Because of his need for quick levels and gold, he is usually played as a mid hero. Due to Invoker's heavy level requirement in order to be effective, it is generally advised to focus on leveling two orbs and getting a value point in the third, rather than trying to level all three equally. While Invoker can be more flexible if he can cast strong spells in all categories, the lack of specialization also limits his potency in areas where his team might need him to be strong. Invoker can only truly reach his full strength at level 25, and as such he needs to be able to effectively contribute to teamfights before reaching that point.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Extremely versatile.<br/><br/>Numerous disables.<br/><br/>Deadly magic combos.<br/><br/>Can push quite well.<br/><br/>Good solo killing ability with Quas-Exort.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Steep learning curve.<br/><br/>Requires significant early farm to be effective.<br/><br/>Not very good at farming compared to other cores.<br/><br/>Vulnerable to silence.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Quas Exort Invoker needs lots of farm. Getting an early Boots of Travel to get faster around the map and kill creeps is always a good thing. Usually followed by Drums of Endurance, Blink Dagger or Force Staff and Aghanims Scepter.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Quas</h4>Active Quas orbs gives health regeneration, which is especially useful for staying in lane.<br/><br/>Often the last orb to be maxed as it doesn't provide much for Invoker other than health regen.<br/><h4>Wex</h4>Active Wex orbs increase Invoker's attack speed, and more importantly movement speed which can be useful for chasing down enemies.<br/><h4>Exort</h4>Active Exort orbs gives damage, therefore players often level up Exort first to make last-hitting easier in lane.<br/><h4>Invoke</h4>Invoke is a powerful spell which allows Invoker to forge spells in a short duration of 6 second and at higher levels, possessing Aghanim's Scepter gives the advantage of invoking spells in a time span of 2 seconds.<br/><br/>Whenever a new spell is Invoked, the oldest of his two currently Invoked spells is removed from selection. Beware of which spell combinations you wish to execute, and queue them through Invoke accordingly.<br/><br/>The above can be facilitated more easily by switching the spell orders as needed. If the oldest currently Invoked spell is Invoked, it will swap positions with the newest one without putting Invoke on cooldown, allowing Invoker to immediately queue another spell for Invoke. This can be crucial for quickly ordering spell combinations if a required spell for that combo is already the oldest Invoked spell.<br/><br/>Careful not invoke a spell that's still on cooldown, as this will waste Invoke's cooldown. Since the ability icon disappears after being replaced, players will have to rely on instinct and experience to know whether or not a spell is on cooldown.<br/><br/>If you want to cast three spells in quick succession, it can help to have the orbs for the third spell prepared before casting the other two. This allows you to cast your first two spells and then Invoke the third immediately once the oldest Invoked spell is on cooldown. This can let you cast nuke-heavy combos such as Sun Strike + Chaos Meteor + Deafening Blast, as the first two spells have delays that allow you to queue up the third so that you can land all three on a target simultaneously.<br/><br/>With an Aghanim's Scepter, it is possible to Invoke spells every two seconds. If your reflexes are good enough, you can barrage the enemy with spells as quickly as you can queue them up. However, this is only truly useful in the late-game once all of your orbs have been leveled up enough for their associated spells to be truly potent.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Tangos are bought to stay longer in lane, since they give good health regeneration for a low price.<br/><br/>Null Talisman is recommended as it increase Invoker's overall stats, particularly his attack damage so that he can last-hit more easily. It should generally be sold once bigger items are needed, as it does not build into anything useful for Invoker.<br/><br/>Faerie Fire is often bought to increase his starting damage for lasthitting, and to consume in an early fight, potentially avoiding death for a low cost.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are important to get quickly, as Invoker has one of the lowest base movement speeds in the game. Getting a movement speed advantage over your opponent allows you to position yourself for casting your spells more easily.<br/><br/>Magic Stick provides Invoker with additional mana and health with its charges, which is important on any frail caster. Using the charges can give Invoker enough health to survive an attempted gank, or allow him to cast one more spell to ensure a kill.<br/><br/>Bracer gives Invoker more stats, particularly strength for increasing his survivability. It also builds into a Drum of Endurance.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives Invoker the much needed mana regeneration to stay in lane and cast spells after nerfs to his mana and mana regen.<br/><br/>Ring of Aquila gives solid stats for only one item slot.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots are the best boots for Quas-Wex Invoker, as the speed boost offsets his low base movement speed. Additionally, the bonus damage makes last-hitting easier, important on Invoker since he requires lots of gold in order to be effective.<br/><br/>Power Treads are the best boots for Quas-Exort Invoker (along with Boots of Travel), as they give him stats and attack speed, making last hitting easier.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance further increases Invoker's attack and movement speed, and provides him with extra attributes and damage.<br/><br/>Magic Wand gives Invoker stats and larger charge storage when upgraded from Magic Stick. A full charge Wand can allow Invoker to cast any of his spells so long as he has the mana to Invoke it first.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter drastically reduces the cooldown time for Invoke, removes the mana cost for queuing spells, and increases the maximum possible level of each of his orbs by one while also providing him with an additional level in each. It increases Invoker's effectiveness across the board by making all of his spells more potent and allowing him to bring many more spells to bear in fights through Invoke's reduced cooldown.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should be carried by all heroes all the time. In Invoker's case, his ability to bombard the enemy with his spells makes him a powerful ally to have in any fight.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Hand of Midas should be picked up if Invoker had a good early game, especially with Quas-Exort build. It increases his experience gain which is incredibly important for Invoker.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is a useful item, allowing Invoker to split push and farm with Forge Spirits, and teleport to team fights. It also gives him lots of movement speed.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives good attributes and plenty of mana and mana regeneration, increasing Invoker's survivability while also giving him the mana he needs to cast his spells. Hex is also one of the strongest hard-disables in the game that can completely turn teamfights around.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a very useful item. Its active ability can be used to escape, to chase enemies or to save teammates from sure death, as well as re-position yourself for your spells. As well, it provides Invoker with more intelligence and health regen, allowing him to cast spells more easily.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a very strong item to build on Invoker, as he requires good positioning in order to make the most of his spells. Its mobility greatly increases his offensive potential as well as survivability.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a great utility item, as it gives Invoker many powerful benefits for a cost-effective price. It increases his intelligence and gives him powerful scaling mana regen, allowing him to cast spells more frequently, and the increased base movement speed offsets his low mobility, making positioning for spells much easier. The Cyclone is also a very powerful disable and is often used to set up difficult-to-land spells such as Sun Strike, Chaos Meteor, EMP, and so on.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is a good item to build on Invoker if you're constantly being focused or disabled by the enemy. The spell immunity allows you to stand on the front lines to cast your spells without being interrupted.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb turns Invoker into an unstoppable nuker. Two back to back spell combos will kill just about any hero.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is extremely strong on cast-heavy nukers, and can make Invoker a force to be reckoned with. The item grants a tremendous amount of health and mana, reduces the cooldowns on all of his spells as well as Invoke, and allows him to lifesteal from his nukes, making him much harder to bring down in fights.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Jakiro is a tanky intelligence hero with low cooldown damage over time spells and high amounts of magic damage. He offers a large amount of teamfight with Ice Path and Macropyre ,and push with Dual Breath and Liquid Fire<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Tanky lane support.<br/><br/>Fast and efficient lane pusher/tower sieger.<br/><br/>Low cooldown disables.<br/><br/>Large AoE control.<br/><br/>Not item-dependent.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily avoidable spells with longer cast times.<br/><br/>Fairly slow.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Jakiro has a slower turn rate than most other Heroes. Coupled with his long cast and attack animations, it makes it difficult for him to land his spells effectively when his enemies are behind him, as nimble opponents are able to see Jakiro's actions being telegraphed to them and can take the appropriate measures to either sidestep or counter them.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Dual Breath</h4>Dual Breath has an enormously long second cast backswing, so it is often worthwhile to cancel it by hitting "stop" key after Dual Breath reaches its cast point. This will allow Jakiro to cast another spell, attack, or move in rapid succession after casting Dual Breath.<br/><br/>Dual Breath deals a greater than average damage compared to other similar area of effect spells (barring ultimates), making it a very good skill for pushing lanes. Take note that the damage is dealt overtime and can be countered by high health regeneration and can be dispelled.<br/><br/>Dual Breath's casting mechanics is such that it applies a slow debuff first before the damage overtime debuff. Coupled with its long casting animation, quick-fingered opponents may be able to evade the damage overtime debuff.<br/><h4>Ice Path</h4>Ice Path will stun any enemy unit that comes in contact with it for the duration it has remaining on the battlefield. meaning that in many cases, most opponents won't be stunned for the full duration of Ice Path if it doesn't land directly on them.<br/>Ice Path makes for a good area denial spell, as it covers a large area, similar to Invoker's Ice Wall and Underlord's Pit of Malice.<br/><br/>Predicting where an enemy will go and casting Ice Path at that area right before the enemy gets there, causing the enemy walk into Ice Path, is just as effective as casting the Ice Path directly on an enemy.<br/><br/><br/>Ice Path has a fixed damage of 50, meaning that, by itself, it isn't a good source of damage. Be sure you have other spells ready to be cast right after Ice Path, or that you have other teammates to support you to maximise the effectiveness of Ice Path's utility.<br/><br/>Ice Path grants vision to the area that it is cast at, making it a good spell to check the Roshan pit.<br/><h4>Liquid Fire</h4>Liquid Fire is a great way to harass opponents during the laning stage. If nothing else, the attack speed reduction should mess with the enemy laner's ability to last hit effectively.<br/>At level 4, Liquid Fire can be applied to the same opponent continuously, as the debuff lasts for 5 seconds and spell has a cooldown of 4 seconds. It can be used to effectively keep harassers in check by hampering their attack speed almost indefinitely.<br/><br/>Liquid Fire is incredibly effective against enemies with a low natural attack speed, such as Roshan and siege creeps, as it will reduce their already slow attack rate to a crawl.<br/><br/>Liquid Fire fully affects buildings and will cause towers to suffer a reduction in their attack speed, making it a great tool for pushing.<br/><br/><br/>Liquid Fire has a greater attack range when cast manually. Use that to your advantage when you're against Heroes with a naturally greater attack range than you, or when your opponent is just out of reach of your own natural attack range.<br/>The manual cast range increase stacks with his talent and with Dragon Lance and Hurricane Pike.<br/><br/><br/>Liquid Fire is the only skill in Jakiro's arsenal that can bypass spell immunity. This makes it an effective spell to counter natural users of Black King Bar, such as Phantom Assassin and Sven as the attack speed reduction fully affects them.<br/><h4>Macropyre</h4>Like Dual Breath, Macropyre has a long cast backswing animation. Hitting the "stop" key during Macropyre's backswing animation after the cast point is reached will allow Jakiro to queue up other actions. As in the case of Dual Breath, mastering this can slightly increase Jakiro's DPS or effectiveness.<br/><br/>Macropyre has lasts for a long duration and has a relatively short cooldown, making a very good spell for area-denial.<br/>With Aghanim's Scepter's upgrade, Macropyre lasts for 30 seconds. When cast at the right intervals, it can effectively clear 2 waves of creeps and give your team a huge advantage in terms of pushing.<br/><br/><br/>Macropyre's huge coverage means that it can clear vast areas of forest very easily. Bear this in mind if you have allies or enemies that utilise trees for their abilities.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve offer cheap health regeneration during the laning phase, allowing Jakiro to stay longer in lane and get the experience he needs.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Jakiro to replenish his mana over time, allowing him to harass enemies using his spells more, with less worry of running low on mana.<br/><br/>Iron Branches increase Jakiro's overall survivability by providing additional attribute bonuses for a very cheap price.<br/><br/>Animal Courier is a good item for a support to purchase. Because of Jakiro's relatively small need for gold in the early game, he can help the team by purchasing team-related items, such as the Animal Courier or Observer Wards.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed provide a significant bonus to Jakiro's movement speed, which is essential to help catch up to fleeing heroes or escape from danger himself. They can later be upgraded into Arcane Boots to help with Jakiro's mana.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a useful item to have when the enemy team has many spell casters in the early game. Because of its active ability Energy Charge, enemies who cast many spells will quickly fill the wand with charges, offering a later burst of health and mana.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives mana regeneration and armor to Jakiro, bolstering his high mana usage and low base armor.<br/><br/>Soul Ring allows Jakiro to cast Dual Breath freely at the cost of health.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a cost effective upgrade from Magic Stick by both increasing the maximum amount of charges from Energy Charge, as well as providing additional attribute bonuses.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord's active ability Magic Weakness increases the damage enemies take from spells cast by Jakiro and his team. It also gives good attribute bonuses, costs less than Aghanim's Scepter, and benefits all of his abilities.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots are essential for Jakiro, as the additional mana pool allows him to cast his spells more frequently. The active ability Replenish Mana is also helpful to sustain Jakiro's spell usage, as well as help nearby teammates. Guardian Greaves is a natural path to upgrade to since Jakiro is commonly played as a support hero.<br/><br/>Observer Wards are useful for the team, providing sight to key areas around the map. As a support hero requiring less gold to be successful, Jakiro is a prime choice to purchase them.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is extremely useful for transportation across the map. After death, it can be used to quickly return to lane and not miss out on creep experience. After the laning phase, carrying one can prove helpful as both an escape mechanism and a quick way to help allied heroes across the map.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Mekansm is highly recommended, as Jakiro is commonly played as a support hero, and it goes hand in hand with his natural build of Arcane Boots into Guardian Greaves.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is another great item to buy as a support. If the enemy has a large amount of spell casters, it is advised that Jakiro or another allied support buy one to increase the team's overall survivability. It also provides Jakiro with a large amount of passive health regeneration, meaning he can return to base less frequently and earn more experience on the battlefield. It is advised to only carry one per team, as the damage block effects do not stack.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity provides intelligence and mana regeneration at a cost effective price, and it gives Jakiro an active ability that allows him to land his spells easier. A well-timed Ice Path to follow up will guarantee the target is stunned as they fall from the cyclone. The active can also be used on himself to dispel any debuffs or silences that happen to be placed on him.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos' long-ranged root can set up Ice Path as well as Jakiro's other abilities. The bonus mana and health also help Jakiro's survivability.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger allows Jakiro to initiate teamfights much easier, along with the added ability to travel the map quicker and offers quick escape from incoming enemies. However it is not a guaranteed escape item, as taking damage will disable the ability to blink for 3 seconds.<br/><br/>Force Staff acts more as an escape item compared to Blink Dagger, as it can be used while taking damage. It can also be used on allies if they need to chase after a kill or escape from danger themselves.<br/><br/>Aether Lens' cast range increase helps Jakiro maintain a safe distance during fights. Because almost all of his abilities affect the whole area between him and the maximum cast range, this also greatly increases the area in which enemies may be hit.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly increases the effectiveness of Jakiro's Macropyre by prolonging the duration and increasing the damage of his ultimate, as well as much needed stats to remedy his health and mana pools.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves allows a slot to be freed, provides a steady supply of health and mana regeneration to the team, and increases Jakiro's survivability.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard provides a massive increase to Jakiro's mana pool and resistance to physical attacks. The active ability Arctic Blast provides additional damage in a teamfight and slows enemies, making Jakiro's abilities easier to hit. Freezing Aura helps reduce damage from enemy carries by slowing their attack speed.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides a great disable with its active ability, Hex. It also provides a great increase in Jakiro's mana and mana regeneration, as well as all around attributes to help with his survivability.<br/><br/>Octarine Core greatly increases Jakiro's survivability by not only giving him all round health and mana boosts, but also by allowing his spells to lifesteal a portion of their damage. In addition, the cooldown reduction dramatically increases his damage and crowd control in teamfights.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Keeper of the Light is an adept support who is capable of aiding his allies and hindering his enemies with his array of spells. He can be a strong babysitter whose presence greatly augments the power of a lane, and transition into a pusher and counter-pusher past the laning stage.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Not Item dependent<br/><br/>Can give mana to team and to himself<br/><br/>High movement speed even without boots<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can die easily<br/><br/>Countered by heroes who don't need mana<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>While he has very strong counter-pushing and support spells, Ezalor is also extremely fragile, with a mere 14 base strength, the lowest in the game (tied with Medusa). As such, positioning is very important, as he needs to be close enough to cast his powerful spells yet also far enough away to be able to avoid being jumped on by the enemy.<br/><br/>Keeper of the Light is highly adept at pushing, as he can replenish teammates' and his own mana with Chakra Magic, allowing profligate use of spells, and Illuminate can severely damage if not outright kill entire creep waves. Along with his ability to re-position allies globally with Recall, Ezalor can be a force to be reckoned with at all points in the game.<br/><br/>Keeper of the Light is a very strong side-laner, able to use his spells to harass the enemy at range and support his team's spell-casting. He is in his element in the safe lane, although he can also be played in a dual off-lane to harass and threaten the enemy's safe-lane carry.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Illuminate</h4>Illuminate is a very strong channeled nuke that allows Keeper of the Light to output a large amount of damage on a very low cooldown.<br/><br/>Illuminate's strong creep-killing power makes Keeper of the Light a remarkably good farmer and counter-pusher considering his supportive role, as he can use it to either knock down large creep waves approaching a friendly tower or blast up to two neutral camps at once. As such, it is a very strong skill once maxed out, since its nuking power can allow him to farm up support items as needed.<br/><br/>However, remember that Illuminate will only deal more damage if it has been channeled for a longer duration, which is not always possible if the enemy is moving around in an attempt to avoid being an easy target. As such, it is not always wise to max out Illuminate as early as possible, since a level 2 Illuminate channeled for less than two seconds does the same amount of damage as a level 1 Illuminate channeled for the same duration, but costs more mana and requires a skill point.<br/><br/>If using Illuminate to harass or nuke an enemy player, try to cast it from the enemy's fog of war, such as behind the treeline, to give them as little warning as possible. As well, leading disables by teammates can immobilize an enemy long enough to channel the full duration of Illuminate during a gank.<br/><br/>Although Illuminate is extremely powerful for early-game pushing and harassment, it will disrupt the farm of Ezalor's lane partner if it is targeted on the entire creep wave, as it can potentially kill creeps and will push the wave closer to the enemy's tower where it is more dangerous to last-hit. If used, it should be aimed only to damage enemy heroes by targeting the wave either at an oblique angle or behind the creep wave.<br/><br/>Illuminate reveals fog of war around Ezalor while channeling, making it a useful spell for gaining vision. Remember that charging it to fulmination increases its sight range; releasing it immediately will not be good for gaining sight.<br/><h4>Mana Leak</h4>Mana Leak is an unorthodox disable that destroys the enemy's mana as they attempt to move.<br/><br/>One point in Mana Leak can be powerful in the stage, although it has a high mana cost. When setting up a kill, it is best combined with Illuminate, as Keeper of the Light can cast Mana Leak on an enemy hero, then threaten them with Illuminate damage if they do not move out of the way. However, it should not be spammed as, and only be used early on when to ganking or setting up kills.<br/><br/>Reducing the enemy's mana in-lane can make the lane safer for Keeper of the Light and his partner by preventing the enemy from going aggressive or harassing with their spells, and can set up kills as well by reducing their ability to cast escape spells and potentially stun them once they've lost all their mana. Successfully destroying enough of the enemy's mana pool can force them to leave the lane, as staying will threaten them with a stun every time Mana Leak comes off cooldown.<br/><br/>Remember that leveling up Mana Leak also improves its casting range, as well as the leak and stun duration. Taking early points can give Ezalor more teamfight and chasing potential as it can be cast on enemies from farther away, allowing it to be used from safety behind teammates or for catching fleeing enemies.<br/><br/>Because Mana Leak destroys mana as an expression of the target's maximum mana, it is disproportionately effective against heroes with large mana pools. As well, it can greatly hinder melee carries that have to move much closer to their targets to attack, resulting in increased distance moved and thus more mana destroyed.<br/><br/>While Mana Leak can severely hinder an enemy's attempts to cast spells, it does not proc if the target blinks over short distances and does not affect spell immune or invulnerable enemies. Be sure to choose your targets wisely, as certain heroes can simply ignore its effects.<br/><br/>Try to cast Mana Leak as early as possible in teamfights, as the enemy may be forced to move closer in order to engage your teammates, and thus lose a sizable portion of their mana earlier. Under the right circumstances, it may be possible to destroy enough of an enemy's mana that they will run out in the middle of the fight and be unable to cast successive spells.<br/><br/>One useful utility for Mana Leak is to halt pursuing enemies. If an enemy is trying to pursue Keeper of the Light or one of his allies, Mana Leak will cause them to lose mana as they continue to pursue, which can be enough to force them to break off. If the enemy chooses to continue, they may find themselves stunned at an inopportune time, unable to cast spells, and threatened with long-duration stuns from successive casts of Mana Leak.<br/><h4>Chakra Magic</h4>Chakra Magic allows Keeper of the Light to replenish a significant amount of mana for himself and his allies, ensuring that spells can always be cast.<br/><br/>Chakra Magic is extremely useful in lane as it can allow teammates with small mana pools or low cooldown spells to cast their abilities much more frequently. Heroes with strong disables but small mana pools like Wraith King, Earthshaker, Sven and Vengeful Spirit can use their stuns much more frequently to set up kills in the knowledge that Ezalor can replenish their mana afterward, while those with powerful harass spells like Bristleback, Phantom Lancer and Undying can put continuous pressure on their lane opponents that would otherwise be impossible without a source of mana replenishment.<br/><br/>Due to its scaling, it is best to put at least two points into Chakra Magic in the laning stage, as its efficiency increases more than twofold. On top of providing more mana replenishment for allies, it also greatly increases Keeper of the Light's mana efficiently, allowing him to utilize his other spells more often.<br/><br/>Besides replenishing mana, Chakra Magic can reduce the cooldown of the next ability that the target uses in the next 15 seconds. This makes it a powerful ability to cast on teammates with low-cooldown disables and initiation spells, since it can allow them to use two stuns or nukes in quick succession, increasing the amount of crowd control available from a single spell. As well, it affects passive abilities with cooldowns, so abilities like Jinada, Geminate Attack and Greater Bash also benefit from the reduced cooldown.<br/><br/>Chakra Magic will also increase the maximum size of the target's mana pool for the duration of the buff, which can allow heroes with small mana pools but expensive spell combos to cast all of their spells instantaneously. For instance, a Venomancer without Arcane Boots will often have trouble casting his full round of spells due to the high cost of his ultimate, but casting Chakra Magic can allow him to cast his ultimate as well as Venomous Gale and any item abilities.<br/><h4>Spirit Form</h4>Spirit Form gives Keeper of the Light access to several very powerful abilities. Besides Recall and Blinding Light, Illuminate may be cast remotely without standing still to channel it, making it a very powerful ability.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful uses for Spirit Form is to unlock remote channeling of Illuminate, allowing Keeper of the Light to set the spell in place and then move on to execute other actions while it builds up. A Spirit Form-boosted Illuminate allows Ezalor to take advantage of a fully-channeled Illuminate without the drawback of having to sit still to charge it up.<br/><br/>When being chased, don't be afraid to use Spirit Form to aid in your escape. While Mana Leak can discourage enemies from chasing you, you can also cast Blinding Light to knock back and blind chasing enemies, or cast Illuminate in the direction you are headed, either forcing the enemy to walk in front of the channeling spirit and take damage, or break off and allow you to escape.<br/><br/>Purchasing an Aghanim's Scepter greatly increases the power of Spirit Form, as Ezalor will always have access to its abilities, on top of gaining unobstructed vision and being able to heal allies with Illuminate during the daytime. Using Illuminate will allow Keeper of the Light to continuously heal allied creep waves and heroes, significantly boosting his pushing and sustain power, while the unobstructed vision gives his team a strong vision advantage, especially once combined with a Gem of True Sight.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve provide health regeneration while laning, which mitigates harass damage by lane opponents. As well, they can be shared with Keeper of the Light's lane partner(s) as needed.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength is expensive but gives Keeper of the Light more health, which is always handy since he has a very small base health pool. They can also used to make a Bracer or Urn of Shadows.<br/><br/>Iron Branch gives some stats, and can be used to build a Magic Wand or Mekansm components.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should always be purchased by a support at the start of the game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed increase Keeper of the Light's mobility, which can be crucial for getting into position to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Magic Wand increases Keeper of the Light's stats for cheap, and provides even more burst regen. On a hard support, it can be a critical item to purchase for survivability.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Tranquil Boots are the cheapest upgrade options for Boots of Speed, and give Ezalor more armor and movement speed for little expense. The passive regen keeps his health at full, allowing him to be self-sustaining as he can replenish his mana with Chakra Magic, while the increased movement speed gives him more mobility for supporting and roaming.<br/><br/>Mekansm synergizes well with Keeper of the Light's support abilities, as he can heal his teammates as well as restore their mana. The overall stats and armor also provide Ezalor with considerably more survivability, while the item's high mana cost can be ignored due to Chakra Magic.<br/><br/>Observer Wards should always be purchased whenever they are in stock: it is the support's job to give their team vision around the map, and the vision they offer is very useful for getting into a good position to cast Illuminate from.<br/><br/>As a support, a Town Portal Scroll is always crucial, as Ezalor's abilities allow him to do a lot in teamfights or counter-ganks. Never go anywhere without at least one.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives Ezalor constant access to Spirit Form, as well as making Illuminate much more powerful. If your team intends to make the most of your pushing abilities, this is a very strong luxury item to purchase.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Boots of Travel are a very powerful item to have on Keeper of the Light. Besides the increased mobility and freeing up an item slot, the global teleport can be combined with Recall, allowing him to bring two heroes almost anywhere on the map.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is a good luxury item that gives Keeper of the Light more physical survivability, a larger mana pool and better teamfight contribution. The intelligence and armor allow Keeper of the Light to participate more in fights, while the attack speed aura and active freeze aura slows enemies' attempts to deal damage with their physical attacks and slows their movement speed with an additional damage nuke.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a good item for a ranged support who needs more survivability and a larger mana pool. Its active ability makes chasing or escaping from single enemies much easier due to its extremely long cast range and low cooldown.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides a large boost to attributes and excellent mana regeneration, allowing Keeper of the Light to use Chakra Magic on teammates more frequently instead of on himself. The Hex it offers is very powerful on Keeper of the Light, as he otherwise lacks an instant hard disable.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a good utility support item to purchase. It can increase Ezalor's survivability against magic nukes, allowing him to do more in teamfights, but its main purpose is to shield all teammates from magic damage for a short time.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives Keeper of the Light a sustainable mana pool and increased movement speed, allowing him to be much more active on the field. The active ability can be used to dispel debuffs such as silences while making Ezalor temporarily invulnerable, or disable an enemy long enough for Illuminate to charge up for more damage.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a good utility item that is powerful on all supports. It can be used for mobility, saving teammates, or forcibly dispositioning enemies, particularly effective when combined with Mana Leak and Blinding Light<br/><br/>Necronomicon is the right choice if you wish to push or contribute even more in fights: the attributes granted increase with every level, and the units it summons give bonus to you and your team (such as more movement and attack speed, as well as True Sight at level 3). The mana burn synergizes well with your Mana Leak.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord gives Ezalor stats across the board as well as armor, making him more survivable. Its active ability also gives him powerful teamfight contribution, especially Illuminate, and is a good item to buy if your team can capitalize on their magic nukes.<br/><br/>As a support, be sure to also upgrade the Animal Courier to a Flying Courier if the opportunity presents itself. As well, constant purchasing of Sentry Wards will allow you to de-ward the enemy, a crucial duty for supports.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a powerful utility item that gives Keeper of the Light more armor and some mana regen. As a ranged support, you have the ability to reduce an enemy's armor for your team to capitalize on, or give an ally more armor to extend their survivability. As well, it greatly helps when your team wants to kill Roshan.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is a good cheap item for giving Keeper of the Light survivability if he is constantly being jumped on by the enemy's carries. Immunity against physical damage will allow Ezalor time to cast more of his spells as needed.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a useful survivability and utility item. It increases the size of Keeper of the Light's health pool and grants him evasion against physical attacks, however its active ability can also be cast from behind teammates to disarm the enemy's carry for a short time, useful if they have a Monkey King Bar that ignores Blinding Light's miss chance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Leshrac is renowned as one of the strongest nukers in the game, who is capable of putting out tremendous amounts of area magical damage in order to destroy his foes. These nukes are strong at killing both heroes and creeps, making Leshrac a powerful foe both in teamfights and while pushing.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great wave clearing<br/><br/>Good tower pushing with Diabolic Edict<br/><br/>Large amounts of AOE magic damage<br/><br/>Good movement speed<br/><br/>Very low cooldown spells<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Bad strength and mediocre armor...<br/><br/>...but still needs to be in the thick of the fight to deal damage<br/><br/>Poor cast animations<br/><br/>Most of his damage output is completely negated by magic immunity<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>One of Leshrac's greatest weaknesses is his long cast animations. In order to counteract this, good positioning and prediction are key, as Leshrac must stand still for an extended period of time before the spell takes its effect.<br/><br/>While Leshrac has tremendous nuking power, much of it is damage over time, requiring him to survive long enough to cast multiple iterations. As such, not only is a large mana pool required in order to sustain such casting, but also enough HP to avoid dying to the enemy while casting.<br/><br/>Mind that because the vast majority of Leshrac's damage output is magical damage, he can be easily countered by spell immunity, and his frailty allows enemies to use his damage against him via Blade Mail. If Leshrac is to be effective in teamfights, he must focus on disabling enemies to prevent them from activating spell immunity, and build spell immunity himself both to increase his survivability and block Blade Mail damage.<br/><br/>Leshrac can usually be played as a core or a support.<br/>Played as a support, Leshrac has powerful disables that can greatly aid his team in fights, and can deal tremendous damage to enemy towers as well. His nuking spells also allow him to obtain gold fairly reliably for buying more support items. A support Leshrac should focus on purchasing utility items to aid his team in fights.<br/><br/>Played as a core, Leshrac has tremendous pushing and nuking power that can allow him to deal large amounts of damage in teamfights, or push lanes and take towers by himself. Once he has enough mana, he can use his nuking spells to farm very effectively as well. Core Leshrac should aim to build items that enhance his survivability and casting, as he must stay alive in order to put out the damage to kill enemies, and requires steady mana regeneration in order to fuel his costly and low-cooldown spells.<br/><br/><br/>All of Leshrac's spells have differing priorities to max out depending on his farm priority, team lineup and expected opposition. There is no one-size-fits-all build, as certain abilities may greatly synergize with those of allies, cover for their weaknesses, or exploit a flaw in the enemy's lineup.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Split Earth</h4>Split Earth is a ground-targeted spell that stuns enemies within its radius while dealing damage.<br/><br/>Split Earth will stun any targets it hits for 2 seconds, no matter how many levels were put into the spell. Therefore, it should be leveled up if you need the wider radius to make hitting the spell easier, or the increased damage.<br/><br/>Remember that the stun's effect occurs 0.35 seconds after the cast animation, so it will stun and damage roughly one second after Leshrac is commanded to cast the spell. If an enemy is watching your cast animations to predict when the stun will land, they can dodge its effects with certain spells (such as Phase Shift or Blade Fury). Therefore, if landing the stun without a leading disable, it can be useful to cancel the animation mid-way to fake out tricky opponents.<br/><br/>When using Split Earth as a support, it is best to only put one point into it early on and have a teammate lead with a reliable targeted stun first. If an enemy has been immobilized by a stun, they cannot move to avoid Split Earth and the long cast animation and small effect radius do not matter. This way, you can chain-stun an opponent and spend your skill points on your other nuking spells.<br/><br/>It's a good spell against Roshan as it won't trigger it's Spell block and you don't need to wonder if it's off cd.<br/><h4>Diabolic Edict</h4>Diabolic Edict causes physical damage explosions to surround Leshrac once cast, targeting any enemies near Leshrac and following him as he moves.<br/><br/>Edict deals tremendous amounts of damage if all the explosions land on a single target. It is best used after other enemy targets in the area, especially creeps, have been cleared away by your other spells, in order to make the most of its effects.<br/><br/>Diabolic Edict is what allows Leshrac to destroy towers so quickly by himself if he is left alone by the enemy team. A single cast of level 4 Diabolic Edict can deal 940 damage to a tier 1 tower, after reductions, which alone is enough to bring it below 30% HP (not including any creeps and siege units also attacking the tower). If pushing down the enemy's towers early on is a priority, consider maxing out Edict first.<br/><br/>Try to keep Diabolic Edict in reserve when attacking a tower, as the enemy may immediately use their Glyph of Fortification when they see you cast Edict. Try to force the enemy to fortify their towers, and then cast Edict afterward to deal the most damage possible.<br/><br/>The explosions follow Leshrac, and are focused on a radius around him, so even if there are enemy creeps near a tower it is possible to re-position Leshrac so that the tower is within the spell's radius but the enemy creeps are not. This also allows Leshrac to chase enemy heroes with the spell after casting it, as they will automatically hit any enemies that he is walking next to.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the explosions will still home in on invisible units if they are within the radius of the spell, and as such can be used as a weak form of detection. This means that Edict can be used as a counter against abilities such as Cloak and Dagger, Shadow Walk, Meld, and so on.<br/><h4>Lightning Storm</h4>Lightning Storm is a low-cooldown unit-targeted spell that damages and slows its target, then jumps to other nearby enemies. As such, it's a great spell to trigger a Linken's Sphere, although only the first bolt pops it.<br/><br/>Lightning Storm is a strong farming and wave-clearing spell, as its low cooldown and area targeted nature allows Leshrac to deal large amounts of magical damage in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>Lightning Storm is the perfect complement to Diabolic Edict, as the spell's nuking power and low cooldown can make short work of lane creeps, allowing Diabolic Edict to be focused on the enemy's tower alone. As well, it can be used as a leading slow on an enemy prior to casting Split Earth.<br/><br/>Try to take advantage of Lightning Storm's long cast range and ability to bounce. It can be a powerful harassing spell as Leshrac can hit a creep with the spell and allow it to bounce to the enemy hero.<br/><h4>Pulse Nova</h4>Pulse Nova deals tremendous amounts of damage to all nearby enemies, and is a toggled spell that does not require a cast animation. It is a powerful spell to use when chasing or fleeing, especially alongside Diabolic Edict, as it can remain active while moving, allowing Leshrac to run down foes or discourage them from chasing him.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Pulse Nova requires Leshrac to stand very close to the targets he wishes to damage. If you intend on using Pulse Nova in team fights, survivability items that boost Leshrac's HP are highly recommended.<br/><br/>Note that since Pulse Nova can be toggled, it can also be used as a farming spell by turning it on while farming creep waves or jungle camps, adding to your nuking power.<br/><br/>Since the first damage instance is dealt immediately upon toggling the spell on, the damage per second of Pulse Nova can be increased by constantly toggling it off then on after every two damage instances. However, the cost of this tactic is a significantly higher mana cost due to incurring the toggle cost multiple times, so ensure that Leshrac's mana pool is sufficient to support it.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tango are generally the minimum amount of regen needed no matter what position is being played.<br/><br/>All of Leshrac's spells are mana-costly, so bringing at least one Clarity will greatly help as it allows more use of your spells early on. In particular, being able to use Split Earth more frequently can help with setting up kills in the early game.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength is an expensive starting purchase, but good for mitigating Leshrac's early frailty and building into a Bracer.<br/><br/>Purchasing the Animal Courier for your team is important when playing as a support. Ensure that your team has a courier at the start of the match.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is important on Leshrac since his HP is quite low throughout the game, and the burst mana regen can give you enough mana to cast one more spell in a fight.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are important to get early on Leshrac since he needs good positioning in order to get his spells off. As well, the extra speed allows you to chase fleeing enemies with Diabolic Edict if needed.<br/><br/>Bracer is important for improving Leshrac's strength so that he has more survivability in fights.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand provides attributes and increased charge storage for more burst regen. It can be crucial to purchase as a support in order to increase survivability.<br/><br/>Phase Boots are very powerful on Leshrac, both as a core and a support, as the movement speed boost allows him to position for spells and chase with Diabolic Edict and Pulse Nova, or flee more easily. The bonus damage also helps with last-hitting to increase your farming rate.<br/><br/>Bloodstone cannot realistically be expected when playing as a support, however as a core it is a very important item to get. The increased HP and mana will give Leshrac immense survivability and the ability to cast his spells profligately, while the greatly increased mana regen can sustain his spell casting.<br/><br/>Observer Wards are important to purchase regularly when playing as a support. Map vision provides ganking and split-pushing opportunities for you, as well as allowing your team to gain map control.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important on all heroes, but should be carried on Leshrac at all times due to his ability to nuke down enemies on top of his disables, both of which make him a powerful ally to have in any engagement.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Veil of Discord is quite powerful on a support Leshrac as it gives him survivability through stats and armor, while the active ability drastically improves the nuking power of all his spells. It is a useful utility purchase for a team with multiple magic nukes.<br/><br/>Black King Bar gives Leshrac additional strength, which increases the size of his HP pool, and prevents him from being disabled, allowing him to get within close proximity to damage the enemy with his spells. As a core, it provides Leshrac with immense survivability against disables and any burst magic nukes the enemy may have, as well as immunity against Blade Mail.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very powerful item on any intelligence hero, and is no exception in Leshrac's case. The larger mana pool and enhanced mana regen allow him to push much harder without worrying about running out of mana for his spells, the extra stats give him survivability, and the item's active allows you to instantly hard-disable an enemy hero, particularly their carry, and follow up with an easy Split Earth.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a good purchase if you can already chase the enemy with Pulse Nova, and need something to give yourself more damage output. The stats also increase your survivability and give you more mana, allowing you to further take advantage of your ultimate.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a useful positioning item that allows you to cast your spells more effectively. Used to initiate or chase, you can put yourself immediately within Diabolic Edict and Pulse Nova range, and in a pinch, it can be used as an escape item.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard enhances Leshrac's survivability against physical damage while also increasing his mana pool. Once you've built enough HP items and can ensure that you will not get chain-disabled, giving yourself more armor can allow you to weather right-clicks extremely well. By using the active blast, you can slow enemies down to keep them within range of Pulse Nova.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a good purchase as a support, as it is relatively cheap and gives you HP and mana. The active ability can drastically slow a target from long range, allowing you to catch up and land an easy Split Earth.<br/><br/>Be sure to upgrade to the Flying Courier as soon as possible when playing as a support. Giving your carries faster access to their needed items is essential in the early game.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is very powerful on heroes with low-cooldown burst magic nukes, which makes it the perfect item to build on a core Leshrac. Besides the immense HP and mana bonuses it provides, the cooldown reduction allows Leshrac to put out even more damage in fights, and the spell lifesteal allows him to maintain his own HP pool from that damage. Once Leshrac has built up enough survivability to ensure that he can keep dealing damage with his spells, purchasing an Octarine Core can make him almost unkillable.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a very strong utility item in the hands of Leshrac. Besides providing him with additional magic resistance, the active can act as an initiation aid to get within range to cast a disable, and can be cast on allies as well to safeguard them against magic nukes.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves can be strong on Leshrac, no matter what role he is played in. The item increases his survivability via additional stats and armor, as well as the aura, and the active both heals him and removes debuffs the enemy may have placed on him, giving him more time to get his spells off.<br/><br/>Sentry Ward is important to purchase regularly as support Leshrac in order to remove enemy map vision. As support Leshrac is a frail and easy target to kill, taking away the enemy's vision can aid in his survivability, and allow him to better position himself to cast his spells without as much enemy interference.<br/><br/>Null Talisman is a strong early purchase as a core Leshrac, particularly in the mid lane. It gives him good starting stats, particularly intelligence and some extra bonus damage to aid in last-hitting. The intelligence also increases the size of his mana pool to allow him to use his spells to harass his lane opponent and flash-farm the creep waves more often.<br/><br/>Bottle gives mid Leshrac HP and mana sustain, ensuring that he can continue to lane even after using all of his starting regen; in particular, the mana regen allows him to cast his nukes more profligately. Bottling runes also gives him an edge in fights and laning.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good utility item to purchase on a support Leshrac over a Bracer. It boosts his strength to give him more HP, and a small amount of mana regen to aid in casting. The active allows Leshrac to heal himself or teammates, particularly useful on Leshrac as his small HP pool makes Urn charges go farther, or can add additional damage on top of his existing nukes.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots are useful for building if mana is more important than mobility. As a support it allows Leshrac to sustain his mana pool and replenish allies' mana as well, while as a core it can shore up his mana pool for more extensive spell casting and lead to an easier buildup to Bloodstone.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a good stat item to build, as it gives Leshrac more HP as well as mana. The extra movement speed allows Leshrac to position for his spells more easily, and the active allows for chases using Pulse Nova no matter what role Leshrac is played in.<br/><br/>Force Staff is useful for building on Leshrac as a support, as the item's utility makes it powerful for re-positioning to cast spells or as a movement booster during escapes. As well, it can be used to chase with Diabolic Edict and Pulse Nova more effectively.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a good utility item no matter what role Leshrac is played in. The cyclone can be used to disable an enemy and land an easy Split Earth, while the increased mana pool and mana regen allow for more sustained spell casting. The additional movement speed also helps in chasing with Edict and Pulse Nova.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel allow Leshrac to globally re-position, and frees up an inventory slot due to not needing a Town Portal Scroll anymore. As well, the enhanced movement speed allows Leshrac to chase down almost any enemy he fixes his sights on.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere helps to increase a core Leshrac's survivability. The improved attributes make him tankier and give him more mana, while Spellblock can cancel unit-targeted spells that may otherwise disable Leshrac as he approaches enemies to catch them within range of his nukes.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lich is a ranged intelligence hero that is primarily used to win the laning stage of the game with Sacrifice. Sacrifice denies the opponent experience points and gives them to you and your allies. Once past the laning stage, Lich is still a threat with Chain Frost. Lich does not have any strong escape mechanism and is rather frail, so proper positioning is a must.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Almost always able to dominates the laning stage and thus securing the early advantage for your team<br/><br/>Simple to play, great for beginners<br/><br/>A good nuker with spammable Frost Blast<br/><br/>Able to destroy the enemy team if they are poorly positioned and huddled close with Chain Frost.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no escape capabilities and is quite frail<br/><br/>Is not as strong past the laning/early stage of the game<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lich focuses on mana to support his allies, so investing on Intelligence is important for usage of abilities, extra damage, and mana.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Frost Blast</h4>Frost Blast is a slowing damaging spell used for harassing and dealing with creeps, and is more effective when used on a hero close to a group of creeps. This is Lich's only AOE damage-dealing spell, so paired with Sacrifice it can be a good farming spell.<br/><br/>Frost Blast only deals damage at a small area, so Sacrifice is really good for using it repeatedly.<br/><br/>Frost Blast doesn't deal much damage, so use it for creeps or for chasing enemies.<br/><br/>When casting Frost Blast on enemy heroes in lane to harass them, try to follow up with a few attacks on them while they're slowed.<br/><h4>Sacrifice</h4>In the early game, Sacrifice is primarily used to control the lane equilibrium and deny the opponent vital early experience points. Constantly casting Sacrifice will tend to have your creeps closer to your tower thus Lich or whoever he is support will have a safer place to farm. It also allows Lich and his allies to grossly out-level whoever Lich is laning against and thus able to net kills or force the opponent out of his lane with stronger spells. In the later stages, it will be mainly used for obtaining mana.<br/><br/>Use Sacrifice for fueling Chain Frost, as it gives good mana.<br/><br/>Typically you would want to use Sacrifice on a high health creep, because the obtained mana is based on HP or hitpoints. But in the laning stage, focus on casting it on the ranged creep as it provides the most gold and experience for the enemy.<br/><br/>Dropping items that increases your mana pool like Arcane Boots or Aghanim's Scepter before casting Sacrifice will net you more mana. Be careful when doing it in front of your enemies as they can deny your item. This is especially important if Sacrifice is not maxed out.<br/><h4>Ice Armor</h4>A good support spell, Ice Armor can protect buildings and heroes, giving them resistance to attacks.When the Glyph of Fortification isn't available, Ice Armor can give some bulk to towers and buildings.<br/><br/>Ice Armor can be used on squishy heroes too for some defense, or, even better, to provide additional resistance for bulky heroes.<br/><br/>Putting Ice Armor on autocast or continuously applying it on teammates can often give your team an immense armor boost.<br/><br/>If the laning stage is going fine, and the enemy solo offlaner is getting crushed, putting an early level in Ice Armor and casting it on jungling teammates can give them much better sustain in the jungle.<br/><h4>Chain Frost</h4>Chain Frost is a massive damage-dealing, slowing, multi-target nuke. It is very fatal when bouncing between enemy heroes, doing massive damage and slowing them.Chain Frost is most effective when used on a group of enemy heroes with Aghanim's Scepter on Lich because this removes the limit of bounces, making it a very dangerous orb of frozen death, enabling him to do a one-on-five fight.<br/><br/>Abilities that trap or disable multiple enemies sync well with Chain Frost, because this allows Lich to not worry about enemies separating far enough to surpass the bounce range.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lina is a powerful ranged intelligence hero that can be played as a support or a semi-carry. Her abilities allow her to nuke and stun multiple heroes at once and her strong ultimate can annihilate low health heroes. Her passive allows her right-clicks to far exceed that of other typical intelligence heroes, giving her a very respectable amount of physical damage output. Played well, Lina is an extremely strong ganking hero who can kill out of position heroes all by herself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong AoE nukes.<br/><br/>Very powerful single target nuke.<br/><br/>Long attack range.<br/><br/>Deals fairly high physical damage with passive.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slow cast animations.<br/><br/>Slow attack animation.<br/><br/>No mobility.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lina has one of the longest attack ranges in the game, but also the slowest attack animation. Time your attacks well to get last hits.<br/><br/>Always cancel the backswing animation after casting your spells, as Lina suffers from long animation times.<br/><br/>In teamfights it can be very beneficial to quickly focus on low-HP or support heroes, as Lina has very good nuking abilities.<br/><br/>If Lina has the basic items she needs, it is wise to augment her physical attack for the sake of Fiery Soul. Almost uniquely among Intelligence supports, Lina's autoattacks becomes a serious threat if she attains a level advantage (owing to her enormous intelligence growth and her passive ability).<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Dragon Slave</h4>Use Dragon Slave to harass and get last hits in lane.<br/><br/>Dragon Slave's range is deceptively long, and can be used to finish off fleeing opponents, or as a parting shot when retreating.<br/><br/>Max Dragon Slave first if your intent is to deal the most damage possible.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Light Strike Array</h4>Light Strike Array is often leveled first because the stun can either save Lina or help her finish a gank.<br/><br/>Combining Light Strike Array with a guaranteed stun such as Magic Missile or Storm Hammer makes Lina a serious ganking force early on.<br/><br/>Light Strike Array has a very long cast animation. Make sure to target near Lina, so she doesn't need to move into range before casting it.<br/><br/>Positioning items such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity, Blink Dagger or Force Staff can help land Light Strike Array and thus Lina's whole spell combo without relying on other heroes.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Fiery Soul</h4>One early point in Fiery Soul can boost Lina's harass potential, especially after landing Light Strike Array on an enemy, as her attack speed will be temporarily increased.<br/><br/>Use all of Lina's other abilities first to take the speed-enhancing effect of Fiery Soul to its maximum potential.<br/><br/>It is sometimes acceptable to use Lina's other abilities simply to gain Fiery Soul's speed bonuses, such as when attacking a tower, or when you're certain no enemies are nearby.<br/><br/>In a prolonged teamfight, remember to continuously use Lina's abilities the moment they come off cooldown, so her attack speed remains high throughout the fight.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Laguna Blade</h4>Upon reaching level six, immediately begin looking for opportunities to use Laguna Blade, as few enemies can withstand its massive damage in the early game. A few kills with Laguna Blade in the early game can put Lina's team comfortably ahead.<br/><br/>In most cases, it is better to deal the burst damage right away in teamfights instead of saving Laguna Blade until the very last moment to finish an enemy.<br/>Only save Laguna Blade for situations where ending an enemy decisively would prevent them from recovering, such as against targets with high health regeneration.<br/><br/><br/>Do not waste Laguna Blade on a target that is certain to die.<br/><br/>Laguna Blade can hit for 1700 pure damage if she combines Aghanim's Scepter and Refresher Orb, granting her enormous nuking power.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Early-game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is useful since Lina is squishy and has multiple high-cost low-cooldown spells picking up a Magic Stick can increase her early staying power greatly.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed helps Lina get into position to land her abilities while avoiding danger zones.<br/><br/>Bracer is a cheap and quick way of patching up Lina's naturally low HP pool.<br/><br/>Bottle is a common pickup for Lina when playing in the mid lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Phase Boots will further improve Lina's positioning as she has below average move speed by default. It will also compliment the natural attack speed she gains from Fiery Soul to improve its effectiveness early on.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots is a viable alternative, especially for a more support oriented Lina.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger gives Lina the ability to stay back in safety, then blink in at an opportune moment to cast her Light Strike Array before the enemy can see it coming and evade it.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity enhances Lina's positioning even further and greatly boosts her mana-regeneration because of her high base Intelligence and Intelligence gain. It can also be used to set up Light Strike Array fairly reliably.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter roughly boosts Lina's Laguna Blade damage by another ability point, increases her survivability because of the increase to her attributes, and lets her damage stay relevant even against Black King Bar users in the mid or late game.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a natural upgrade from the Bracer she could pick up in the early game. It slightly improves her own positioning and all attributes for relatively low cost and also benefits her team.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can be useful for a carry Lina, as it helps her to cast Light Strike Array while invisible, and also provides her with an escape mechanism.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives her team an important disable that also helps to ensure she lands Light Strike Array. Furthermore, its attribute bonuses will make her a bit more survivable and drastically improve her mana regeneration.<br/><br/>Bloodstone can solve Lina's mana issues while also improving her low HP pool. With enough charges, she can keep up her full stacks of Fiery Soul without having to worry about being out of mana during the next team fight.<br/><br/>Crystalys provides a good damage boost when playing as a semi-carry Lina, and can be upgraded in either Daedalus or Bloodthorn depending on your preference.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is sometimes picked up when Lina is carrying, especially against teams with many disables.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard both helps with Lina's mana regeneration problems as well as her low armor value while also benefiting her team with Shiva's Guard's aura and active ability.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos provides Lina with a larger mana pool that becomes more important as teamfights expand and Laguna Blade becomes more mana-intensive, as well as a significant boost to her low HP pool. Its active effect can also greatly assist in landing her stun, and has a low enough cooldown to do so almost as soon as Light Strike Array comes off cooldown again.<br/><br/>Flying Courier is a staple item choice for any support hero that wants to ensure their team members can get their items as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Octarine Core's lifesteal gives more survival potential in teamfights. Also, it gives a huge intelligence boost, as well as a greater ability to spam spells.<br/><br/>Aether Lens provides a decent boost to Lina's damage, and makes it significantly easier to land her abilities.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade is a decent luxury item if the farm is available. It allows Lina to amplify her magical nukes, and slows enemies to help her land them. Using the active on herself is also a good escape mechanism against late game carries.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Lion is a powerful spellcaster and is mostly played as support or ganker hero due to his disabling spells. He is best to partner with auto attack carries or another spellcaster to finish enemies quickly. His Earth Spike and his Hex make him a formidible disabler, while his Mana Drain can prevent enemy heroes from casting spells if done effectively and allowed to drain. His Finger of Death can easily nuke the chosen enemy, dealing incredible damage to help his allies or himself finish a kill.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>One of the best disabler hero.<br/><br/>Good early/mid game nuker.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Easily targeted due to low health.<br/><br/>Slow movement.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Lion is renowned for being one of the strongest disabling supports in the game. He has two hard disables in Hex and Earth Spike, which allow him to set up kills in virtually any situation once he hits level 2, potentially giving his team a strong early advantage with his combination of nukes and disables. Be sure to layer your disables properly, in order to lock down a target for the longest possible duration instead of stacking the disables and wasting one or both.<br/><br/>Like most other intelligence-based casters, Lion suffers from low strength and agility growth, making him frail and easy to kill if focused down. Due to this and his strong array of disables, Lion benefits greatly from building survivability and mobility items, as his great intelligence growth combined with his Mana Drain ability means that he is never wanting for mana to cast his spells.<br/><br/>Beware that due to his single-target nature, all of Lion's spells can be blocked with Linken's Sphere, or even worse reflected with Lotus Orb. As such, be extremely careful about when and where you cast your spells, and be sure to regularly check the enemy's inventory so that you know if they are building towards either item.<br/><br/>Because of his powerful early disabling potential, Lion can be played in a variety of ways.<br/>In most cases, Lion is played as a hard support, protecting his safe lane carry by pulling neutral camps and harassing the enemy off-laner. He is also able to set up kills with his disables if he is able to get within range to cast them on the enemy, whether it be their off-laner or rotating to gank their mid-laner.<br/><br/>True to his name, Lion is also a strong roamer who can prowl and pounce on enemies in their lanes, using his disables to hold them in place while his teammates kill them.<br/><br/>In unusual circumstances, Lion can also be a respectable mid, as his good base damage allows him to compete with other mid heroes with last-hits, and his disables allow him to set up the enemy mid if supports rotate for a gank. The early gold and levels can allow him to transition into a strong roaming who can catch enemies with his disables and nuke them down with Finger of Death.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Earth Spike</h4>Earth Spike is a disable that deals damage and stuns in a line in front of Lion, making it a well-rounded stun and nuke.<br/><br/>Because both its damage and stun duration scale with levels, Earth Spike is generally Lion's best ability to max out first. This allows Lion to deal respectable nuke damage and disable for a good duration with a single spell.<br/><br/>Earth Spike is unusual in that it can be both ground-targeted and unit-targeted. This allows the spell to be used both as a reliable and unreliable disable, however, it also means that the spell can be blocked by Linken's Sphere even if ground-targeted.<br/><br/>Due to its line target nature, Earth Spike can potentially damage and stun multiple targets at once. If the opportunity presents itself, try to position yourself such that you can line up a stun on at least two enemies at once.<br/><br/>One unusual aspect of Earth Spike is that it can be targeted at only 500 range but travels up to 825, possibly hitting enemies up to 950 units away. This means that while the spell can reliably stun an enemy at 500 range or less, with skill it can be used as an unreliable stun to disable an enemy at almost twice that distance.<br/><br/>Beware that Earth Spike does have a travel time, and that it is possible for the enemy to dodge the spikes near the end of the spell if they are fast enough. As such, it can pay off to get as close as possible to a target before casting Earth Spike on them, to give them as little time to react if possible.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the elevated spike animation will still play if the spell catches an invisible hero. While it cannot be used to reliably search for invisible enemies due to its thin radius, a successful hit will alert allies to a stunned invisible enemy, allowing them to cast an area-targeted unreliable disable or nuke on that spot.<br/><h4>Hex</h4>Hex is an extremely powerful hard disable that can silence and mute its target, preventing them from casting spells or using items. As well, it has an instant cast animation, giving the enemy absolutely no time to react.<br/><br/>Due to its poor scaling, Hex is generally best left with one point in the early game. Each additional level only adds half a second to the disable duration while drastically increasing the mana cost, which can tax Lion's mana pool beyond its limit. It is better left as the last ability to max out, as Lion can replenish his mana pool reliably with more levels in Mana Drain, and it is unlikely that targets need to be hard-disabled multiple times in the early game when all-out teamfights are rare.<br/><br/>Due to its instant cast time, Hex is a powerful initiating disable since it can lock down a target immediately when Lion gets within range to cast it. As well, the slow it inflicts on the target makes them an easier target to hit with a followed up Earth Spike. However, this will generally vary according to the situation, as Earth Spike's longer disable range can allow Lion to disable an enemy from a greater distance away first, then follow up with a longer-duration Hex.<br/><br/>Hex can instantly destroy illusions, making it a powerful counter to certain illusion heroes and Manta Style. If the enemy can create a small number of powerful illusions with abilities like Replicate, Phantasm or Mirror Image, Lion can instantly remove one of them from play or hard-disable the source of the illusions directly. And if an enemy uses Manta Style defensively, Hex can instantly remove one of them, increasing the chance of finding the right hero to 50%.<br/><br/>In dire situations, Hex can be cast defensively as well. If a lone enemy initiates on Lion and he is unable to kill them with his nukes, casting a max level Hex on them will disable them for 4 seconds, more than enough time for Lion to channel a Town Portal Scroll to escape.<br/><h4>Mana Drain</h4>Mana Drain is a strong utility and soft-disable spell that allows Lion to roam independently as he can maintain a near-limitless supply of mana.<br/><br/>Next to Earth Spike, Mana Drain can be a powerful spell to max out early on. While it is not very strong at level 1, getting it to level 2 allows Lion to start recouping the mana cost of his spells, giving him the mana to cast his full combo whenever he needs to. At level 4, it can drain mana at double the rate that it does at level 3, making much more powerful.<br/><br/>Used judiciously, Mana Drain can hinder enemies' attempts to lane as Lion can threaten to remove their mana pool if they remain in the area while he casts this spell on them. It is particularly effective against melee heroes that have to approach the creep wave to last-hit, and used over time it can force them to leave the lane as they will not have the mana to cast any of their spells, including escape abilities in the event of a gank.<br/><br/>While Mana Drain can be a powerful harass tool in the laning stage, it can leave Lion wide open to retaliation since it is a channeled spell that forces him to stand still. Be sure that the enemy is not in a position to jump on him before attempting to cast this spell on them, and that allies are ready to come to your aid if necessary.<br/><br/>Remember that Mana Drain can be cast on any non-friendly unit that has a mana pool, not just enemy heroes. This means that Lion can drain mana from ranged lane creeps, as well as neutral creeps with mana pools. However, keep in mind that casting this spell on neutral creeps will draw aggro, so it is best to cast it when they are otherwise occupied in order to avoid taking damage while draining mana.<br/><br/>Past the laning stage, Mana Drain has strong utility despite its seemingly mediocre effects. Its ability to drain up to 120 MP/sec means that, when combined with other disables, it can completely destroy an enemy's ability to retaliate at all as they will have no mana to cast any spells or use certain active abilities. It can be extremely powerful against heroes with small mana pools that rely on survivability abilities, with Reincarnation being one of the most prominent examples.<br/><br/>Like Hex, Mana Drain is capable of destroying illusions, removing them from play upon the first drain instance (0.1 seconds after casting). As its cooldown and mana cost is even lower than Hex, Mana Drain can effectively destroy an illusion every four seconds.<br/><br/>When used in combination with Earth Spike and Hex, Mana Drain can allow Lion to completely remove Manta Style illusions from the field: use Earth Spike to disable all three targets and identify the real hero by how much damage they take, destroy an illusion with Mana Drain, and follow up with Hex on the hero once Earth Spike's stun ends. The second illusion can be destroyed at leisure once Mana Drain comes off cooldown.<br/><br/>Due to its long cast range, Mana Drain can be used to break an enemy's Linken's Sphere ahead of a fight or gank. However, be very careful when attempting this, as Mana Drain's cast animation can add an additional delay that the enemy can take advantage of.<br/><h4>Finger of Death</h4>Finger of Death is one of the most powerful magic nukes in the game, capable of dealing a tremendous amount of damage to a single target.<br/><br/>In general, it is best to use Finger of Death at the start of an engagement, rather than in an attempt to finish off a foe. Using the nuke on an enemy at the earliest opportunity will ensure that it deals all of its damage rather than a portion of it, and can allow your team to kill the target faster. As well, it is usually wise to try to let your team's carries score the last hit and claim credit for the kill, as they can usually make better use of the gold than Lion can. However, if there is a chance that the target may escape, do not hesitate to take the kill yourself, as getting a kill on the support and assist gold on other teammates is better than missing the kill and everybody getting nothing at all.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that there is a 0.25 second damage delay once Finger of Death connects with a target, meaning that the damage will take effect 0.55 seconds after giving Lion the command. This delay can allow players with quick reaction times to evade its damage and possibly escape death, as activating spell immunity or becoming hidden/invulnerable will effectively dodge the damage, wasting the spell.<br/><br/>Due to its strong nuking potential, Finger of Death can be profitably used on a squishy enemy support rather than trying to damage the enemy carry. At the start of a teamfight, if the opportunity presents itself to instantly remove an enemy player from the field, it can benefit your team far more than dealing more damage to their tanky carry: killing a support at the start will prevent not only any high-impact spells they might otherwise cast, but also any items that could give their team an advantage (such as Mekansm or Crimson Guard). Be sure to use your judgment and choose your targets wisely.<br/><br/>Beware that Finger of Death's nuke can be turned against you if the enemy builds the right items. A Blade Mail can cause Lion to blow himself up as well as the enemy, preventing him from further using his disables in a fight, while a Lotus Orb can amount to the same result, but even worse can potentially allow the enemy to bounce the beam onto Lion's allies. Check the enemy's inventory for such items ahead of time, and be sure to refrain from casting your spells if the enemy attempts to bait you.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tangoes and a Healing Salve provide HP sustain in-lane, allowing Lion to remain active despite enemy harass.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength, while expensive as a starting item, provides Lion with strength, increasing his meager HP and giving him some more survivability.<br/><br/>Iron Branch is cheap and can be purchased with any leftover gold, giving Lion some additional stats. It can be built into a Magic Wand or Mekansm components if needed.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should always be purchased by the support. If another support purchases courier, it is advised to purchase other support items such as Observer Wards.<br/><br/>Observer Ward should always be picked up when available, one of the core duties of a support. Spotting enemy movements allows Lion and his team to re-position to meet them, and lets Lion pounce on his foes with his array of disables and nukes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Flying Courier should be purchased as soon as it is available if playing in the hard support role.<br/><br/>Magic Stick gives Lion burst HP and mana regen, critical to have on hand for low-HP casters whose spells can make large differences in teamfights. While a fully-charged Magic Stick is not fully guaranteed to allow Lion to cast one more spell if he's out of mana, it can buy him a few seconds to contribute more in an engagement or escape pursuers.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed is important to get early on Lion due to his strong disables. The extra movement speed allows Lion to chase enemies and get into position to cast his disables, securing early kills for his team.<br/><br/>Bracer can be upgraded from Gauntlets of Strength, giving Lion more HP as well as additional other attributes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a great upgrade for extra attributes and the additional charges, always useful on hard supports. Its cheap price makes it useful on Lion, who will not always have the gold to buy better items.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are the best boots upgrade for Lion, as they are cheap and give him everything he needs. The passive HP regen keeps his health pool topped off, synergizing with his ability to keep his mana pool at full with Mana Drain. The additional armor gives him increased survivability, while the increased movement speed gives him better roaming and positioning ability.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a powerful utility and mobility item on Lion that grants him more mana, base damage, and some HP sustain. It can serve as an inferior substitute to Blink Dagger, or as a supplement to further increase Lion's mobility. The active can also be used to help allies re-position as needed, or on an enemy to disposition them or instantly break their Linken's Sphere ahead of other disables.<br/><br/>Sentry Ward is crucial to purchase regularly as a support Lion. As a ranged hero, Lion can destroy enemy Observer Wards he finds, taking away map vision from the enemy team.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to carry at all times. Lion's nuking and disabling potential allows him to turn ganks and teamfights completely around if he is present.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is a very strong item to obtain on Lion. The increased mana pool allows Lion to more easily get off his spell combos due to the high cost of Finger of Death, and can be easily replenished with Mana Drain, while the HP regen works alongside Tranquil Boots to keep Lion's HP topped up. The cast range increase can greatly extend the reach of all of Lion's spells, especially Hex and Earth Spike for disabling foes, and the spell damage amp makes his nukes deal additional damage as well.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Mekansm is useful to build on Lion if no other teammates can utilize the item effectively. The additional stats and armor increase Lion's survivability, while the heal drastically improves his teamfight contribution. As well, Lion does not suffer from the tremendous mana cost of the item as he can always recoup it with Mana Drain.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is extremely powerful on Lion, and should be considered a core item no matter his farm situation. The ability to instantly jump on top of enemies allows him to get much more use out of Hex and Earth Spike, greatly increasing the odds of getting kills on the enemy.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel are invaluable in the late game for the additional movement speed and ability to globally teleport. The movement speed helps with Lion's positioning and chasing, while the teleport allows him to jump to allied creeps to set up or participate in kill opportunities on other parts of the map.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is expensive, but is a strong late-game item on any casting-oriented support. In Lion's case, it gives him better overall stats and reduces his reliance on Mana Drain, while also adding yet another instant hard disable to his already formidable arsenal.<br/><br/>Dagon drastically increases Lion's nuking potential, as it allows him to double up on the already formidable nuking power of Finger of Death. However, it is extremely expensive to upgrade and can be relatively useless if bought too late, so it is best purchased if Lion already has a strong gold advantage and needs to end the game early.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly augments Finger of Death's killing power, as well as drastically reducing its cooldown to allow it to be used tactically. It is best purchased if Lion is given farm priority and his team has good crowd control that can group up the enemy to hit them with the area of effect.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows can be a strong alternative purchase over Bracer. Given his roaming ability, Lion can accumulate charges relatively easily, and then use those charges offensively or defensively, healing his team or dealing more damage in fights.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage gives Lion more utility, along with a blend of armor and mana regeneration. As a ranged support with strong disables, Lion can use the active on gank targets, increasing the damage they take from teammates' physical attacks. It can also be used on Roshan to reduce his armor, and later upgraded into a Solar Crest for even more benefits.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is useful on low-HP casters such as Lion. The ability to evade physical damage for a short duration can buy Lion time to survive if the enemy attempts to focus him down, giving him the few seconds he may need to get his spells off.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape gives Lion strong utility and some initiation power. The active can allow Lion to invisibly approach gank targets and get within range to cast his disables, and can even be used as a shield while channeling Mana Drain. More importantly, it can be cast on allies who are caught out of position, granting them invisibility and strong magic resistance to aid them in escaping.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity can give Lion some very strong benefits. The item grants more movement speed, giving him more mobility, as well as some more intelligence and mana regen to help him with casting. The active ability can be used either as an additional disable on the enemy, or on Lion himself to give him temporary invulnerability while purging debuffs like silences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Nature's Prophet is a very unorthodox hero most renowned for his ability to push and gank, as his combination of abilities gives him powerful global presence and pushing potential. However, the hero himself is quite frail and can be killed easily if caught by the enemy.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Global presence<br/><br/>Great pusher<br/><br/>Powerful late game<br/><br/>Versatility to fit any role<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Farm dependent<br/><br/>Low armor/spell resistance<br/><br/>Squishy early-game<br/><br/>Highly dependent on map awareness<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>Due to his global mobility, map awareness is extremely important with Nature's Prophet. Good Nature's Prophet play requires paying constant attention to the map in order to find opportunities to exploit the enemy's weak spots. Since Teleportation allows Nature's Prophet to quickly re-position himself to any point on the map, he can effectively assist in ganks, help allies in need, aggressively push lanes when the enemy leave them unattended, finish off fleeing enemies, and so on.<br/><br/>Generally, Nature's Prophet can be effective in almost any lane required by his team. His flexibility allows him to perform well in many roles.<br/><br/>Most frequently, Nature's Prophet is played as a jungler, as his ability to summon Treants through Nature's Call allows him to kill neutral camps relatively safely by using the Treants to tank their attacks. While this can end up weakening his team's laning by leaving his safe lane more vulnerable to enemy offlane aggression, it also improves his team's overall economy by allowing four heroes to farm at the same time rather than just three.<br/><br/>Nature's Prophet can also be played as an off-laner, as he can disrupt creep equilibrium by using Nature's Call. By kiting the enemy creep wave using Treants, he can secure last-hits and experience for himself even if the enemy attempts to pull neutral camps. As well, the Treants can disrupt enemy pulls or outright block the pull camp from spawning, as the enemy will be unable to kill Treants in a timely manner in the laning stage.<br/><br/>Unlike most other casting-focused intelligence heroes, Nature's Prophet relies on his physical attacks to deal damage. His respectable base damage, ample attack range and good attack animation give him a strong edge when trading attacks with enemies in the laning stage, and can be a force to be reckoned with when boosted up by farming items that give him more damage and attack speed.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Sprout</h4>In general, only one early skill point should be taken in Sprout, as it does not scale as well compared to Nature's Prophet's other spells. While the skill benefits from being maxed out eventually, Nature's Prophet can benefit more in the early game from putting his skill points into other spells.<br/><br/>The most basic use of Sprout is to pen in an enemy hero to block off their movement so that they can be focused down and killed. Keep in mind, however, that the trees can still be destroyed by items such as Tango and Quelling Blade, both of which are common in the early game, as well as abilities such as Midnight Pulse and Powershot. As such, be careful not to assume that it will be a foolproof way to trap enemies.<br/>Conversely to the above, however, Sprout can be a powerful spell in the late game, when nobody has a Quelling Blade or Tango anymore. Against the right line-ups, it can potentially lock down enemies for its full duration, as spell immunity will not allow them to path through the trees, meaning that their only method of escape will be through their own abilities (which can be silenced) or items such as Battle Fury or Force Staff, which may not always be on hand.<br/><br/>When casting Sprout to hinder enemies' pathing, remember that it does not have to be targeted directly on an enemy. Placing the trees to block an enemy's path can limit their escape options (such as forcing them to run towards your allies), or can prevent reinforcements from coming to their teammate's aid by halting their approach and splitting the battlefield. Try to be creative with how you use Sprout, as its low cooldown, long cast range and high duration allow it to be cast multiple times in a single engagement to great effect.<br/><br/><br/>Remember that at level 1, Sprout lasts for 3 seconds, exactly enough time to channel Teleportation or to use a Town Portal Scroll (provided you are not teleporting to a building that an ally has recently teleported to). As such, it can be used to shroud yourself in the fog of war while escaping, but beware that enemies can still use area-targeted disables to stop you in your tracks, or can simply destroy the trees to reveal you for a unit-targeted disable.<br/><br/>Sprout provides flying vision within the ring, as well as in an area around it. This allows it to be used to give vision over obstacles such as high ground, or to completely reveal an area that an enemy may be trying to juke through to escape. In a pinch, it can also be used for de-warding by providing vision over elevated ward spots.<br/><br/>Sprout can be used to protect allies, not just to pin down enemies. If an ally is running away, casting Sprout in the enemy's path can block off their chase route, forcing them to path around to pursue. However, be extremely careful not to accidentally pen in allies with this spell, as you may accidentally secure a kill for the enemy instead.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that certain allied spells can be cast in tandem with Sprout to create extremely powerful combinations. For instance, Shackleshot can be virtually guaranteed to latch for its full duration, Mystic Flare can focus its full power on an immobilized target, Static Link and Eye of the Storm can run for a much longer duration, Timber Chain can be used to quickly move to a destination where there would normally not be trees, and so on. Be creative with how you use Sprout if a teammate can benefit from it.<br/><h4>Teleportation</h4>With one early skill point in this ability, Nature's Prophet gains tremendous global mobility. As the only constraint on this spell is the 3 second cast animation, he can appear anywhere on the map that he wishes. This allows Nature's Prophet to show up to ganks even if he's on the other side of the map, and possibly use Sprout to aid his teammates in disabling and focusing down an enemy.<br/><br/>Remember that this ability has a 3 second cast animation, and is not a channeled spell. This means that, at any time during the 3 second delay, you can cancel it and choose a different place to teleport to, without incurring the mana cost or cooldown. This can be used to fake out the enemy into maneuvering down a different path to avoid your arrival, to choose a different arrival point to better suit an evolving situation, and so on. However, beware that cancelling the animation means that you will delay your arrival by that much longer, which may result in you arriving too late to make a difference.<br/><br/>With good timing and possibly assisting ward vision, Teleportation can be used to kill the enemy's courier as it is en route to deliver items. This can be particularly effective if you can kill the courier before it can deliver a Bottle to the enemy's mid, giving your mid player a firm advantage. It is advised, however, to carry a Town Portal Scroll when attempting this, as you may require a speedy escape in order to avoid being caught and killed.<br/><br/>Judicious use of this ability is what makes Nature's Prophet such a powerful hero. If the enemy is seen using their Town Portal Scrolls to teleport to one lane, you can cast Teleportation to jump to another lane and then quickly push it and attempt to take a tower if the creep wave is close. If a low-HP enemy hero is seen retreating after an engagement, you can interdict them and kill them before they get back to their fountain. If an ally is engaging an enemy in a one-on-one fight and neither side has teammates nearby, you can teleport in to turn it into an uneven match and secure a kill. Proper use of this ability requires strong map awareness and good judgment.<br/><h4>Nature's Call</h4>Nature's Call allows Nature's Prophet to summon Treants to do his bidding. It is a very flexible spell that is most powerful in the early game, but requires good micromanagement in order to get the most benefit out of the ability.<br/><br/>Never underestimate the survivability of Treants in the laning stage of the game. They possess 550 HP at all points in the game, rivaling that of heroes in the beginning. As such, they can be used for multiple purposes such as scouting out pre-rune aggression, physically blocking enemy pull camps, and so on.<br/><br/>In general, Treants are used to assist Nature's Prophet in jungling in the early game, as they can deal additional damage to neutral camps while tanking creep attacks, keeping Nature's Prophet safe from harm; as such, it is generally the most important spell to max out in the early game. Remember to micromanage Treants so that they do not get killed by creeps, as even low-health Treants can still contribute attack damage to increase the rate of farming.<br/><br/>Treants can act as strong lane pushers past the early game. Not only can they add their attack power to a pushing creep wave, they can soak up tower hits and can be maneuvered to kite away approaching enemy creeps to delay defenders from arriving. They can also provide vision behind towers and around treelines to spot any enemy attempts to teleport in.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Nature's Call will destroy all trees in its area. This can be used to allow easier transit between neutral camps while jungling, destroying enemy juke paths, and so on. However, also remember that trees take 5 minutes to respawn after destruction, so it can be beneficial to target the spell such that only the minimum number of trees are destroyed per cast, in order to preserve some trees for later summons.<br/><br/>Trees created by Sprout are valid targets for Nature's Call. This means that should Nature's Prophet need reinforcements in an area outside of the jungle (such as pushing up the enemy's high ground or while within the enemy's base), casting Sprout first will allow him to summon Treants wherever they are needed.<br/><br/>Nature's Call can be used to great effect for scouting enemy player movement prior to the horn, particularly around the rune spots. Cast Nature's Call a bit after the minute mark (around 0:55 or 0:50), and then maneuver one Treant to the areas around each rune spot. While they cannot block the enemy from picking up the rune, they can scout out enemy positions, giving your team valuable intelligence and allow them to re-position to engage the enemy as needed. Be sure to maneuver the Treants and avoid feeding them to the enemy, as they do provide a small gold and experience bounty.<br/><br/>If your Treants are about to expire and cannot be readily used to farm another neutral camp, it can be useful to maneuver them to the rune spots prior to the even-minute mark. They can be used to scout out and guard the runes for your mid player, and under optimal circumstances can deny runes for the opposing mid player.<br/><br/>Treants become less effective as games progress, as they eventually become easy fodder for enemy heroes. However, they still provide useful service when utilized properly.<br/>As they are still treated as regular units, Treants can be used to frustrate enemy attempts at using their spells. For instance, they can physically block attempts to hit heroes with spells such as Meat Hook, Hookshot and Sacred Arrow, and can act as additional targets for random-target area spells such as Chain Frost, Rocket Barrage, Paralyzing Cask, Soul Catcher, and so on.<br/><br/>Treants can give vision and can be directly controlled, allowing them to be used to gather intelligence. They can scout out dangerous areas for enemy movement (such as checking behind treelines for hiding initiators), increase your vision radius at night by placing them at the outer perimeters of your team's location, look inside Roshan's pit, and so on.<br/><br/><h4>Wrath of Nature</h4>Generally, Wrath of Nature is best used to halt enemy pushes, or add an initiation nuke to a gank. It should generally not be used to farm lane creeps around the map every time it is off cooldown, as this can take away farm from teammates and push creep waves, giving teammates less safe places to farm.<br/><br/>Remember that Wrath of Nature deals more damage to the units hit at the end of its duration, so skillful use of this spell requires targeting it to land on as many units as possible prior to reaching your intended target, but without overrunning the unit cap. Watch your mini-map for how many possible targets there are currently, and cast the spell at the right moment. If your target is in the bottom lane, target the spell on the top lane to give it units to build up on, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Wrath of Nature can be used to effectively stall enemy pushes and give them pause. If the enemy is attempting to push a tower, using the spell can deal heavy damage to their creep wave and any heroes within vision, possibly killing their whole creep wave and preventing them from effectively pushing. To the same purpose, it can be used to push out lanes so that your team can more easily take towers.<br/><br/>Wrath of Nature can be useful for starting up a nuke prior to ganking an enemy. If cast right before initiating with Teleportation, it can hit enemy creeps to build up its damage before arriving at the gank target, striking them shortly before Nature's Prophet emerges.<br/><br/>With Aghanim's Scepter, the overall nuking power of Wrath of Nature increases, giving it a greater chance to kill any creep it strikes and summoning a Treant for every successful kill. This can greatly augment Nature's Prophet's ability to push, as every successful kill will also summon instant reinforcements for that lane to increase its pushing power.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve can provide health regeneration for Nature's Prophet in the early game as required. If jungling, one or both can be forgone in lieu of using Nature's Call to summon Treants to tank neutral creep attacks.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection can provide Nature's Prophet with some armor, increasing his survivability, and builds into Ring of Basilius.<br/><br/>At least two Clarity can help keep Nature's Prophet's mana topped up so he can continually use his spells in the early game, particularly Nature's Call, as his base intelligence and comparatively costly spells means that he will otherwise quickly run out.<br/><br/>Iron Branch are cheap attribute items that can shore up Nature's Prophet's stats in the early game. Any leftover gold can be spent giving him a bit more HP, base damage and mana.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick can be useful to purchase on Nature's Prophet if he is laning rather than jungling. The burst HP and mana regen can give him the survivability to escape an enemy gank, or enough mana to cast one more spell.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed provide Nature's Prophet with a boost to his movement speed, important for catching up to enemies to cast his spells during ganks. While he has strong global mobility in Teleportation, having enough speed to re-position during fights is crucial.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius provides Nature's Prophet with mana regeneration and an armor aura, which can increase the survivability of his Treants and lane creeps. This can help with jungling, and when pushing. If needed, it can be disassembled and the Sage's Mask recycled into another item, such as an Oblivion Staff for Orchid Malevolence.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand provide additional attribute bonuses to Nature's Prophet, and give him even more burst HP and mana regen. A fully-charged Magic Wand can give Nature's Prophet enough mana to cast any of his spells (short of a level 3 ultimate) even when completely empty.<br/><br/>Power Treads provide Nature's Prophet with a boost to his attributes and additional attack speed, which are both very useful. The attributes allow him to give himself more HP or mana and base damage, while the attack speed allows him to land more physical attacks on enemy targets.<br/><br/>Phase Boots is a useful alternative to Power Treads. As it augments Nature's Prophet's physical attacks and allows him to boost his movement speed, it can make him a bigger threat in ganks since he can maneuver into position more easily after casting Teleportation, to pen in an enemy with Sprout and deal heavily damaging right-clicks. The movement speed boost is also useful for escaping pursuing enemies, and in a pinch can be used to walk right through other units, such as your own Treants.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll significantly augments Nature's Prophet's global mobility. While Teleportation already grants him global presence without the need to target his destination at an allied building, a Town Portal Scroll allows him to use the two in tandem, such as retreating to base or defending a tower after using his innate spell. As well, using the Town Portal Scroll will leave Teleportation at the ready should an opportunity to gank an enemy present itself shortly.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Hand of Midas, if obtained early, can greatly augment Nature's Prophet's late-game potential by accelerating his gold and experience gain at the cost of early-game aggression. As well, the bonus attack speed give his physical attacks more power.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse massively increases the ganking power of Nature's Prophet by giving him a Hex ability, giving him another way to control enemies' movements on top of Sprout. It also provides a large increase to his intelligence, giving him more damage and mana, as well as all-around stats and powerful mana regeneration.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade gives Nature's Prophet more initiation and escape ability, augmenting his already formidable global presence due to Teleportation. Used offensively, Nature's Prophet can get in a powerful first strike on unwary enemies prior to disabling and focusing them down. Used defensively, the invisibility and increased movement speed allow him to evade any enemy rotations aimed at halting his pushes, and can allow him to invisibly cast Teleportation.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter augments the strength of Wrath of Nature, allowing it to deal more damage overall and sprouting Treants upon successfully killing an enemy unit, be it a creep or hero. This greatly augments Nature's Prophet's pushing power, since it will summon reinforcements upon striking down enemy lane creeps.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence is a powerful early aggression tool. Its low cost and easy buildup make it possible to obtain quickly in the early game, while the bonuses it provides augment Nature's Prophet's physical attacks (via increased intelligence, damage and attack speed) and allow him to gank enemies to great effect by silencing them, preventing them from casting retaliatory disables or escape spells. The augmented mana regen also allows him to stay out in the field longer without needing to return to base as often.<br/><br/>Desolator can greatly augment Nature's Prophet's offensive and pushing potential. The increased damage and armor reduction on targets make his physical attacks much deadlier, allowing him to soften up gank targets or reduce tower armor to hasten pushes.<br/><br/>Necronomicon provides Nature's Prophet with additional pushing power and an additional damage source when ganking enemy heroes. At level 3, the Necronomicon will also provide True Sight, which can be used to de-ward enemy vision and prevent invisible enemy heroes from escaping ganks.<br/><br/>Daedalus provides Nature's Prophet with tremendously increased attack damage and a critical strike, allowing him to deal more damage to enemy heroes. It is primarily purchased with the intent to kill heroes rather than destroy towers, and can make him a force to be reckoned with when combined with his potent disables.<br/><br/>Mekansm can be a strong utility item to build on Nature's Prophet. His global presence allows him to use this item to save allies when teleporting to their aid during an enemy gank, and can also be used to heal allied creep waves to augment their pushing power.<br/><br/>Silver Edge, when upgraded from Shadow Blade, can give Nature's Prophet additional ganking power when used properly. By applying a break on gank targets, enemy passives can be removed from play, increasing the odds of a successful kill. As well, the damage reduction it inflicts upon the hit enemy and the bonus stats give Nature's Prophet increased resilience.<br/><br/>Null Talisman provides cheap stats, and improves Nature's Prophet's mana pool and damage output, making early jungling easier. Purchasing two or more can give him respectable early stats and allow him to fight enemies earlier on.<br/><br/>Force Staff can be a useful item to purchase on Nature's Prophet, depending on the situation. It can enhance his mobility by allowing him to quickly re-position himself, such as pushing himself over a cliff, re-positioning allies, or breaking Linken's Sphere on a gank target prior to other disables.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger can tremendously increase Nature's Prophet's maneuverability and ability to evade enemy ganks. After using Teleportation to arrive at a lane and Nature's Call to summon Treants to push, Blink Dagger can be used to instantly jump away to evade any enemies attempting to rotate in. It can also be used to initiate more easily on gank targets, as they may easily run away if they see a Teleportation coming in.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is a very unorthodox early-game item to build on Nature's Prophet, as he does not have the HP to efficiently utilize any reflected damage. However, it can be a powerful offensive item, as it provides a large amount of attack damage and intelligence, tremendously increasing the power of his right-click damage. As well, the armor increases his survivability and the active can still be useful when focusing down single targets, and any damage incurred can be replenished by returning to the fountain with Teleportation.<br/><br/>Dagon gives Nature's Prophet significantly more ganking power as he can instantly burst down a portion a gank target's HP, making successful kills more likely. His ability to farm and get kills also allows him to upgrade it to allow it to remain potent throughout a match.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is a very powerful offensive and pushing item. By boosting his attack speed and inflicting the enemy with a negative armor aura, Nature's Prophet's physical attacks become much deadlier, and the increased armor also gives him survivability against physical damage. As well, the negative armor aura affects enemy buildings as well as creeps, and the allied aura increases creep armor and attack speed, making pushes more powerful when outside of teamfights.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar should be purchased if an enemy is building evasion items, as it allows Nature's Prophet to gank them without worrying about missing attacks. As well, the item gives him generally increased damage output and attack speed, allowing him to push more effectively.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is a strong all-around pushing and fighting item. The greatly increased attack speed as well as attack modifier allows Nature's Prophet to make short work of creep waves, and increases the potency of his attacks during ganks and teamfights. The active can be cast to increase damage output via proccing the shield.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is a situationally powerful casting item on Nature's Prophet, depending on the enemy lineup. While the spell lifesteal is not very beneficial due to Wrath of Nature being his only innate damage nuke, the cooldown reduction allows him to summon Treants more frequently, re-position around the map more often with Teleportation, and theoretically keep up a permanent Sprout on an enemy (excluding cast animation).<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Necrophos is a highly survivable intelligence hero whose power scale with how long he survives in a fight and eventually how long the game becomes due to his capability of taking out crucial targets and pro-longing their death with his ultimate Reaper's Scythe. Despite having a heal in his kit, Necrophos is not supportive by nature and should not be used as one as for a support, healing is all he can contribute and he is not that good at it.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deceptively durable when played correctly.<br/><br/>Very effective in any teamfight, especially long ones.<br/><br/>Fairly straightforward with his spells, making him easy to play.<br/><br/>Can lengthen respawn times of key enemy Heroes, or those that bought back.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Slightly item dependent.<br/><br/>Not naturally durable.<br/><br/>Not too reliable escape mechanism.<br/><br/>Sluggish movement speed.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Necrophos is countered in lane by any hero with high health regeneration, such as Dragon Knight and Quas-focused Invoker, or a hero with lifesteal capabilities; because he relies on inflicting constant, gradual damage with Death Pulse and Heartstopper Aura. Heroes with these attributes will resist this in lane against Necrophos, keeping high enough health to prevent death by Reaper's Scythe.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb combined with an Aghanim's Scepter will greatly increase your chance at winning the match if it reaches the late game. If you manage to kill 2 enemy heroes in succession, the sheer duration of their respawn time might be enough to decide the match, more so if the victims are key heroes in their lineup.<br/><br/>Necrophos can very easily be built as a tank and in most circumstances should be; you may gear for strength (he does not need excessive intelligence as his basic attacks are not too useful, and Death Pulse refunds mana for each kill he gets). The reason he is usually built as a tank is because he needs to stay alive in violent encounters to heal his allies (a good enemy team will focus him first), and also because the longer he is alive for, the more damage his aura will do and the better chance he has of landing a crucial Reaper's Scythe.<br/><br/>Although it may be wise to build some mana pool increasing items such as Arcane Boots, Point Booster or other Intelligence items may do so anyway; because if Necrophos has used all his abilities and failed to get a kill, he would wind up and be unable to cast any more of his spells. Moreover, if his auto attack is not too great, getting last hits to regenerate some mana can be problematic.<br/>Utility items, such as Mekansm, Pipe of Insight and Guardian Greaves are more useful for Necrophos, because he can inflict constant damage with Heartstopper Aura simply by avoiding death and synergizes with his Death Pulse to keep his team alive. In that sense, Crimson Guard is also a viable luxury item for Utility Necrophos as it will greatly increase his durability while also providing a useful team ability.<br/><br/><br/>Radiance is a viable item for Necrophos because of his durability. This also synergizes well with Heartstopper Aura making prolonged team-fights a dangerous prospect for the enemy team.<br/><br/>Necrophos is effective against invisible heroes that tend to stalk their prey as his Heartstopper Aura does damage while they are in stealth, his Death Pulse hits invisible units, and his Reaper's Scythe will prevent them from escaping via invisibility before they die. He is also very good against heroes with abilities that deplete their own health such as Pudge, Slark, and Centaur Warrunner ( Huskar is an exception since his Berserker's Blood will almost always prevent you from killing him with Reaper's Scythe), but Necrophos should first be durable enough to take on these kinds of risk/reward heroes.<br/><br/>Necrophos' role is notoriously debated; while his abilities appear supportive at their core, his Reaper's Scythe is a tool used to secure kills only for himself (much like Axe's Culling Blade). This is atypical for a standard support hero, because supports usually attempt to confer gold and experience to the team's carry. The duplicity of his carry/support role stems from his unique stance in encounters; his kit is largely supportive until an enemy hero grows weak, at which point Necrophos has the capacity to kill said enemy himself. He is best viewed as a utility focused semi-carry, rather than a full-fledged support hero.<br/><br/>Dagon is more useful on Necrophos than other heroes because it not only deals burst damage, but also allows you to quickly deal more damage from your ultimate.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade can be used in conjunction with Reaper's Scythe and Death Pulse to deal significantly more damage. If you are also in a possession of a high level Dagon, a quick Reaper's Scythe to Ether Blast to Energy Burst combo can decimate full health enemy heroes with total health points lower than 2000, assuming they have the standard 25% magic resistance.<br/>It is worth noting that Ether Blast temporarily increases the magical damage dealt per missing health from the standard 0.4/0.6/0.9 to 0.56/0.84/1.26, thus also increases the instant-kill threshold.<br/><br/>Assuming a level 5 Energy Burst and a level 3 Reaper's Scythe with an Aghanim's Scepter is used against an enemy with 25% magic resistance while being ethereal, you will deal 840 damage from Dagon and 1058.4 damage from Reaper's Scythe, to a total of 1898.4 damage (not including damage from Ether Blast and Reaper's Scythe damage due to it). If the match reaches the late-game, you still can burst down a full health non-magic-immune enemy carry with standard magic resistance during teamfights, potentially turning it into your team's favor.<br/><br/><br/>Octarine Core is a viable item if you plan to do an aggressive approach as your Death Pulse will heal Necrophos for 130 + 50 per hero hit and reduce its cooldown to 3.75 seconds. If you also manage to kill an enemy with Reaper's Scythe, the massive damage coupled with the heal from Death Pulse will in some cases be enough to heal Necrophos from critically low health to full health. However, it is advised that you build a Bloodstone too because the Octarine Core will increase your mana consumption and is a lot less effective than Bloodstone at restoring mana.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Death Pulse</h4>As Necrophos's survivability heavily relies on his ability to spam Death Pulse you need to be wary of heroes with silence such as Drow Ranger, Silencer and Death Prophet. Ancient Apparition can also greatly cripple you with Ice Blast as this ability prevents health from regenerating for an extended period of time.<br/><br/>With a Bloodstone, he can keep the pressure up at the enemy lanes and prevent the enemy team from farming. If you can get it early enough, you can choose to build it before Mekansm and/or Pipe of Insight because it will drastically improve your survivability and so that you can store enough charges.<br/><br/>The passive portion of the ability applies to and is triggered by any kills made by Necrophos. The killing blow does not need to be with Death Pulse specifically.<br/><h4>Ghost Shroud</h4>Ghost Shroud applies an Ethereal status, disarming and rendering Necrophos unable to perform basic attacks.<br/>Spells and abilities that apply a similar Ethereal status does not multiplicatively stack with one another, and only the strongest spell-resistance reducing modifier is applied.<br/><br/>Ghost Shroud shields you entirely from physical damage, but increases your vulnerability to magical damage. Be wary of the circumstances before casting this spell.<br/><br/><br/>Any form of health and mana recovery is amplified, so it works with the health and mana restoration of spells like Shadow Wave and items like Arcane Boots.<br/>Ghost Shroud only amplifies any health and mana restoration that Necrophos receives from all sources and does not actually amplify the health and mana restoration of his other spells.<br/>This means that while under the effects of Ghost Shroud, Death Pulse will have a greater healing effect upon Necrophos, but Death pulse itself is not amplified and will not heal allies for a greater amount than stated in the spell description.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ghost Shroud applies an area move speed slow centred around Necrophos, similar to Degen Aura, making it a good skill to chase down heroes or to impede their own chasing efforts upon you or your allies.<br/><br/>Ghost Shroud is immediately dispelled when Necrophos is rendered spell immune, so it cannot be used in conjunction with Repel or Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Items and spells can be used and activated without causing Ghost Shroud to be dispelled (with the exception of Black King Bar).<br/><h4>Heartstopper Aura</h4>Heartstopper Aura in the early game allows Necrophos to harass enemy heroes by simply standing near them. Its massive radius will usually cause heroes to run out of their early game regeneration items quite fast.<br/>Note however that the aura affects enemy creeps, and thus putting points in it will push the lane. Should you lane with a farm-dependent carry, it is unwise to push as it makes their farm more difficult and leaves both of you more vulnerable to ganks. Putting one or at the most two points in it is appropriate for early game.<br/><br/><br/>If you're against a defensive tri-lane or playing as an Offlaner and the enemies in the lane lack disables, maxing Heartstopper Aura first is a viable option if the enemy chooses to play passively. The massive degeneration will make it hard for the enemy to farm and in some cases they might ignore Necrophos until it is too late and their health is low enough for a kill with Reaper's Scythe or make them vulnerable to a gank. The same can be said if you are in a defensive trilane and the enemy has a tanky offlaner.<br/><br/>Don't neglect to use basic attacks to harass the enemy during laning phase. Heartstopper Aura already negates their regeneration or at least hinder it significantly if they bought/rushed health regen items like Ring of Regen and Ring of Health in anticipation. Even attacking them once in a while goes a long way because they can't readily recuperate the loss of health and will eventually force them to use their consumables or retreat.<br/><br/>If you are going for an early push strategy, an early Headdress in conjunction with your aura will work wonders and will make the lane a battle of attrition that they will lose from either using too much regen items or being too afraid to last hit. Unless of course, they have a naturally high health regen.<br/><br/>Due to the large range of Heartstopper Aura, heroes that practice Armlet of Mordiggian toggling will be forced to stop toggling below 450 health at teamfights as turning off Unholy Strength will reduce their health to 1 and will die from Heartstopper Aura immediately after. If you are also a support and is not hard pressed to last hit, the range will also allow you to hide in trees to harass the enemy heroes in the lane without them knowing.<br/><h4>Reaper's Scythe</h4>At level 3, Reaper's Scythe will kill targets at 40% or less health. Remember to factor in magic resistance from items and abilities before you attempt to execute an enemy Hero with it.<br/>The Reaper's Scythe instant-kill health threshold, with the base 25% magic resist factored in, can be calculated by multiplying the enemy max health with the constants: 3/13, 9/29, or 27/67 for each respective level of the ultimate.<br/><br/><br/>The philosophy behind Reaper's Scythe is that (owing to Death Pulse) it will return its mana expenditure if you secure a kill.<br/>Due to the damage mechanics of the spell, many player would preferably want to secure a kill in order to recoup the mana spent in casting it. However, there are several situations in which this ability should be used purely for its stun, such as interrupting channeled ultimates (such as those belonging to Pudge or Enigma) or preventing an enemy hero from escaping.<br/>Take note that the stun goes through magic immunity, although the damage will not.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Keep in mind that Reaper's Scythe is not a channeling ability, meaning you can move the moment you have cast it. As such, it can be used to escape ganks and chases.<br/>Because you can cast during the stun, you can use it to initiate on an enemy hero to keep them from escaping or using Black King Bar assuming you can cause enough damage in 1.5 seconds. You can instant-kill with this tactic if you are paired with a high burst damage hero such as Huskar or Lina or Lion, or if you are in possession of a high level Dagon and an Ethereal Blade.<br/><br/><br/>Remember that this ultimate adds additional time to its victim's respawn timer In later stages of the game this can prove very important in removing key enemy heroes from the fight for a very long time.<br/>If the situation permits, you should focus on using Reaper's Scythe only on the same enemy (preferably the carry) throughout the match. The extension of the respawn time will add up and will cause a significant reduction to the enemy's farm. To put it into perspective, if you manage to kill the same enemy hero twice, it will already make their farm a minute late more than usual if killed by anybody else. This will cause heroes who depend on snowballing early like Pudge to become almost useless in mid to late game as their chance to snowball will be greatly reduced, or make the enemy carry under-prepared to tackle your team's carry hero.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Iron Branches give nice, cheap bonuses and can be used to build a Magic Wand or a Mekansm later.<br/><br/>Clarity to keep being able to cast Death Pulse when needed.<br/><br/>Mantle of Intelligence gives a little boost to Necrophos' mana pool.<br/><br/>Healing Salve and a set of Tangos make you much more durable in lane. Use these items rather than your Death Pulse if you wish to heal yourself without wasting mana and pushing the lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is bought because of the regeneration it provides against enemies who spam their spells. It's also used to make a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed make you go faster and can be upgraded.<br/><br/>Headdress gives more attributes and more health regeneration. It's used to make a Mekansm.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand provides you with attributes and a useful ability to regenerate mana and health.<br/><br/>Power Treads give you more durability if left on Strength, or more mana if switched to Intelligence. The attack speed makes it easier for you to weaken an enemy, and then kill him with Reaper's Scythe.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter reduces the cooldown of Reaper's Scythe dramatically, while giving nice attributes, health, and mana.<br/><br/>Point Booster gives you some very cost and slot-effective health and mana. It can then be left as a stand-alone item (a "casual" point booster) or be used to build an Aghanim's Scepter or a Soul Booster, which can then be built into either a Bloodstone or an Octarine Core.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is a casual purchasable for every hero, whether to escape a gank or assist in one.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger solve his mobility problem and will allow you to hide before entering teamfights as to not be initiated on by the other team since Necrophos would probably be the first target because of his sustain and proper positioning could make the difference between saving one of your team mates or being able to cast Reaper's Scythe on the enemy carry. It will also allow you to play more aggressively and give you a proper escape mechanism instead of just walking away.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Force Staff may be a better alternative, as it gives Intelligence (therefore, more mana), a little bit more regeneration to help with sustaining yourself, and gives a quick method of movement even while under attack. Other uses also involve using it on allies to save them, or on ill-positioned enemies to perhaps push them closer to your team (or yourself) to be focused on.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is also highly viable for Necrophos. It gives stats that Necrophos very much needs: Health, Intelligence, and a long range slow with a short cooldown, allowing you and your team to catch up and let you cast your Reaper's Scythe, or make the hero stay within Heartstopper Aura longer which all can possibly secure you a kill. The active also can be used for escape or even buy enough time for your other abilities to be off cooldown or your teammate to arrive.<br/><br/>Blade Mail can be a wise choice if Necrophos already has other items to make him more lasting in teamfights. It gives a little boost of Intelligence, more Armor to add to your durability, and since Necrophos might usually need to be in the middle of everything, the active can dissuade enemies from focusing you down, giving them the risk of putting themselves in range for your ultimate.<br/><br/>Mekansm grants more attributes, more armor, and more health regeneration, making you harder to kill. Its active ability is useful both for supporting and to save yourself from danger.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves would be the better choice for supporting your team since you would have already built a Mekansm. Along with Death Pulse, keeping your team alive will be considerably easier as well as providing mana. Consider building Arcane Boots instead of Power Treads if you are planning to build this.<br/><br/>Bloodstone makes you tankier and gives much more mana, making you almost unkillable and able to spam your Death Pulse if you stay behind your allies, thanks to the regeneration it provides.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives good attributes and mana regeneration. Its disable makes it easier to kill a powerful carry or an annoying support/initiator.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard is a good item for teamfights: the armor and the aura it provides will discourage the enemy carry from attacking you, while its active ability places a slowing debuff on enemies, so that you'll be able to chase them and finish them off more easily.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight gives much more health regeneration and increases your magic resistance. Its ability is useful if the enemy team has a great initiator: with this item you'll be able to partially counter him.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque makes you a lot more tanky, increasing your health by 1150 health. A very important item to obtain if the enemy has highly mobile heroes who also deal high damage, as it will allow you to sustain their attacks for longer giving you a better chance of escaping.<br/><br/>Radiance synergizes well with Heartstopper Aura. Acquiring this will make your presence very strong during teamfights and help keep your lanes clear of enemy creeps due to the combined pure and magic damage. The 17% miss debuff is also a nice compliment to your already dangerous being.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel can be bought to make you faster and able to push the lanes more effectively, thanks to your Death Pulse.<br/><br/>Octarine Core lowers the cooldown of Reaper's Scythe, allowing for more frequent kills and more downtime for the enemy team. In conjunction with Ghost Shroud when activated, it provides a potentially large heal for the kills with Reaper's Scythe and makes Death's Pulse's healing more effective, immensely increasing Necrophos' longevity. If purchased with Radiance, you can even heal every second.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb should be picked up if Necrophos finds himself to be a high priority target for the enemy. Since Necrophos is commonly built to be durable, he will be frequently seen in the front lines, thus letting Lotus Orb be used to its full potential.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Ogre Magi is the embodiment of "dumb muscle". While having a meager mana pool for an intelligence hero, his health pool can become one of the largest in the game. Not needing very many items, Ogre is potent at all points in the game, being able to easily trade hits early on, burst foes in the mid game, and help with late game pushes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Has the third highest Strength gain at 3.2 per level, with 23 base strength.<br/><br/>Second highest base armor at 8<br/><br/>Has a stun and a slow in his kit<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Second lowest base intelligence and third lowest intelligence gain<br/><br/>Slow movement speed with no mobility skills<br/><br/>One of the few melee intelligence heroes<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Take advantage of Ogre's tankiness early on. Trade hits with enemies while taking very little damage yourself<br/><br/>Once your lane partner is safe for a little bit, go gank other lanes. Your stun and slow should make getting kills really easy<br/><br/>Manage your mana. Ogre can run out really quickly if you're not careful, so try not to use more than is needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fireblast</h4>Use this to stop foes from escaping or channeling spells. Follow up with Ignite to ensure your allies can catch up to the target.<br/>Alternatively, consider casting Ignite first to slow you opponents down in order for you to catch up and follow-up with Fireblast, as Ignite has a much greater cast range than Fireblast.<br/><br/><br/>If Multicast procs, it increases the damage and the stun duration. At 4x multicast it essentially doubles the stun from 1.5 seconds to 3 seconds.<br/><br/>With 0/1/2/3 points in Multicast, Fireblast will deal on average 220/308/418/544.5 damage (before spell amp and magic resistance).<br/><br/>Be wary of your mana consumption once you start having levels in Multicast, as each level of Multicast increases the mana cost of Fireblast.<br/><h4>Do not discount the damage done by Ignite, as it has the potential to deal heavy damage (400 at maximum level) in an area once Multicast is learnt, making it a very good pushing/counter-pushing skill.</h4>BloodlustBloodlust works best if you cast it onto your carry before a fight begins to give them a decent attack and movement speed boost.<br/><br/>Bloodlust can be used to help you and your allies escape with the bonus movement speed.<br/><br/>Bloodlust can be cast on towers to increase the odds of them killing low health enemies who are in the radius of the tower.<br/><br/>Bloodlust will be cast on random allies in the vicinity if Multicast procs. Additionally, each point in Multicast also lowers the cooldown, making it easier to keep it up on everyone.<br/>Targets are chosen at random, so Heroes are not prioritised when Multicast procs.<br/><br/><br/>Bloodlust will target nearby Heroes automatically if set on autocast. Be careful of your mana usage, as with the low cooldown period, you may inadvertently find yourself out of mana in a crucial moment.<br/>Bloodlust will only be automatically cast is your allies do not currently have the Bloodlust buff on them.<br/><br/>Autocast will interrupt your current queue order, but will not cause you to disengage a channeling ability.<br/><br/><h4>Bloodlust works best if you cast it onto your carry before a fight begins to give them a decent attack and movement speed boost.</h4>MulticastGives passive changes to all of Magi's abilities minus Unrefined Fireblast.<br/>Fireblast has its mana cost increased by 20/40/60 and cooldown lowered by 2/4/6 per level.<br/><br/>Ignite is given 150/300/450 AoE and casting range increase.<br/><br/>Bloodlust gets a 5/10/15 second cooldown reduction.<br/><br/><br/>Gives additional effects to all of Ogre's abilities that stack based on how much Multicast procced.<br/>Fireblast and Unrefined Fireblast both indirectly gain increased damage and stun through multiple cast of the spell.<br/><br/>Ignite can jump to nearby enemies.<br/><br/>Bloodlust is cast on nearby allies.<br/><br/><h4>Gives passive changes to all of Magi's abilities minus Unrefined Fireblast.</h4>Unrefined FireblastEssentially the same as Fireblast but with a different mana cost mechanic.<br/>Unrefined Fireblast has a naturally higher damage and lower cooldown than Fireblast.<br/><br/><br/>Does not need Multicast leveled, but does need Aghanim's Scepter to unlock and use.<br/><br/>Always uses 60% of your current mana, meaning it's most effective when used when almost out of mana instead of when you're nearly at full mana.<br/>Because of this, you can also always use this ability no matter how low your mana is.<br/><br/>Be careful of your mana usage when you cast this at full mana, as it will severely deplete your mana pool and limit your other spellcasting and item usage.<br/><br/><br/>With 0/1/2/3 points in Multicast, Unrefined Fireblast will deal on average 275/385/522.5/680.6 damage (before spell amp and magic resistance).<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Animal Courier should be bought as you do not need very many items.<br/><br/>Enchanted Mango gives you mana on demand and a slight increase in health regen to keep you healthy in the lane.<br/><br/>Tango gives you additional regen so you don't have to leave lane as often.<br/><br/>Clarity potions allow for a few extra casts of your spells.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early items:</b><br/>Orb of Venom increases the damage you do while zoning enemies and makes it harder for them to run away from you.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are mandatory on any hero, Ogre being no exception.<br/><br/>Magic Stick helps to supplement your low mana pool for more spell casts; it can also be turned into a Magic Wand later on.<br/><br/>Your relative independence from reliance on items to be effective makes you a good candidate for buying Observer Wards.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots give you plenty of mana for all of your spells, and also help more mana-hungry teammates.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord improves your armor and health regen even more, gives you much needed stats, and amplifies your as well as your teammates' spell damage.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter not only gives you a good attribute increase, but also increases your nuking and disabling power in the form of Unrefined Fireblast.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Soul Ring can be picked up in lane to provide additional mana on demand, and Ogre's high health pool for an intelligence hero lowers the risk of using this.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows should be heavily considered if getting a lot of roaming kills early on.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance gives decent attributes for its low cost. The extra movement speed also stacks with Bloodlust.<br/><br/>Force Staff gives Ogre much needed mobility to keep with foes or escape from fights, as well as slightly increasing your mana pool.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives you additional movement speed, good intelligence and mana regen, and an active that can be used for chasing, escaping, or locking someone out of a fight.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter lets you avoid dying quickly to heavily physical attack-reliant enemies later on in the game, and also gives some minor attributes.<br/><br/>Aether Lens increase the casting range of all of your abilities and items, meaning you can stay in the back of fights and cast spells, gives you even more mana, and increases your spell damage slightly.<br/><br/>Octarine Core, while expensive, will make Ogre a beast to take down. The spell lifesteal means as long as you cast spells on enemies that's more health they have to go through, it gives you a huge amount of health and mana, and it lowers the cooldown on your abilities even more.<br/><br/>Bloodstone pretty much makes mana a non-issue on Ogre and tanks him up, but it is really hard to build quickly on him, especially if played as a support.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives you even more AoE slow in fights and increases your already high armor to phenomenal levels. In addition, the bonus intelligence increases your mana and spell damage by a decent amount.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives you an additional disable, plenty of attributes, and plenty of mana regeneration.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Oracle is a versatile spell caster whose spells can be used defensively or offensively depending on how the combinations of spells are used. A well timed ultimate can change a surprise attack from the enemy into a failed gank. Oracle is not very mobile and is susceptible to getting picked or focused first in fights if poorly positioned.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong spammable nukes<br/><br/>Great spell utility, Fate's Edict can be used to negate magical damage or disarm opponents for example.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Lacks any strong area of effect spells<br/><br/>Inexperienced players might cause more harm than good to their team or aid the enemy if they cast the wrong spells at the wrong time<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Oracle's strength lies not in his individual spells, but in how he utilizes his spells in combination with each other, as well as those of his teammates. This means that playing Oracle effectively requires communication and coordination with allied players, as well as good reflexes and knowledge of what each ability does.<br/><br/>Like most other intelligence supports, Oracle suffers from poor strength and agility, making him extremely vulnerable to any types of damage. Because of his array of abilities, Oracle should build items that provide mobility rather than survivability, since he can use mobility items both to position himself for casting his spells and to escape enemy attempts to kill him. As well, his heavy reliance on spell casting means that he should invest in increasing the size of his mana pool and acquiring a reliable source of mana replenishment.<br/><br/>Be mindful that while Oracle has strong healing and nuking abilities, he possesses no hard disables, meaning that he is unable to interrupt channeling items/abilities, nor is he able to prevent enemies from casting spells or using items. In order to counter enemy spell and item usage, Oracle must himself purchase items to allow him to hard-disable the enemy, or rely on his allies to do so.<br/><br/>Oracle's spells all have very high cast ranges, and his good base movement speed allows him to get into position to use his spells relatively easily. However, his extremely low turn rate means that he cannot maneuver as easily as other heroes, so his ability to turn around to cast spells in surprise situations may allow the enemy to catch him off-guard. This means that prior knowledge of the enemy's positions and movements can allow him to orient himself to face the threat axis and be ready to use his spells immediately, making ward vision very important.<br/><br/>With his long attack range, respectable cast animation, and extremely low base attack time, Oracle is a very powerful harasser in the laning stage, able to inflict harass damage on enemy heroes safely and frequently, as well as deny effectively with his respectable base damage. Combined with his array of impact-heavy abilities and high base movement speed, this allows Oracle to be a very strong lane support who can very easily protect his safe lane carry.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fortune's End</h4>Fortune's End is a channeled nuke that damages enemies in an area around the target, while purging them and immobilizing them based on the channel duration.<br/><br/>Because its damage and cooldown scale as it is leveled up, Fortune's End is a good spell to max out early in the game. Leveling up the ability increases Oracle's ability to nuke and disable enemies, and the dispel has strong utility depending on the types of buffs that the enemy is depending on.<br/><br/>Fortune's End is a very flexible nuke that can be used in a number of ways. Chief among its utility is to deal nuke damage to an enemy while removing buffs, or to stop an enemy for the channeled duration as a follow-up disable from an allied initiation.<br/><br/>Be mindful that no matter how long Fortune's End is channeled, it will deal the same amount of damage regardless. Channeling Fortune's End for a longer duration only increases the amount of time that affected enemies are immobilized, so if the aim of casting the spell is to simply deal damage and/or purge rather than disable, the spell can be immediately released in order to give the enemy less time to react.<br/><br/>With regards to the immobilization, keep in mind that it is not a root, and therefore will not prevent the enemy from casting escape/survivability spells. However, it will forcibly reduce the target's movement speed to 0, which allows it to affect enemies in different ways (similar to Kinetic Field). This makes it a strong chasing and immobilizing spell as it takes priority over haste abilities such as Stampede and Shapeshift.<br/><br/>Never discount the area purging and immobilizing that Fortune's End can provide. If the spell can land on a clumped up group of enemies, the amount of damage it deals increases severalfold, along with purging many more buffs from the enemy and pinning them down for follow-up area disables by teammates.<br/><br/>Be careful about using Fortune's End as an initiating disable. Because the enemy can see the spell effects even if Oracle himself is not visible, they will immediately know that they are being targeted by the spell, and can immediately retreat to avoid being caught in a disadvantageous position, or easily disjoint the projectile.<br/><br/>Unlike most other purging-type spells, Fortune's End can still target invulnerable units (it is still blocked by spell immunity, however). This makes it a very powerful ability since it can forcibly remove certain instances of invulnerability, particularly a self-cast Eul's Scepter of Divinity.<br/><h4>Fate's Edict</h4>Fate's Edict inflicts its target with a disarm while increasing their magic resistance to 100%. It can be cast on allies and enemies alike.<br/><br/>Because its duration only scales by 0,5 second for each level, Fate's Edict is best left at level 1 until both Fortune's End and Purifying Flames are maxed out. However, its strong utility means that an early value point can be very strong as it greatly synergizes with Oracle's other spells.<br/><br/>Generally, Fate's Edict has two primary purposes: protecting allies from magic nukes, or disarming enemies to prevent them from attacking.<br/>Casting Fate's Edict on fleeing allies can save them from incoming magic nukes, particularly long-ranged single-shot ones like Assassinate and Thundergod's Wrath, and can be used to mitigate the effects damage-over-time debuffs such as Ice Blast and Poison Nova. Properly used, Fate's Edict can allow Oracle to defy his allies' fates by preventing their deaths due to magical damage.<br/><br/>Casting Fate's Edict on enemies during a fight can render them unable to attack, important for stopping their right-click carries from attacking. If the enemy does not have any dispel abilities or items, a good Fate's Edict can render their carry unable to attack for a period of time, greatly increasing the odds of winning a teamfight.<br/><br/><br/>Be very careful about when you cast Fate's Edict on an ally or enemy. Using the ability on an ally in the middle of a fight can prevent them from attacking, hindering their ability to kill enemies, while using it on an enemy can shield them from incoming allied magic nukes. Use your best judgment as to when Fate's Edict can be most profitably used, as casting it on the wrong target at the wrong time can reduce your team's chances at emerging victorious in an engagement.<br/><br/>It is possible to manually remove Fate's Edict from an enemy via the use of Fortune's End. If an enemy affected by Fate's Edict is fleeing and needs to be finished off with magic nukes, casting Fortune's End on them will remove it from them, while dealing nuke damage and immobilizing them to allow allies to follow up.<br/><br/>Fate's Edict can also be used as a simple magic resistance buff on allies that do not rely on auto-attacks to be effective. For instance, casting Fate's Edict can allow a teammate to walk into an active Freezing Field to cast an interrupting disable, or ignore most of Leshrac's damage output while directly engaging him with spells.<br/><br/>The magic resistance of Fate's Edict can synergize greatly with many other effects in the game.<br/>An ally affected by Cold Embrace is immune to physical damage but can still be bursted down by Magical and Pure. Casting Fate's Edict on the target can shield them from magic nukes for the duration of the disable, and the disarm can be neglected due to the target being unable to act anyways.<br/><br/>Any form of ethereal will leave its target unable to attack or be affected by physical damage, but decreases their magic resistance at the same time. Casting Fate's Edict in such a situation would render them invulnerable to magical damage as well, and the target will have already been disarmed by the ethereal form.<br/><br/><h4>Purifying Flames</h4>Purifying Flames is an extremely low cooldown magic nuke that applies a healing buff to its target. It can be cast on allies and enemies.<br/><br/>As a multipurpose heal and nuke, Purifying Flames is a very powerful spell to max out first. Its damage scales much higher than Fortune's End, and the heal can be very powerful at all points in the game.<br/><br/>Oracle's greatest strength is his ability to combine Purifying Flames with his other abilities, using them to completely change how it benefits his team and debilitates the enemy.<br/>The 100% magic resistance element of Fate's Edict can be used to great effect when combined with Purifying Flames. Casting Fate's Edict on an ally first, followed by Purifying Flames, will cause allies to take no damage from the nuke portion, and benefit only from the healing portion. As Purifying Flames can be stacked, higher levels of Fate's Edict allows Oracle to heal allies for larger amounts of HP per cast.<br/><br/>Fortune's End can purge positive buffs from enemies, Purifying Flames included. Casting Purifying Flames on an enemy first, then hitting them with Fortune's End, will cause them to be healed for the minimal amount of HP while taking the full brunt of the nuke damage from both spells.<br/><br/><br/>Be wary that the damage portion of Purifying Flames will always take magic resistance into account, whether it is cast on an ally or enemy. This means that unless the target is inflicted with powerful magic resistance debuffs, they will always be healed for more HP than the damage taken. This means that abilities such as Spell Shield and Berserker's Blood can greatly mitigate the nuke portion of Purifying Flames, which can be a boon or a hindrance depending on which team possesses either hero.<br/><br/>The short cooldown and small mana cost on Purifying Flames allows it to be used as a basic nuke. This can be used either to finish off low-health enemies, or score easy last-hits. Beware, however, that unless the target is killed quickly, they can eventually heal up a large amount of HP, which may necessitate the use of Fortune's End.<br/><br/>When using Purifying Flames in combination with Fortune's End to nuke enemies, keep in mind that Fortune's End has a travel time, while Purifying Flames will instantly apply its effects at the end of its cast animation. Start the attack, wait for the projectile to appear, and with the right timing of Purifying Flames the nuke will hit just before the projectile lands. Or, if an enemy is within range of Purifying Flames but is more than 400 range away, Fortune's End can be channeled first and then interrupted with Purifying Flames; the enemy will take the damage from Purifying Flames during the travel time of Fortune's End, and then immediately have the healing buff removed and be nuked by Fortune's End.<br/><br/>Purifying Flames, by itself, will never be lethal to allies. This allows Oracle to save time by directly casting Purifying Flames on a low-health ally rather than consuming time and mana with Fate's Edict first. However, be sure to check for damage over time debuffs first, and never do this if an enemy is nearby, as it can put teammates low enough for the enemy to easily finish off.<br/><br/>As with Fate's Edict, Purifying Flames can be used to great effect depending on what heroes are present on Oracle's team.<br/>In the case of an ally being shielded by Cold Embrace and Fate's Edict, Purifying Flames can be added on top to further magnify the healing effect of Cold Embrace, significantly boosting the amount of HP healed inside of a few seconds.<br/><br/>If the enemy has been affected by Ice Blast, repeatedly nuking them with Purifying Flames can prevent them from benefiting from the heal for the duration of the debuff, especially if the allied Ancient Apparition has an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/><br/>Beware that Purifying Flames is still registered as player damage, even when targeted on an ally, and can trigger on-damage effects. This means that it can remove layers of Refraction, Living Armor and Gravekeeper's Cloak if not shielded by Fate's Edict first, and can cancel Clarity, Healing Salve and Urn of Shadows even if Fate's Edict was cast first; it can even put an allied Blink Dagger on cooldown at an inopportune moment if not shielded by Fate's Edict first. Be careful about when you use Purifying Flames to heal allies, as using it even in situations with no present threats can be a detriment to your team.<br/><br/>Purifying Flames is a strong lane control spell as it can be used to secure last hits and denies as the spell has a relatively low mana cost and it does not have a projectile.<br/>A neat trick about Purifying Flames is that it can act as a pseudo Sacrifice from level 2 and above. Simply cast it on your range creep and start denying it before it heals past the 50% threshold.<br/><br/><h4>False Promise</h4>False Promise temporarily delays all damage and healing done to an ally, while constantly applying a strong dispel on them, dealing its damage and double the heal at the end of the duration.<br/><br/>The delayed damage at the end of the spell can be lethal, meaning that the target for False Promise is not guaranteed to live. However, all healing done during the spell is doubled, which means that enough healing items and abilities can allow Oracle to save an ally from the brink of death and restore them to full health at the end of the spell.<br/><br/>Constant use of Purifying Flames during False Promise, along with any other healing spells and items, are key to allowing a teammate to survive at the end of the spell, as the doubled healing portion will allow the target to recover far more health than the damage they take from the nuke portion. Depending on the situation, casting Fate's Edict first may or may not be a good idea, as the disarm can prevent the target from attacking during the spell despite the strong dispel.<br/><br/>Because the heal is doubled at the end of the spell, False Promise greatly benefits from healing sources that are not Oracle himself. Abilities like Chemical Rage, Inner Vitality, Death Pulse and so on can go a long way towards ensuring the survival of the target at the end of the spell.<br/><br/>Beware that it is still possible for a False Promise target to be disabled during the spell, as area disables like Chronosphere, Black Hole, Static Storm and Smoke Screen do not place a dispellable debuff on the affected units. As well, spells like Doom and Demonic Purge place debuffs that cannot be dispelled. Take the enemy's spell composition into account when using False Promise, as casting it on the wrong target or at the wrong time can still waste the spell.<br/><br/>The damage vs healing calculation does not take into account whether the damage is non-lethal or lethal. While the damage from Purifying Flames is normally non-lethal, it nevertheless still contributes fully to the damage calculations.<br/>Example 1: Unit A is on 100 HP. Oracle casts False Promise on Unit A. Unit B deals 700 damage to Unit A. Oracle casts Purifying Flames twice to Unit A, dealing 600 damage but healing 1000 during the remaining of the False Promise duration. Total damage = 1300. Total healing = 1000. Therefore, once False Promise ends, Unit B lands the killing blow of 100 damage onto Unit A.<br/><br/>Example 2: Unit A is on 700 hp. Oracle casts False Promise on Unit A. Unit B deals 600 damage to Unit A. Near the end of the False Promise duration, Oracle casts Purifying Flames on Unit A, dealing 300 damage and only healing for 100. Total damage = 900. Healing = 50. Therefore, once False Promise ends, Unit B deals 600 damage to Unit A, and Oracle deals 99 (non-lethal) damage to Unit A, leaving Unit A at 1 hp.<br/><br/>Casting Purifying Flames with less than 5 seconds of False Promise remaining is thus not a good idea.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tangos and Healing Salve allow Oracle to sustain his HP in-lane, preventing him from being harassed away by enemy attacks.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength give Oracle more HP, making him much less squishy. It can be used to build a Bracer.<br/><br/>Iron Branch is cheap and gives Oracle extra attributes. It can be used to build Magic Wand, or Mekansm.<br/><br/>Animal Courier should be purchased by the hard support at the start of a match.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick allows Oracle to instantly replenish his HP and mana, useful in a tight situation or in the middle of a teamfight. Surviving just long enough to cast one or two more of his high-impact spells to change the tide of an engagement.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed helps boost Oracle's respectable base movement speed. In the early game, it allows him to quickly get within range to cast Fortune's End on an enemy during a gank.<br/><br/>Bracer improves Oracle's all-around attributes, particularly strength for more HP.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand gives Oracle extra attributes, crucial to have on a hard support with no farm priority. The extra charge storage can give Oracle enough mana to cast his ultimate, or another round of his basic spells.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots greatly improves Oracle's survivability and mobility. The movement speed allows him to more easily position himself for his spells, while the armor helps him to survive in the face of enemy attacks. The passive HP regen allows him to keep his HP at full, reducing the need to return to base.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a powerful support item, allowing Oracle to replenish the health of his teammates. In particular, it can be used in tandem with False Promise to heal an ally for 500 HP rather than 250.<br/><br/>Observer Wards are important support items that provide crucial vision for Oracle's team. Knowing where the enemy is allows him to be present at fights to change the fate of allies and enemies alike.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is crucial to have at all times on powerful impact supports like Oracle. His ability to defy fate with his spells makes him a powerful ally to have in any fight.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Blink Dagger gives Oracle greatly improved mobility and positioning. Getting within range to cast his spells allows Oracle to change the tide of engagements, and it can also help to increase his mobility around the map, reaching hot-spots more easily and allowing him to escape ganks as needed, especially as False Promise can be used to prevent it from going on cooldown due to player damage.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel allows Oracle to move around the map at will, appearing to save allies from enemy ganks or showing up to add his nukes and disables to a fight. The increased movement speed greatly improves his mobility, allowing him to more easily get in position to cast spells.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a powerful item to build on any intelligence support hero. It improves Oracle's attributes, and greatly increases the size of his mana pool and gives him powerful mana regen. The active allows him to instantly hard-disable an enemy from long range, drastically improving his impact in teamfights.<br/><br/>Dagon greatly improves Oracle's burst damage potential, on top of Fortune's End and Purifying Flames. Used in combination with his spells, Oracle can potentially blow up squishy enemy supports almost instantly.<br/><br/>Flying Courier is crucial to purchase as early as possible, in order to facilitate ferrying important items to Oracle's team.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves greatly improves Oracle's support potential, allowing him to replenish both HP and mana for his allies. Just as importantly, using the active allows Oracle to remove debuffs from himself, chief among them silences that may be preventing him from casting spells.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards should be regularly purchased along with Observer Wards, in order to de-ward enemy vision where possible.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is cheap and gives Oracle a way to sustain his casting. The HP and mana regen allow him to remain in the field without having to return to base as often, while the burst mana regen allows Oracle to quickly get the mana he needs to cast his low-cost low-cooldown spells. As well, it can be used for free healing by combining Fate's Edict and Purifying Flames, the sum of which costs less mana than the amount given by Soul Ring's active.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a useful support item that gives Oracle some better benefits than a Bracer. It provides the same amount of strength while also giving some mana regen. The charges can be used as yet another source of healing or damage alongside Purifying Flames.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a useful utility support item that gives Oracle many benefits. It increases Oracle's armor, giving him more survivability, and some mana regen for sustaining his mana pool. While Oracle does not specialize in dealing physical damage, the active can be cast on allies to give them more survivability, particularly during False Promise to increase the odds of surviving. Upgrading to a Solar Crest further increases the benefits it provides.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots is more expensive than Tranquil Boots, but greatly improves Oracle's team contribution. Increasing the size of his mana pool allows Oracle to get more out of his spells, and the active can replenish mana for himself and his allies.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a powerful utility item that synergizes with Oracle's ability to protect teammates. Cast on an ally, it can help with initiation for casting short-ranged disables in lieu of a Blink Dagger. As well, it can be cast in place of Fate's Edict to give an ally invisibility as well as increased magic resistance when fleeing. While not as strong as Fate's Edict at mitigating damage from Purifying Flames, it does not disarm the target, allowing them to act if needed.<br/><br/>Force Staff is an easy-to-build item that gives Oracle many good benefits and synergizes with his abilities. The increased intelligence gives him more mana, while the HP regen keeps his health topped up. The active allows Oracle to quickly re-position himself for casting his spells, and in a pinch can be used as an escape ability. It can be cast during False Promise to help a fleeing ally clear the area faster and put them in a safer place from where Oracle can quickly heal them back up.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is a useful utility item that increases Oracle's teamfight contribution. Increasing his intelligence and strength gives Oracle more survivability and allows him to more easily utilize his spells, and the summons can add damage output during a teamfight. Upgrading to level 3 allows Oracle to provide True Sight as needed.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity greatly improves Oracle's casting ability while giving him a powerful active. The increased intelligence and mana regen fuel Oracle's spell casting, ensuring that he can use his spell combos more easily, and the bonus movement speed grant him more mobility for positioning himself for casting his spells. The active can be cast on himself to purge debuffs (such as silences) while providing temporary invulnerability, or can be targeted on an enemy as a hard-disable that purges buffs, doubling up on his ability to do so with Fortune's End.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a strong teamfight item that helps Oracle to further protect his teammates. The magic resistance and HP regen help to make Oracle more survivable, while the aura gives his team improved resistance to magic nukes, including from Purifying Flames. Using the active in a teamfight will allow him to shield allies from enemy magic nukes, without having to resort to Fate's Edict.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb is an expensive but powerful utility item that allows Oracle to take False Promise to its limit. The item gives Oracle more armor, increasing his survivability, and HP and mana regen for self-sustain. Echo Shell, when cast on a False Promise target, can dissuade enemies from targeting them with burst damage nukes, increasing the target's survivability.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence gives Oracle an assortment of useful bonuses and a strong active. The increased intelligence and mana regen help fuel Oracle's casting, while the damage and attack speed bonus allow him to be a threat with his auto-attacks. The active can be used to prevent enemy spell casters from using their abilities, or can be combined with Fate's Edict to completely prevent an enemy from attacking or casting spells.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard greatly improves Oracle's survivability and gives him more casting power. The intelligence greatly increases the size of his mana pool, while the armor helps him to resist physical damage. The Freezing Aura can reduce enemy attack speed, allowing Oracle to reduce the effectiveness of enemy auto-attacks, particularly against a False Promise target, while Arctic Blast can be used to add more nuke damage and slow enemies from fleeing or pursuing.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Outworld Devourer is a carry and a disabler. He is one of the few damage dealers who can also reset fights, break chain stuns, and save teammates thanks to his Astral Imprisonment. He is also one of the few heroes who can reliably deal pure damage thanks to Arcane Orb, which can also steal intelligence from heroes and does extra damage against summons and illusions. Nearby allies benefit from Essence Aura as they have a chance to regain a percentage of their max mana each spell cast. Finally, Sanity's Eclipse not only deals damage in a large radius based on Outworld Devourer's current intelligence, but also remove 40% of their maximum mana.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals massive amounts of pure damage.<br/><br/>Capable of snowballing out of control.<br/><br/>Punishes mana dependent and low intelligence heroes.<br/><br/>High starting move speed.<br/><br/>Chain stun breaker<br/><br/>Excellent gank setup<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Damage is nullified by spell immunity or when silenced.<br/><br/>Ineffective vs high intelligence heroes.<br/><br/>Bad at destroying buildings.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Stealing intelligence from enemy heroes for 80 seconds (140 with the talent) can make a big difference between enemy heroes and give you a high advantage.<br/><br/>At level 7 (which is where Essence Aura can be maxed out) with Power Treads to intelligence, 2x Null Talisman, Force Staff (or Staff of Wizardry because it have same intelligence) and 8-10 intelligence steal from enemy hero or Point Booster (to Aghanim's Scepter for great crowd control) its nearly impossible to lose your mana.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arcane Orb</h4>Arcane Orb is incredibly costly as an auto skill, and as such, you should only invest into it when you have the mana capacity to sustain it.<br/><br/>This is your main damaging ability later on in the game. As an intelligence carry, you directly benefit from items which increase your intelligence due to the increase in your right-click damage, mana pool and resultant Arcane Orb damage.<br/><br/>Arcane Orb deals pure damage, making it a great skill to harass enemies with very high armor.<br/><br/>Due to Outworld Devourer's skill set, Arcane Orb would be your main consumption, and recovery, of mana.<br/>Casting Arcane Orb on neutral or enemy creeps is a good way to recover lost mana, provided that you have learnt Essence Aura, as the pseudo-random distribution mechanic will eventually guarantee a proc by Essence Aura.<br/><br/><h4>Astral Imprisonment</h4>The first point should generally be invested in Astral Imprisonment, as Arcane Orb is too costly early game and your mana pool is too low for it to be an effective use of mana consumption for pure damage.<br/><br/>Astral Imprisonment's supportive utility allows for creative application of the spell in.<br/>It can be used to save yourself or allied heroes from spells with long delays, such as X Marks the Spot and Ghostship if timed correctly.<br/><br/>In addition, you can save allied heroes from potentially lethal abilities such as Reaper's Scythe and Winter's Curse.<br/><br/>Similarly, it can also be used to dodge projectiles. It is important to time it so that the projectiles connect while imprisoned, since the spell does not disjoint projectiles.<br/><br/>Astral Imprisonment can be used on them to negate some of the damage from damage over time abilities, such as Poison Nova and Doom, which can potentially end up saving the ally. Against long lasting debuffs, it can be cast twice before the debuff expire.<br/><br/><br/>When misused and poorly timed, the application of Astral Imprisonment heavily backfire.<br/>Just like how it can save allies from spells and damage, it can also do the same for your opponents, so communication with the team is important to prevent wasting of spells.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible for you to cause a teammate's demise by casting Astral Imprisonment on them at the wrong time (such as when they have just begun to channel an escape ability).<br/><br/><br/>Casting Astral Imprisonment removes your opponent from the battlefield for 4 seconds. This buys you or your allies enough time to use Blink Dagger or a Town Portal Scroll to escape to safety.<br/><br/>Astral Imprisonment is applied to all enemy heroes when they are hit by an Aghanim's Scepter's Sanity's Eclipse. As mentioned above, timing is key, as placing enemies in a state of Astral Imprisonment can heavily disrupt the flow of battle.<br/><h4>Essence Aura</h4>Essence Aura is a great support aura for Heroes with low cooldown and low cost abilities that are used to harass their opponents (such as Bristleback's Quill Spray, Skywrath Mage's Arcane Bolt and Dazzle's Shadow Wave).<br/>Essence Aura can be considered as the first skill to learn depending on your hero line-up, as early-game spell harassment can greatly deter your opponents and mess up their ability to last hit effectively.<br/><br/>Essence Aura carried by illusions are fully active and will trigger the mana recovery aspect of the skill, allowing the illusions of Outworld Devourer to be of even greater support for the team by providing multiple areas of coverage.<br/><br/><br/>Early points in Essence Aura can be useful if you find yourself in need of mana, as it provides a respectable amount of 125 mana at level one, which is half of what an energy booster provides.<br/><br/>As Essense Aura uses a pseudo-random distribution mechanic, Outworld Devourer needs 1000/1200/1400/1600 mana in order to not run dry of his mana pool.<br/>Casting Arcane Orb on neutral or enemy creeps is a good way to recover lost mana as the pseudo-random distribution mechanic will eventually guarantee a proc by Essence Aura.<br/><br/><br/>Essence Aura does not proc on item abilities. Be wary of your mana consumption when using items such as Refresher Orb.<br/><h4>Sanity's Eclipse</h4>This ability is best used as a finisher; after acquiring enough stolen intelligence in a teamfight or gank, Sanity's Eclipse can be used to snuff out any remaining enemy heroes, especially escaping invisible heroes like Riki, Clinkz and Bounty Hunter<br/><br/>Keep in mind that heroes which gain intelligence at extremely high rates such as Silencer, Invoker and Pugna will often take minimal if not zero damage from this ability. As such, it's best to refrain from using this ability against these heroes unless you're significantly ahead in intelligence and certain it can finish them off.<br/><br/>Astral Imprisonment is applied to all enemy heroes when they are hit by an Aghanim's Scepter's Sanity Eclipse. As mentioned above, timing is key, as placing enemies in a state of Astral Imprisonment can heavily disrupt the flow of battle.<br/>An Aghanim's Scepter's Sanity Eclipse can be used as a means to temporary remove all the enemy heroes from the field, giving your team time to regroup and follow up with other spells, or to retreat to safety.<br/><br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Null Talisman provides cheap compact stats for a mid-laner with low base damage.<br/><br/>Faerie Fire gives a little bit of extra damage, and can be consumed to turn the tide in a close fight.<br/><br/>Tango (Shared) from supports allows the mid-laner to maximize their early game stats.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed will make Harbinger even faster, which is important in middle lane.<br/><br/>Bottle and/or Magic Wand provide OD with more regen, making him less reliant on shrines.<br/><br/>A second Null Talisman is a common item for intelligence heroes during the laning phase, as they can be built into Veil of Discord.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Power Treads gives more attack speed and intelligence to cast more Arcane Orbs.<br/><br/>Force Staff provides both initiation and escape mechanism, which he lacks.<br/><br/>Hurricane Pike is the natural upgrade from Force Staff, giving more cheap stats, improving OD's low attack range, and providing a sizable attack speed bonus when used on an enemy target.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Veil of Discord provides some much-needed regen and armor, and is a cheap way to amplify the damage of his ultimate and Astral Imprisonment.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger increases his mobility even more, allowing OD to blink to safety after a self-cast Astral Imprisonment.<br/><br/>Black King Bar protects against most disables and nukes, buying Harbinger the time to stack intelligence and use his ultimate more effectively.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard will give him more armor for survivability, as well as more intelligence. The slow also helps him either chase, or escape.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides him with both additional intelligence and a silencing disable, giving him more time to deal damage with his Arcane Orb.<br/><br/>Octarine Core gives the most mana in a single item, as well as immense survivability for Outworld Devourer by lifestealing from his Arcane Orb and his other spells. It also allows Sanity Eclipse to be used more frequently.<br/><br/>Moon Shard gives a high attack speed boost, allowing to deal more damage in battles and steal intelligence faster.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos will provide him with additional health and intelligence, as well as the ability to root against a single target.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence gives him even more intelligence and attack speed, and also gives him a Silence ability that also amplifies his damage for the time period. Also builds later into Bloodthorn.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is one of the strongest late-game items on OD, as it allows Sanity's Eclipse, as well as items like BKB and Hex to be cast twice, which can be devastating in teamfights.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter provides all round stat, health and mana boost, as well as causing Sanity's Eclipse to apply Astral Imprisonment to all enemy heroes under the effects of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Puck is an extremely elusive hero who misleads and disrupts enemies with a combination of disabling items and abilities. Though vulnerable, Puck is able to initiate on enemy teams, silencing and locking down opponents before teleporting away in a glowing orb. Puck's arsenal of tricks and items require sharp situational awareness during teamfights, and can be overwhelming to newer players. Nonetheless, a well-played Puck can escape nearly any situation, and return to repeatedly disable opponents for his teammates.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very hard to pin down.<br/><br/>Fairly mobile.<br/><br/>Good lane ganker.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable to disables.<br/><br/>Slow turn rate.<br/><br/>Requires multitasking.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Puck is almost always played in mid, but can also play a solo lane against multiple opponents due to his slippery nature.<br/><br/>As a mid hero, Puck has easy access to Runes with Illusory Orb, and can gank the side lanes effectively with Dream Coil.<br/><br/>With a Blink Dagger, Puck becomes a capable albeit fragile initiator.<br/><br/>Puck deals significant magical nuke damage in the early game with Illusory Orb and Waning Rift.<br/><br/>Puck's abilities, as well as his tendency to buy items with active abilities, makes him a busy multitasker in teamfights. Knowing when to use which ability/item is key to playing him well.<br/><br/>A good initiation combo is as follows: Blink Dagger, then Waning Rift, then Dream Coil, then Illusory Orb through as many enemies as possible but in a safe direction, Phase Shift to remain safe, then Ethereal Jaunt to teleport to the Orb. The silence from Waning Rift is long enough to execute this combination.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Illusory Orb</h4>Use Illusory Orb in lane to harass opponents, or get a few extra last hits.<br/><br/>After using Illusory Orb, move in the opposite direction to present enemies with a dilemma. This forces opponents to choose one direction, while Puck escapes by choosing whether or not to Ethereal Jaunt.<br/><br/>If Puck uses Illusory Orb just before dying, he can buy back instantly and return to the fight with Ethereal Jaunt.<br/><br/>Illusory Orb moves faster than Puck, and can be used when Puck needs to get somewhere quickly.<br/><br/>Illusory Orb can function as Puck's iniation tool before he has a Blink Dagger.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Waning Rift</h4>When initiating, use Waning Rift immediately after jumping in with Blink Dagger so enemies cannot disable Puck before he uses Dream Coil.<br/><br/>If Phase Shift is on cooldown, use Waning Rift to silence enemies, giving Puck's escape mechanisms more time to come off cooldown without being disabled.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Phase Shift</h4>During the early game, use Phase Shift to avoid tower attacks and harassment, including autoattacks.<br/><br/>Using Phase Shift removes creep aggro. This allows Puck to freely harass with auto-attacks, then use Phase Shift to avoid taking damage from creeps.<br/><br/>Use Phase Shift right after Illusory Orb to remain safe until the orb has travelled far enough to teleport to.<br/><br/>Level 4 Phase Shift's duration is long enough to wait out Blink Dagger's 3 second cooldown, allowing Puck to escape from many dangerous situations.<br/>Keep in mind that Puck must still turn in the direction he is blinking towards. Puck's turn rate is among the lowest of all heroes.<br/><br/><br/>With fast enough reaction time, Phase Shift can be used to dodge an incoming iniation, allowing Puck to counter-initiate with Waning Rift and Dream Coil.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h4>Dream Coil</h4>Use Dream Coil to interrupt teleporting enemies.<br/><br/>Dream Coil will catch enemies who are not in vision.<br/><br/>Try to catch enemies at the edge of Dream Coil's cast radius, and this makes it more likely that they will break the bonds and be stunned.<br/><br/>Dream Coil's relatively low cooldown means it can be used on high value single targets, such as an enemy hard carry.<br/><br/>More tips needed.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items</b><br/>Healing Salve helps keep Puck in lane.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Puck to use Illusory Orb more often in lane.<br/><br/>Null Talisman and its components gives Puck a decent stats boost.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game</b><br/>Magic Stick can help Puck sustain mana and health to keep active in the mid lane.<br/><br/>Bottle is optimal for Puck because of his mid presence, and is needed to replenish mana for his early game nukes.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is always useful for rotating lanes and helping out allies.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items</b><br/>Blink Dagger provides great synergy with Puck's other abilities and further augments Puck's evasive nature.<br/><br/>Power Treads help Puck in the early-mid game, as they supplement both Puck's small health pool, as well as Puck's mana pool.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots is a viable alternative, and helps Puck use his magical nukes more often in the early game.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items</b><br/>Veil of Discord is a good item to greatly increase your team's DPS in the early/mid game, which is what Puck should probably strive for. The build-up with 2 Null Talismans is perfect.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a useful pickup if your team needs another disable really soon. It also keeps Puck safe for a few extra seconds until his other escape abilities come off cooldown.<br/>If you use it on yourself right after launching your Illusory Orb, the banish from the Eul's should last just the right amount so you get a near max-distance Ethereal Jaunt.<br/><br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is really good on Puck against Black King Bar carriers. It Increases coil duration, coil-break damage and coil-break stun duration. Makes Coil-break stun pierce spell immunity.<br/><br/>Dagon is a good extension from your core if the enemy team doesn't have the resources to focus you down, as it greatly increases your magic damage.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard will increase your mana pool and your resistance to physical damage, which makes it an ideal item against right-click heroes. It will also provide you with a fairly powerful AoE nuke and slow.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is very useful if you are more of an initiator than a damage dealer, and it will also provide you with helpful attribute bonuses.<br/><br/>Hand of Midas can be a great pick up to help you keep up with farm and scale better. The reasoning behind it is that, once you've farmed a Blink Dagger, you have all the items you need to be effective in team fights. However, as Puck is usually played mid, he can lack the DPS of other mid heroes in the late game, as he does not have the mobility tools to farm as quickly as Storm Spirit or Ember Spirit for example. Hand of Midas will help you keep up and snowball further into the late game, or at least stay relevant.<br/><br/>Force Staff gives Puck extra mobility. Can also be used to break Dream Coil to trigger a stun.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides a large amount of mana and mana regen (which are useful as Puck's abilities have a large mana cost), as well as having a very effective disable.<br/><br/>Bloodstone will eliminate any need for extra mana regen, while also giving you a large amount of HP. However, it should be only picked up if you are snowballing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Pugna is a utility caster whose spells give him strong nuking power and offer utility in various situations. He offers strong teamfight contribution and can push and counter-push very effectively with his nukes.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High mobility<br/><br/>Devastating nukes<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health pool<br/><br/>Low armor<br/><br/>Sloppy attack animation and attack speed.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Possessing the second-highest base movement speed in the game (tied with Luna) and a shorter-than-average cast animation, Pugna can be a very mobile hero who can get his spells off more easily than most other casters. However, his pitiful strength means that being caught by the enemy often means that he can be easily killed.<br/><br/>Because of a combination of his squishiness and reliance on spell-casting, Pugna benefits most from building items that boost the size of his HP pool and provide him with mana regeneration. Because he has the highest intelligence growth in the game, Pugna's mana pool can support his spell casting relatively easily, so obtaining percentage-based mana regen can keep him from needing to return to base as often.<br/><br/>Beware that despite his awesome nuking potential, Pugna does not have any hard disables, and thus enemies can easily escape him either by running away or channeling a Town Portal Scroll. In order to reliably nuke down and kill enemy heroes, Pugna must rely on allied disables, or purchase disable items himself.<br/><br/>In general, Pugna requires farm and levels in order to be effective, however, he can also contribute to teamfights with levels alone.<br/><br/>Pugna can be played as a solo mid-laner in order to bring out his potential. Regular use of Nether Blast allows Pugna to easily nuke down creep waves, as well as harass the enemy mid, and can also be used to quickly destroy the enemy tower if needed, giving Pugna's team an early advantage in gold and map control. Afterward, Pugna can transition into using Nether Blast to farm and push, and purchasing items to increase his effectiveness in teamfights.<br/><br/>When not given farm priority, Pugna can be played as a side-lane support, using Nether Blast to harass and Decrepify as a setup disable, as well as using Nether Blast to push down towers early in a match. By stacking and pulling camps, Pugna can earn himself experience and gold to buy more support items for his team as needed, and level up his abilities to increase his teamfight contribution.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Nether Blast</h4>Nether Blast is a ground-targeted area nuke that, after a delay, deals magic damage within its radius.<br/><br/>Due to its extremely low cooldown and the damage scaling, Nether Blast is a good ability to max out first as Pugna. It greatly increases Pugna's nuking potential, and can be used for pushing and farming.<br/><br/>The long delay on Nether Blast makes it a hard spell to land on enemies who are watching Pugna's animations in an attempt to dodge the explosion. Try to fake them out with animation canceling if needed, as dispositioning the enemy can give Pugna more space for last-hitting or harass them out of range of last-hitting creeps.<br/><br/>Remember that Nether Blast can damage buildings as well, which can allow Pugna to quickly destroy enemy towers if given the chance. Cast at the right time, it also greatly improves the chances of getting the last-hit on the tower if enemies are attempting to deny it or allied creeps are currently attacking it.<br/><br/>Nether Blast has an extremely short cast range, but a wide radius, allowing Pugna to nuke targets up to 800 range away. Be very careful about using the spell to harass, as its short cast range may put Pugna in danger. Try to use the radius to your advantage and catch enemies as close to the far edge as possible, in order to keep as great a distance between them and Pugna.<br/><br/>The key to efficient use of Nether Blast is to try to catch as many targets within its radius as possible. Try using it to last-hit creeps while at the same time nuking your lane opponent, or catching an enemy creep wave and tower at the same time during a push.<br/><h4>Decrepify</h4>Decrepify inflicts its target, enemy or ally, with ethereal, slowing them while also reducing their magic resistance.<br/><br/>Because all of Pugna's damage output is magical, Decrepify is a good ability to max out early on, as the magic resistance reduction can greatly improve his damage output. Leveling up the ability increases its disable and debuff potential, while reducing its turnaround time due to the greatly reduced cooldown.<br/><br/>Casting Decrepify on enemies can act as a disable and debuff.<br/><br/>Inflicting ethereal on an enemy will disarm them while slowing and reducing their magic resistance. This can be useful for stopping right-click carries in their tracks, and open them up to be hit with Nether Blast as well as other magic nukes.<br/><br/>Be careful about when you cast Decrepify on enemies, as ethereal will also prevent allies from damaging them with physical attacks. Using the spell at the wrong time can inadvertently save the enemy, so judge the situation accordingly before committing the spell.<br/><br/>As an allied-targeted spell, Decrepify can be used as a powerful defensive ability.<br/><br/>Casting Decrepify on allies will slow them and reduce their magic resistance, but it will also render them immune to physical damage, which can save them from being killed by auto-attacks or physical damage spells.<br/><br/>As with casting Decrepify on enemies, be sure to analyze the situation before committing Decrepify on allies. The magic resistance reduction can also be taken advantage of by the enemy, who can finish off your teammate with a high-powered nuke.<br/><br/>Decrepify can be used as a powerful laning spell due to its extremely long cast range. Casting it on an enemy will prevent them from attacking, allowing Pugna to last-hit and deny low-health creeps without enemy interference. As well, using it as an initiating slow can allow allies to quickly move into position to land initiating nukes and disables with greater potency.<br/><br/>When using Decrepify in combination with Nether Blast, try to take advantage of Decrepify's long cast range in order to cover for Nether Blast's delay. Target Nether Blast on an enemy, and then quickly cast Decrepify on them immediately afterward; the target will be slowed and unable to retreat outside of the range of Nether Blast, taking additional damage from the reduced magic resistance.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Decrepify can be used as physical damage immunity while channeling spells or items. In particular, casting Decrepify prior to channeling a Town Portal Scroll can prevent enemies from finishing off a target (or Pugna himself) unless they have an interrupting disable.<br/><br/>Decrepify can save allied heroes from early game rune clashes, where most of the damage output of all heroes is physical attacks.<br/><h4>Nether Ward</h4>Nether Ward places a ward that degenerates enemy mana within a wide radius, and counters enemy spell usage if they expend mana within its range.<br/><br/>Because Nether Ward is dependent on enemies expending mana, it is only useful in teamfights and as a counter-spell nuke during ganks. As teamfights do not happen until later in a match and ganks are situational, Nether Ward is a situational pickup in the early game and should be maxed out last.<br/><br/>Nether Ward is a powerful teamfight and counter-gank ability that can greatly debilitate the enemy team if placed properly ahead of an engagement. Enemies attempting to cast spells and use items will deal tremendous damage to themselves based on the mana cost, and potentially kill themselves if the mana cost of their abilities is high enough.<br/><br/>As Nether Ward fires its mana flares as magical damage, reducing the enemy's magic resistance through Decrepify can cause them to take increased damage from the flares.<br/><br/>If time permits, placing Nether Ward during a gank can allow Pugna to deal nuke damage to punish enemies that attempt to land counter-disables or escape spells. Combined with Pugna's other nukes, this can often be enough to finish an enemy off before they can successfully escape.<br/><br/>Because Nether Ward fires its flares before the enemy spell takes effect, it is possible to cancel the spell from happening if they die from the flare damage, making it a strong ability against spells like Laguna Blade, Freezing Field, Finger of Death and Mystic Flare.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Nether Ward has an extremely short cast range, so Pugna must move himself to the location where he wishes to place it. Try taking advantage of the ward's wide influence radius and place it behind your team or inside of a treeline where it will be hard to get to.<br/><br/>Beware that even if the Nether Ward itself is hidden, the mana flares are visible to the enemy team, meaning that they can triangulate its position based on where the flares are coming from. Placing the ward behind Pugna's team can prevent them from easily destroying it even if they determine its location.<br/><br/>The Nether Ward itself is a valid target for Decrepify, allowing Pugna to temporarily shield it from damage. This can be useful for extending its survivability for a few more seconds, and can allow Pugna to use the ward itself as bait to draw in enemies.<br/><h4>Life Drain</h4>Life Drain is a channeled spell that causes Pugna to drain HP from a target enemy, replenishing his HP or mana. It can also be cast on allies to heal them using Pugna's HP pool.<br/><br/>Life Drain can be a powerful nuking and survivability spell if Pugna can prevent the enemy from disabling him during the channeling. By healing himself while simultaneously damaging a target enemy, Pugna can quickly negate any damage that the enemy deals to him while also dealing heavy damage to an enemy and potentially scoring a kill.<br/><br/>In general, try to get as close as possible to an enemy before casting Life Drain on them; unless they have a disable or silence, their only option for breaking the link is to run away.<br/><br/>As with Pugna's other abilities, Life Drain is magical damage that can be augmented by reducing the enemy's magic resistance. Casting Decrepify on an enemy prior to Life Drain will greatly increase the amount of damage dealt (and in turn the amount healed).<br/><br/>Life Drain can pierce spell immunity; however, the damage/heal is also directly dependent on the amount of damage dealt, so targeting a spell immune enemy will not deal any damage nor will it heal Pugna.<br/><br/>Be careful about when and where you cast Life Drain. As the link breaks upon loss of vision on the target, enemies can escape by utilizing the Fog of War, either by juking around trees or simply walking far enough away at nighttime, and can use invisibility spells or items as well.<br/><br/>With its low cooldown, Life Drain can be used tactically provided that Pugna has the mana to back it up. As Life Drain is not restricted to be cast on heroes only, Pugna can use the spell to replenish his HP by draining enemy or neutral creeps.<br/><br/>If Pugna's HP is full, Life Drain will instead refill his mana when targeted on enemy heroes. However, mind that this cannot be used on enemy and neutral creeps, which can only restore Pugna's health.<br/><br/>Life Drain destroys enemy illusions upon the first damage tick. When combined with Aghanim's Scepter, this allows Pugna to instantly remove enemy illusions from play, which can be useful in cases such as Haunt and Replicate/ Hybrid.<br/><br/>When targeted on an ally, Life Drain allows Pugna to use his HP to restore their health. This can be useful in situations where Pugna needs to save a teammate, such as an allied carry who is being focused down. As an additional bonus, its ability to pierce spell immunity allows Pugna to heal them through an active Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Functionally, An ally-targeted Life Drain acts as a reverse-cast ability with the target as the caster and Pugna as the target, though the channel is still focused on Pugna himself. This means that reducing Pugna's magic resistance (such as through a self-cast Decrepify) will increase the flow rate, while increasing Pugna's magic resistance will reduce the flow rate (or outright halt it in the case of 100% magic resistance through spell immunity or other abilities).<br/><br/>Be mindful that the damage dealt to Pugna is lethal, and can cause him to commit suicide. In certain situations, this can be useful both to heal an ally and deny Pugna in the face of enemy attacks.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Gauntlets of Strength and Circlet provide attributes to boost Pugna's early-game survivability. The increased strength gives him more HP to offset his squishiness.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Pugna to replenish his mana in-lane. This can be particularly useful for maintaining repeated casting of Nether Blast.<br/><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are crucial laning self-sustain items. Given Pugna's extremely low base HP, any source of HP regen goes a long way to keeping him alive.<br/><br/>In the case of playing as a support, purchasing Animal Courier and Observer and Sentry Wards should hold priority, as Pugna does not greatly rely on items to be effective in-lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick can be a very strong pickup on Pugna, as the burst HP regen can often be enough to keep him alive long enough to cast one or two more spells.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed can give Pugna a very strong mobility advantage over his lane opponents. Despite his already formidable base movement speed, becoming even more mobile can allow him to maneuver to offset his squishiness, and can be particularly useful when chasing down enemies to nuke them down.<br/><br/>Bracer, upgraded from already-purchased Gauntlets of Strength and Circlet, improves Pugna's strength to give him enough HP to be more survivable.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand gives Pugna additional attributes and increased charge storage. Both are extremely useful on a very low-HP hero whose low-cost spells can greatly affect the outcome of a teamfight.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots increases the size of Pugna's mana pool while allowing him to replenish it. Given Pugna's heavy reliance on casting, securing an early source of mana regen is crucial.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter greatly improves Pugna's survivability and nuking power. It provides stats across the board, giving Pugna more HP and mana, both of which he severely needs. The upgraded Life Drain allows Pugna to sustain his own HP in fights while simultaneously using it as a damage-over-time nuke on the enemy, and the removed cooldown allows him to immediately cast it again after being interrupted.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should be carried at all times on all heroes. While Pugna is not the strongest ganker, his spells make him a very strong asset to have in any teamfight, particularly due to the potency of a pre-placed Nether Ward.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Mekansm is a strong teamfight utility item to pick up on Pugna. It gives him increased attributes and armor, increasing his survivability and giving him an active to heal himself and his team; it can be combined with an allied-cast Life Drain, healing Pugna to recoup lost health while further boosting the amount of HP recovered to an ally. Pugna's tremendous intelligence growth ensures that he can easily afford the mana cost.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos gives Pugna additional disable and many strong bonuses for a cheap price. The increased HP greatly improves Pugna's survivability, while the bonus intelligence augments his mana pool and base damage. The active can be combined with Decrepify to slow a foe down to minimum movement speed, while the extremely long cast range allows Pugna to use it on enemies from complete safety.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives Pugna a hard disable and many powerful bonuses. It gives him stats across the board, vastly increased intelligence, and scaling mana regen to keep his mana pool topped up at all times. The Hex is an extremely powerful ability to have on hand in teamfights and ganks.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Pugna increased survivability and additional teamfight contribution. It greatly improves Pugna's armor, which combined with the Freezing Aura goes a long way towards decreasing his vulnerability to physical damage, and greatly improves the size of his mana pool as well. The active can be used as an additional damage nuke and slow, augmenting Pugna's existing ability to do both with his abilities.<br/><br/>Dagon greatly improves Pugna's nuking power, particularly when combined with Decrepify. It provides increased intelligence to boost the size of his mana pool as well.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is a strong survivability item to purchase on Pugna. The spell immunity prevents Pugna from being easily interrupted while channeling Life Drain, and when combined with a self-cast Decrepify can make him virtually invulnerable to all damage for a time.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a good early to mid game pick up that provides Pugna with a cheap increase to his attributes and movement speed.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is a good cheap support utility item to pick up as a support. It gives him additional strength for more HP, and some mana regen to sustain his casting. The active allows Pugna to heal teammates up on top of Life Drain, or recoup the HP cost of Life Drain when healing allies, and can also be cast on enemies as an additional damage nuke.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots is a cheaper substitute in place of Arcane Boots, but can be situationally useful on a support Pugna if an alternate source of mana replenishment can be obtained. It improves Pugna's armor, increasing his survivability, and greatly boosts his movement speed to make him more mobile. The passive HP regen keeps Pugna's HP topped up, and allows him to cast an allied Life Drain at will to keep allies' HP up.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a useful utility item that is useful on Pugna in any role. The increased magic resistance helps with survivability, while the active can be self-cast to shield Pugna during an enemy-targeted Life Drain. The invisibility can also be used to aid in initiation or escape, for Pugna or an ally.<br/><br/>Force Staff is very useful to purchase on Pugna in any situation. It gives Pugna extra mobility, as well as an escape ability that he otherwise lacks, and can be used to save allies on top of Decrepify. The increased intelligence boosts the size of his mana pool, while the HP regen keeps him topped up.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger greatly improves Pugna's mobility, allowing him to move more easily around the map or get within range to cast his spells much more easily. It also allows for much more creative placement of Nether Ward, as Pugna can utilize cliffs and ward spots should the opportunity present itself.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a cheap but useful nuke-boosting item to purchase on a support Pugna. It gives him stats across the board, a great amount of intelligence, and provides armor and HP regen, increasing his survivability somewhat. The active greatly boosts the effectiveness of all of Pugna's spells, particularly as it can be stacked on top of Decrepify to further reduce enemies' magic resistance.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is a very strong utility item that can boost Pugna's all-around effectiveness, and can be easily completed through disassembling Arcane Boots. The increased mana pool helps facilitate his spell casting, and the HP regen keeps his HP up and aids in casting an ally-targeted Life Drain. The increased cast range on all of Pugna's spells allow him to nuke his enemies from much safer distances, and also allows him to place Nether Ward at range (such as inside deep treelines or on elevated terrain). The spell damage amplification increases the potency of both Life Drain and Nether Blast, increasing Pugna's nuking power.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is an expensive investment but greatly boosts Pugna's ability to push and counter-push. The bonus movement speed makes Pugna even faster, allowing him to move more easily around the battlefield, and the teleport allows Pugna to move between lanes to either split-push the enemy and threaten their barracks or halt an enemy creep wave in its tracks before it reaches his base.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a useful utility item that gives Pugna increased casting and disabling capability. The scaling mana regeneration allows Pugna to take advantage of his plentiful intelligence growth, keeping his mana pool full so that he can remain out in the field for extended periods of time, and the improved movement speed makes him even more mobile. The active allows Pugna to either give himself temporary invulnerability while removing debuffs, or can be targeted on an enemy as a hard-disable, allowing him to easily land Nether Blast on an enemy.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is a powerful utility item that improves Pugna's teamfight contribution. The summoned warriors can be controlled while Pugna is channeling Life Drain, and can add additional damage output to a teamfight as needed. Upgraded to level 3, they can also provide True Sight, which can be useful for preventing enemies from casting invisibility abilities to break Life Drain.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence is somewhat unorthodox on Pugna, but can greatly augment his disabling and solo-killing power. Silencing an enemy can prevent them from easily casting counter-disables against Pugna, particularly while he is casting Life Drain, and Pugna's sheer nuking power can often be enough to finish off a target with the HP burn at the end of the silence duration. As well, the silence can be cast on top of Decrepify to prevent a single target from attacking or casting spells, rendering them helpless unless they have dispelling items. The item also greatly improves Pugna's intelligence and mana regen, further boosting his casting ability.<br/><br/>Bloodstone is a powerful tank item that greatly improves Pugna's HP and mana pool, vastly increasing his survivability in fights. Getting charges also allows Pugna to take utmost advantage of his short cooldown spells by greatly increasing his mana regen.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves, upgraded from a purchased Arcane Boots and Mekansm, gives Pugna increased survivability. Combining the benefits of both items, using the Mend allows Pugna to instantly purge debuffs from himself (such as silences), and the aura increases his team's survivability when their HP gets low through increased HP regen and armor.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is a situational utility item that gives Pugna tankiness and increases the staying power of his team. Greatly improving Pugna's HP makes him much less liable to die in teamfights, and thus able to contribute more in any given engagement. More importantly, it allows Pugna to use an allied Life Drain to greatly restore a teammate's HP and even replenish their mana, as he can quickly recoup the HP cost of the spell through the passive regen.<br/><br/>Octarine Core tremendously boosts Pugna's survivability and casting power, and can make him a force to be reckoned with when given farm priority. It greatly boosts Pugna's HP and mana, making him much tankier and allowing him to cast his spells profligately. The Spell Lifesteal and reduced cooldown vastly boost the potency of his nukes, allowing him to recover HP through short-cooldown Nether Blasts and recovering more HP than he takes from enemies during Life Drain. The cooldown reduction also allows him to have Nether Ward active at all times (assuming it isn't destroyed) and even have two active at once as the duration of the ward is 30 seconds and the cooldown is 26.25 after reduction.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Queen of Pain is a fearsome mid laner who has impressive mobility through Blink, along with several spells that deal significant damage. Despite her sizeable amounts of damage, she is very fragile and weak to disables, and must be played smartly in order to succeed.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Great blink<br/><br/>Can burst down foes quickly with her spells<br/><br/>Two good AoE spells in Scream of Pain and Sonic Wave<br/><br/>Her ultimate ignores Magic Resistance and Spell Immunity as it deals Pure damage<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low HP and Armor<br/><br/>Is suddenly very vulnerable if she blinks in and fails to kill a target with her combo<br/><br/>Sonic Wave can be dodged<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Queen of Pain is fairly straightforward to play as none of her damaging abilities require careful positioning or specific timings or combinations. Instead, like Anti-Mage, Queen of Pain starts to shine through proper Blink usage and good itemization, allowing her to farm with great efficiency and be a threat all over the map. Blink also allows her to jump in and out of fights for some potentially cheeky plays at low hp.<br/><br/>Her generic combo would be to blink in on a target and immediately use Scream of Pain as it has no cast time, slow him down with a Shadow Strike to help land your Sonic Wave. Follow with right clicks and an extra blink + scream to finish him off.... But you will usually have a couple of items you will need to add to the equation.<br/><br/>QoP is superb at chasing her prey, but is very delicate and is often in more danger from enemy towers than enemy heroes. Gearing for HP regeneration may be advisable, as in a critical situation you can Blink to an inaccessible place and wait to recuperate. Bottle will also help with this.<br/><br/>If being chased (a common situation for QoP), an often-useful tactic is to blink behind the enemies pursuing you. They will typically assume you blinked ahead and continue on in that direction, allowing for an escape.<br/>A more cautious strategy is to run in without using Blink, saving it for a potential escape. This may be necessary against high-damage enemy heroes, as QoP is very frail and in encounters should try to avoid being attacked at all.<br/><br/><br/>In a late-game encounter, QoP is best used by hiding until such time as the enemies' more powerful spells are on cooldown, allowing her to Blink in and inflict huge damage on multiple enemies owing to her AoE capabilities without putting her at risk of being killed by powerful spells.<br/><br/>Similarly to Lina, QoP has very high burst damage capabilities, but is delicate and not suited to long encounters because of her spells' high mana costs. This can be remedied with items such as Bloodstone and Linken's Sphere, as well as Aghanim's Scepter to reduce Sonic Wave's cooldown.<br/><br/>Be aware that Rupture will be calculated against the distance traversed should you Blink shorter than the max distance. You can avoid the damage by blinking max distance (1300 units) and moving immediately in that direction.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shadow Strike</h4>Shadow Strike has a very long duration, with the slow effect lasting for 15 seconds. Coupled with its incredible short cooldown, Queen of Pain is capable of keeping an enemy slowed indefinitely or slowing multiple heroes in quick succession.<br/>The slow effect diminishes with every passing second. Against Heroes with naturally high movement speed like Luna or Enchantress , you will need to constantly cast the spell to refresh the slow effect.<br/><br/><br/>The bulk of Shadow Strike's damage is dealt over time in intervals of 3 seconds. Heroes with high health regeneration and/or magic resistance can easily to shrug off the damage during its course.<br/>Enemy Heroes that are under the effects of Shadow Strike and are below 25% health are capable of being denied by their allies, and as such, it is not a reliable spell in securing a kill.<br/><br/><br/>Shadow Strike has a relatively short cast range, making it difficult to land the spell on opposing ranged Heroes without incurring damage herself. Consider the risk and mana consumption when engaging them.<br/>Against a melee opponent, it is a very powerful harassing skill. it may be worthwhile to maximise this skill if the opponent's lineup consist of entirely melee Heroes.<br/><br/><br/>Due to the long cast animation, as well as the slow traveling speed of the projectile, opponents with quick fingers can easily disjoint the spell.<br/><h4>Blink</h4>Blink is able to disjoint projectiles and spells.<br/><br/>Queen of Pain will always face in the direction that she is Blinking towards. Keen opponents will be able to use that knowledge to their advantage and predict where she may land.<br/><br/>Though Blink has a short cooldown of 6 seconds, a reckless cast can leave Queen of Pain in a dire situation.<br/><h4>Scream of Pain</h4>Despite the visual projectile, Scream of Pain cannot be disjointed.<br/>It will also affect invisible units and units in the Fog of War.<br/><br/><br/>Scream of Pain has a deceptively large radius of 475 units, making it viable as an initiating spell.<br/><h4>Sonic Wave</h4>Sonic Wave deals Pure damage and bypasses the spell immunity granted by Black King Bar.<br/>Since Sonic Wave deals Pure damage, the only ways of increasing its damage is though Intelligence items and Aether Lens.<br/><br/><br/>Sonic Wave is one of the few spells that can affect Animal Courier and Flying Courier.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Stating Items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tangoes for health regeneration while in lane and a Clarity which help allow Akasha to use her abilities more often to assert her lane dominance.<br/><br/>Purchasing a Mantle of Intelligence and a Circlet, which can later be turned into a Null Talisman, will increase her already high base damage for easier last hitting.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Getting a Bottle will provide her with reliable health and mana regeneration. Queen of Pain's Blink ability grants her almost incontestable rune control allowing her to easily replenish Bottle charges.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed give an increase in movement speed which can be very useful, especially when Blink is unavailable.<br/><br/>Magic Stick gives you much needed burst regen which can be used in emergency situations.<br/><br/>Null Talisman can be purchased to make last hitting even easier. This can be sold when not needed anymore or turned into a Dagon.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Magic Wand provides a nice increase to all attributes and burst regen.<br/><br/>Power Treads increase Akasha's attack speed and attributes allowing her to be more durable which allowing her to output sustainable damage.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter hugely reduces Sonic Wave's cooldown time, ensuring it is always available when it is needed. It also provides a useful increase in Sonic Wave's damage.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should always be carried to safely escape from or enter and contribute to fights.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Akasha has strong burst damage and initiation speed, but lacks a good disable and can be killed easily if she blinks in carelessly. Scythe of Vyse and Orchid Malevolence give her a strong disable to prevent the hero she blinks on from fighting back, as well as plenty of mana regeneration and a damage increase. Scythe of Vyse is better at shutting down right clickers while Orchid is good at stopping spellcasters and escape-oriented heroes.<br/><br/>To improve your damage, you can get items like Monkey King Bar, Desolator, and Mjollnir, which is an option if the enemy team has many heroes that can become magic immune or have high magic resistance.<br/><br/>For defensive options Eye of Skadi, Shiva's Guard, and Linken's Sphere are luxury pickups that make you harder to kill while also providing utility and mana. The slow effects pierce BKB and the added HP/Armor/Spell Shield, respectively, help you survive long enough to blink to safety.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord provides good stats at a fair price and the build-up is nice. Get one if your team can use the damage amp, but don't forget Sonic Wave will not benefit from it.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is not too bad either to buff up your damage, the 200 extra range on blink is always nice, though the range is already so good you probably don't need it for this particular reason. Unfortunately, it doesn't add the cast range to Scream of Pain.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is also good on QoP, it helps you bring towers down and it deals an unsuspected amount of damage if you can blink on top of an opponent and use it immediately. Especially deadly paired up with a Scythe of Vyse.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Rubick is a flexible spellcaster, best known for his ability to copy enemies last used spells to use against them. He is commonly picked as a counter to big teamfight spells such as Tidehunter's Ravage, Enigma's Black Hole and Earthshaker Echo Slam.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Instant cast time for stolen spells<br/><br/>High mana capacity.<br/><br/>Reliable Stun and Nuke that works very well in early-mid game.<br/><br/>High Magic Resistance.<br/><br/>Not item-dependent.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Low health pool<br/><br/>Lack of damage<br/><br/>Rubick's strength and effectiveness depends on Enemy's team picks.<br/><br/>One of the hardest heroes to play in this game.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Despite possessing attributes typical of the archetypal support caster, the possession of Spell Steal allows Rubick to be built differently. While he only has one innate disable, he should generally be built with mobility and casting in mind, with items that help with initiation taking priority due to the utility that Spell Steal provides.<br/>Despite his high base intelligence, Rubick suffers from mediocre intelligence growth, and his spells have relatively flat mana costs; additionally, consistent use of Spell Steal will further tax his mana pool due to the need to support not only his innate spells, but also any stolen abilities, particularly mana-expensive ultimates. The flat mana cost for his abilities means that they cost a larger fraction of his mana pool in the early game, and thus limits his operational time in the field. Items that grant Rubick a larger mana pool and increased mana regeneration are very helpful for keeping him in the game.<br/><br/>Although a great disabler and potential initiator with the right items and stolen spells, Rubick is still very frail and can be easily killed if caught out of position by the enemy team. Rubick should focus on building items that grant him more mobility rather than increasing the size of his HP pool, as increased mobility can help with both initiation and escape rather than simply delay his death in the face of enemy attacks.<br/><br/><br/>During the mid- and late-game, stealing key teamfight spells and keeping yourself alive should be your main goals. Spell Steal only has a 0.1 second cast time and high cast range, so quick fingers and fast reaction time will give your team a huge advantage.<br/><br/>Rubick is a very flexible caster who can be played as a support, roamer or core farmer. The role that he is selected for will largely change his how much farm he gets, and in turn how effective he can be with his abilities. However, his skill and item build remains largely the same.<br/>As a support, Rubick generally performs lane harassment and creep pulling duties, getting low farming and experience priority. Telekinesis allows him to catch the enemy off-laner and pull them back, as well as making chain-disables by his tri-lane easier to execute due to Telekinesis's ability to reposition the enemy precisely.<br/><br/>As a roamer, Rubick aims to disable and disposition enemies with Telekinesis, setting up kills for his lanes to give them an early advantage. A roaming Rubick prioritizes in mobility, disable and nuking.<br/><br/>As a core, Rubick goes to the mid lane, using Fade Bolt to nuke and harass, and Telekinesis to set up kills if his supports and roamers rotate to mid for a gank. Due to being given farm and experience priority, mid Rubick's goal is to get level 6 as fast as possible and use his gold and level advantage to start moving around the map for ganks and kills. Gold should be spent on mobility items, particularly a fast Blink Dagger, and utility and disable items to turn teamfights to his team's advantage.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Telekinesis</h4>Telekinesis stuns its target for a short duration, and allows Rubick to displace them with its Telekinesis Land sub-ability, stunning any enemies in the impact radius.<br/><br/>Telekinesis is a short disable, but can be extremely powerful as it can displace the enemy upon landing, putting them in a very disadvantageous position.<br/><br/>No matter what role Rubick is played in, at least one point should be spent on this ability in the laning stage. Because leveling it up increases its disable duration (both lift and stun on secondary targets) and cast range, this ability benefits from being maxed out early in a match in order to increase Rubick's disable potential.<br/><br/>Rubick is a very strong supporting disabler when placed in a side lane, since Telekinesis can disable a target for a disproportionate amount of time (lift time, as well as displacement upon landing). This allows him to greatly magnify the effects of chain disables by his team as he can prevent a target from dodging area-of-effect stuns and increase the length of their retreat path.<br/><br/>When using Telekinesis alongside allies with unreliable disables, always make sure to communicate your intentions beforehand. Telling your teammates that you will not displace the enemy with Telekinesis Land, or that you will always pull them backwards, will give them forewarning as to where to cast their stun. Not communicating can cause allies to miss their stun completely, resulting in a failed gank.<br/><br/>Remember that any enemies within a certain radius of a lifted target will be stunned upon the target landing. Telekinesis Land allows Rubick to select the area that the target will land in, allowing him to utilize the secondary stun as needed. This can be extremely powerful when counter-initiating during enemy ganks, as Rubick can immediately disable one attacker with the lift, and then stun any other enemy heroes with the land.<br/><br/>When choosing a location for Telekinesis Land, it is possible to place the target on a different elevation than their lift point. You can use this to your advantage by placing the target over a ridge, forcing them to take the long way around, which can be useful for extending a fleeing enemy's escape path or preventing a chasing enemy from easily pursuing. As well, targets can be placed on the elevated cliffs near the rune spots, trapping them in place for an easy kill.<br/><h4>Fade Bolt</h4>Fade Bolt is a bouncing nuke that deals a respectable amount of damage to enemies while also reducing the damage their physical attacks deal.<br/><br/>Due to its nuking power and attack damage reduction on targets, Fade Bolt can be a surprisingly effective counter-gank spell, as it will both deal damage to the enemy and reduce their attack damage, decreasing their chances of securing a kill with their attacks as well as their chances of surviving and escaping after the gank. It can be a useful spell to break up or at least hinder enemy gank attempts.<br/><br/>Fade Bolt can be a powerful harassing tool during laning, as not only does it deal damage but reduces the enemy's attack damage. However, mind its mana cost, and remember that casting it will push your lane both due to the nuke damage on nearby creeps and the reduced damage that the creeps will deal. Avoid spamming it unless you have a source of mana replenishment, as you may need your mana to cast Telekinesis instead.<br/><br/>With a Soul Ring; you can spam a level 4 Fade Bolt free of cost (150 mana) every 30 seconds, provided you have the heath regeneration to back it up.<br/><br/>Remember that Fade Bolt deals the greatest damage to the first target struck, and decreases in strength as it bounces to other enemies. Keep this in mind if trying to cast this spell to finish off an enemy, as the bounces may cause it to weaken to the point where it cannot guarantee a kill. If possible, try to directly target the enemy you are trying to kill in order to maximize the amount of damage they take.<br/><br/>Conversely, Fade Bolt's range can be augmented by using the bounce to hit an enemy at range. If a weakened enemy is out of range from being directly targeted, they can still possibly be finished off by a bounce as long as they are not already in the fog of war, and there are other units nearby that can be used as a relay.<br/><br/>Due to its nuking and pushing power, Fade Bolt is a useful tool for a mid-lane Rubick, as the damage can harass the enemy mid while reducing their last-hitting power. As well, pushing the creep wave into the enemy tower can keep them occupied when the runes spawn, and force them to last-hit against their tower, possibly reducing the amount of gold they get.<br/><h4>Null Field</h4>Null Field is a survivability aura that grants Rubick and all nearby allies increased magic resistance.<br/><br/>Null Field generally should not be picked up during the laning stage, as it does not scale well and reduces the damage of already weak magic nukes by small amounts. However, it should still be maxed out by level 14 as it can greatly improve teammates' survivability against magic nukes, particularly as it stacks alongside all other sources of magic resistance.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Null Field affects allied creeps, not just heroes. If pushing alongside creep waves, Rubick can increase the survivability of his lane against enemy magic nukes, forcing them to expend more effort to halt pushes. However, beware that the enemy can simply choose to jump on Rubick instead, so try to stay a respectable distance behind, and make sure that there are nearby teammates to back you up.<br/><h4>Spell Steal</h4>Spell Steal is one of the most powerful spells in the game, as used properly it can turn teamfights around completely. However, its use requires impeccable positioning, timing and judgment to ensure that the right spell is stolen and used at the right time. Keep in mind what abilities your enemies have, which of those you plan to steal, and in what situations the enemy will use those spells, so that you can be ready when an opportunity presents itself.<br/><br/>Spell Steal is one of the hardest spells in the game to use properly, as it requires extensive game knowledge to understand every aspect of the spells you are able to steal. As well, its long cooldown without Aghanim's Scepter means that there is no room for error if you intend on stealing a specific spell during a fight rather than taking what comes. In general, more experience playing as other heroes in the game translates to better understanding of how to best utilize Spell Steal, as you will understand all the aspects of the spells you are potentially stealing, as well as when enemies will cast those spells.<br/><br/>Virtually all spells stolen by Rubick will retain his 0.1 second cast animation. This means that spells such as Fissure, Ice Path and Split Earth will cast almost immediately. Any spell that requires channel time or extended casting animations such as Assassinate and Epicenter will still have extended durations.<br/><br/>Certain spells can be extremely powerful against the heroes that they are stolen from. For instance, if there is a Bounty Hunter on the enemy team, stealing Track from him allows Rubick to completely negate his Shadow Walk, as well as drastically increase Rubick's gold gain. Stealing Mystic Flare from Skywrath Mage can allow Rubick to destroy him in place by disabling him with Telekinesis, and so on.<br/><br/>Stolen spells can often fill in any deficiencies that Rubick has, allowing him to diversify greatly. For instance, stealing an area-of-effect magic nuke can allow Rubick to farm more easily as he can combine it with Fade Bolt, stealing a stun can allow him to double up disable duration when combined with Telekinesis, and so on.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that when chain-disabling with a stolen spell, you can steal another one immediately afterward if Spell Steal is off cooldown. For instance, ganking with a stolen Storm Hammer can stun an enemy for up to 4.25 seconds when combined with Telekinesis, but if the gank target has just used a stun (such as a Wraith King with Wraithfire Blast), Rubick can steal that and add it at the end, stunning the target for a maximum of 6.25 seconds.<br/><br/>While a stolen spell can be powerful by itself even factoring in the reduced cast times, Rubick's true strength comes from combining those spells with his innate ones. For instance, stealing Shackleshot can be extremely powerful as Rubick can lift a target at will and drop them next to a tree, stealing Enfeeble can drastically neuter a target's attack power when stacked with Fade Bolt, and so on.<br/><br/>Don't forget that stolen spells can synergize with allies' abilities as well, not only those of Rubick. If the enemy has a spell that can synergize well with that of a teammate, it can be very beneficial to attempt to steal that spell in tandem with an ally. For instance, if there is a Dark Seer on the opposing team and Disruptor on yours, stealing the Dark Seer's Vacuum can allow your Disruptor to get off a perfect Kinetic Field + Static Storm combo.<br/><br/>Remember that stolen spells have a memory duration based on the level of your ultimate, so you should keep in mind how you can best use that spell before you forget it. If you have stolen a powerful teamfight ultimate, it can be wise to try to force the enemy into a teamfight that is disadvantageous for them. If you have stolen a strong area of effect nuke, you can use it to farm during downtime or push out lanes. If you have stolen a strong stun, you should attempt to find a target to gank as you can greatly extend the duration of your disable by combining the stolen disable with Telekinesis.<br/><br/>It can be a good habit to mark the time at which you stole a spell via team notifications; Alt + click the spell you have stolen, then the clock to indicate when you stole it. As the buff duration for Spell Steal can be difficult to read, logging the time at which you stole a certain spell can let you know approximately when it will expire.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter not only reduces Spell Steal's cooldown to 2 seconds and increases its cast range, it also (in most cases) grants Rubick the upgrade benefits of any spells he has stolen, regardless of whether the original caster has an Aghanim's Scepter or not. Therefore, a stolen Black Hole will apply Enigma's current level of Midnight Pulse to the area, a stolen Heat-Seeking Missile will fire up to 4 rockets, and so on.<br/><h2>Items</h2><br/>Healing Salve and Tango should be purchased in most any situation, as basic regen prevents you from being harassed out of lane. The main exception is in the mid lane, where buying only Tangos can help if the aim is to get a fast Bottle.<br/><br/>When playing as a lane babysitter or roamer, having a Clarity or two can allow Rubick to utilize his spells more than a few times, as they are very costly in the early game.<br/><br/>Iron Branches give Rubick some much-needed attributes, especially to his Strength. They can be sold later, or turned into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>When not playing as the team's mid, ensure that your team has an Animal Courier, even if you have to be the one to purchase it.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are important to get early on as Rubick, as Telekinesis is a very powerful disable that requires Rubick to get close enough to cast.<br/><br/>Magic Wand gives Rubick stats, and more burst HP and mana regen with up to 255 instant replenishment for both. Even in the late game, this can be all that is needed to cast one more game-changing stolen spell in a fight.<br/><br/>Bracer is a good stat booster for a cheap price. It boosts Rubick's HP, giving him more survivability.<br/><br/>Ogre Club start up item from Aghanim's Scepter,boost up the Rubick HP bar, increases Rubick's survivability.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Arcane Boots are very useful on Rubick due to his ability to steal the enemy's spells. They increase the size of his mana pool and allow him to replenish his and allies' mana as needed.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a crucial item to purchase on Rubick, and should be rushed if possible. Being able to instantly reposition himself greatly increases Rubick's survivability, as well as his ability to jump in and use Spell Steal, or any spells stolen by it, when the opportunity presents itself.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter drastically increases Rubick's teamfight contribution, as he can potentially steal an enemy spell every 2 seconds and use it against them. The increased stats buff up both Rubick's health and mana pools, and the increased cast range can give him the ability to steal a spell safely without using his Blink Dagger. As well, he can utilize the upgrades granted by Aghanim's Scepter to any stolen spells.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important on Rubick because of his ability to steal and use enemy spells. Due to this flexibility, he can save a teammate using a stolen spell, or bring a huge teamfight ultimate to a fight.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance can be upgraded from a purchased Bracer, and gives Rubick stats across the board, most importantly Strength and Intelligence.<br/><br/>No matter whether playing as a core or support Rubick, it is important to regularly purchase Observer Wards in order to give your team map vision. As well, having knowledge of the enemy's movements allows you to identify which spell they last cast, giving you forearmed knowledge of what you will get when using your ultimate.<br/><br/>Played in a hard support role, be sure to purchase Sentry Wards regularly on top of Observer Wards, as denying the enemy map vision can give you leeway for initiating on them and stealing their spells.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Scythe of Vyse allows Rubick to instantly disable an enemy, adding to his already powerful arsenal of disables. It also greatly increases the size of his mana pool and gives him a hefty amount of mana regeneration, greatly increasing his ability to cast mana-expensive stolen spells.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard increases the size of Rubick's mana pool, and gives him great survivability against physical damage. As well, the active can be helpful while initiating, as it can slow enemies down long enough for you to get within range of them to disable or steal their spells.<br/><br/>Boots of Travelgreatly improve Rubick's mobility, and frees up an inventory slot. It is useful for globally repositioning to show up to teamfights or ganks with powerful stolen spells.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos greatly improves both Rubick's health pool and mana pool, allowing him to do more in teamfights. As well, the active ability can be used to root an enemy from a very long distance away, helpful for fleeing from single enemies or catching foes out of position for further disables.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a good utility support item to pick up, as it can outright shield allies from magic damage rather than blunting the edge with Null Field. The increased HP regeneration helps Rubick to maintain his health pool somewhat, while the increased magic resistance (from the item as well as the aura) gives him and his teammates further survivability against magic nukes as it stacks multiplicatively with Null Field.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a comparatively cheap item that will give you great mana regen, a bigger mana pool, more movement speed for mobility, as well as a useful disable. The active can also be used on yourself to disjoint enemy spells you wish to grab, or remove debuffs such as silence from yourself.<br/><br/>Force Staff serves a very similar purpose to Blink Dagger for Rubick with the added benefits of more Intelligence and HP regen. It is much easier to build, and can serve either as a supplementary repositioning tool after Blink Dagger, or a cheaper substitute if you are having trouble farming. Also unlike Blink Dagger, it can be used on teammates to give them additional mobility for initiation or escape, and can be used on enemies to disposition them or break their Linken's Sphere before casting a disable on them.<br/><br/>Bloodstone can be built by disassembling already-purchased Arcane Boots. Rubick's mana pool is normally strained to the limit in any situation, but may be more so if he intends to steal highly expensive or spammable spells such as Mystic Flare, Crypt Swarm, and so on. Bloodstone gives Rubick both mana and HP, enhancing his survivability as well as giving him a regenerating source of mana for continuing to cast spells.<br/><br/>Flying Courier should be purchased if playing as a laning support Rubick, and nobody else on the team has upgraded the courier yet.<br/><br/>Faerie Fire can be a strong consumable to purchase as mid Rubick. It grants a small amount of bonus damage, increasing last-hitting power, and can be consumed as a last-second life-saver in the event of an enemy gank.<br/><br/>A starting Null Talisman is greatly beneficial on a mid Rubick, as it gives him more last-hitting power to allow him to compete against the enemy mid. If needed, it can be upgraded into a Veil of Discord depending on the situation.<br/><br/>Bottle can be crucial to purchase early on as a mid Rubick as well. It allows him to replenish his HP and mana to go toe-to-toe against his lane opponent, using his spells to disable and nuke as needed. Past the laning stage, it can fuel Rubick's mana pool to allow him to utilize stolen spells to their utmost.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is an unorthodox item to build on Rubick, but can be useful as a roamer. While his base intelligence is respectable, his spells come on a fairly low cooldown, and his mana pool is often strained to the breaking point due to Spell Steal allowing him to utilize even more spells. A Soul Ring can give Rubick on-demand mana that allows him to cast one or two more spells in a teamfight, and can help mitigate the mana cost on his spells when using them to farm, making sure that he does not show up to fights with a half-depleted mana pool. As well, it can be used as a component for building a Bloodstone should the need arise.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows can serve as a useful utility and survivability item when playing as a roamer. The extra strength gives you more HP while the mana regen bonus helps to maintain your mana pool. The item's active adds another damage nuke to the mix, or can be used to heal yourself or teammates after successful ganks.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are generally not very strong on Rubick, but can be situationally built as a support or roamer. The armor and passive HP regen help to give Rubick survivability, and the increased base movement speed allows him to position himself for casting his spells more easily.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is a useful item to purchase on any support, and is no exception for Rubick. Being able to become immune to physical damage can buy Rubick more time in the face of the enemy's carries to steal or cast stolen spells in order to change the course of a teamfight.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a situational item that mainly provides utility, but can be very strong if used properly. The active can allow Rubick to initiate by walking in invisibly instead of using his Blink Dagger, or can be used to shield himself or an ally from enemy magic nukes (or to help them escape), augmented further with Null Field. It can be particularly useful for utilizing stolen channeling spells, as it helps to prevent easy interruption.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord can be a useful utility item to purchase. It provides a large amount of intelligence to boost Rubick's mana pool, additional HP and armor, and the active ability can work alongside Null Field to create a space for magic damage to benefit your team over the enemy. It can be useful depending on what types of spells can be stolen from the enemy, as well as if your team also has a plethora of magic nukes.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is a strong purchase that can be easily acquired by disassembling Arcane Boots for the Energy Booster component. Besides the increased mana pool, it gives Rubick HP regen for increased survivability, and increases the cast range of all of Rubick's spells, particularly Telekinesis and Spell Steal, giving him increased disable range and allowing him to safely steal spells from far away (as well as utilize any successfully stolen spells from greater range). The spell damage amplification also allows him to deal more damage with any stolen magic nukes.<br/><br/>Solar Crest is a strong support item that can greatly benefit Rubick's team. By itself, the item grants scaling mana regen as well as survivability against enemy physical attacks due to a combination of armor and evasion, which can be useful as Null Field already protects him against magic nukes. The active is very strong since it can allow Rubick to transfer the armor and evasion to his carry, or can reduce the armor of a gank target during an initiation with Telekinesis.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is a very situational item to purchase, and should depend on if the enemy has a major teamfight ultimate that can benefit from it. However, as with a Refresher Orb purchased on any hero with a major teamfight ultimate, it can mean the difference between victory and defeat in the right situation.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Demon is an excellent defensive support capable of resetting fights, counter-initiating, and dealing with blinks and magic-immunity. His Disruption working well as a way to break up chain stuns as well as set up an ally's stun, debuffing the enemy with Soul Catcher is a 50% damage increase, while his ultimate Demonic Purge slows and dispels enemies even through magic immunity.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Magic immunity piercing debuffs<br/><br/>Chain stun breaker<br/><br/>Excellent gank setup<br/><br/>Wave clear and tower push with Shadow Poison and Disruption illusions<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No hard crowd control<br/><br/>Offers little sustain in and after fights<br/><br/>Nuke requires time to build up damage<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>In most scenarios, Shadow Demon's combo goes like this: Initiate on a lonesome enemy with Disruption; use Shadow Poison to disable their Blink Dagger should they have one, use Soul Catcher on top of it to amplify the damage taken, use Demonic Purge when the enemy pops out of Disruption, and attempt stacking more poison on them during the slow period. The combo can be repeated if you have Aghanim's Scepter.<h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Disruption</h4>Disruption has many good uses. One way is to save an ally after they get caught (e.g. by a stun) and save them from damage they would otherwise take, as well as prevent the enemy from stacking disables. Another use is to set up a gank: use Disruption, and then your allies can position themselves closer to the target, as well as set up spells that require aiming, or has a delay.<br/><br/>Disruption, as most banishes, is a very versatile skill, that has this unfortunate flaw it can do more harm than good to your team than good, in the wrong hands.<br/><br/>Like Eul's Scepter of Divinity, it is a perfect setup for unreliable stuns such as Leshrac's Split Earth, Lina's Light Strike Array or Kunkka's Torrent. Like Eul's, it is perfect to waste 2.5 seconds of an opponent's precious buff, such as Dazzle's Shallow Grave or Abaddon's Borrowed Time.<br/><br/>Unlike Eul's, it won't purge an enemy of a long-lasting buff like Empower or Bloodlust... But you have Demonic Purge for that.<br/><br/>Unlike Eul's, it can be used on allies to save them from opponents' initiation or even their finishing blow. Thus you can save an ally and turn a fight around by banishing him from a predictable Reaper's Scythe or even a Finger of Death or a Laguna Blade. The same can be said for Outworld Devourer's Astral Imprisonment.<br/><br/>In return, however, and for the same reasons, it can also serve as the perfect initiation tool for the enemy team!<br/><br/>Disruption also creates two very strong illusions of the target, making Shadow Demon very dangerous against illusion based heroes such as Terrorblade and Phantom Lancer. If the target is an enemy, the illusions will automatically attack it. These same heroes will also work as your best partners when besieging the opponent's high ground at little to no risk. Special mention goes to Centaur Warrunner whose illusions benefit from his Return passive, damaging the towers for a considerable amount should they (automatically) target the illusions.<br/><br/>Plenty of heroes have an escape mechanism that can render your illusions useless after the disruption ( Blink, Leap, Pounce...), if no ally on your team has any follow up stun or silence, you may be better off leaving it at that instead of wasting your mana on extra spells. But you can also control the illusions to target a different opponent, or even push out the lane and farm. In the early game, the illusions spawned can also serve to fully block an opponent that would be trying to hide or juke in the trees, or that would be carelessly walking close to a wall. Hypothetically, you should even be able to fully block an opponent by your lonesome self with just the help of an Iron Branch: the enemy would be blocked between yourself, two illusions and a temporary tree. You cannot block someone with only yourself plus the illusions and no extra border.<br/><br/>If you are facing a hero with a strong orb effect like Anti-Mage in the lane, use Disruption on them often and force them to flee from the illusions.<br/><br/>Disruption can be used to help teammates land spells with long cast times or delays. Examples include skills such as Torrent, Sacred Arrow, Light Strike Array and even Sun Strike or Slithereen Crush. When combined with Soul Catcher, this makes for a powerful ganking combination.<br/><br/>Check illusions of enemies created by Disruption. You can get useful information such as their skill build and item build.<br/><br/>Finally, the illusions can be very useful for heroes that tend to build a lot of auras, most notably a radiance, since your illusions will benefit from it, turning the enemy's radiance against them.<br/><h4>Soul Catcher</h4>Soul Catcher is extremely strong skill at all stages of the game, and arguably Shadow demon's only skill that scales well into the late game. However, its search radius is fairly large and if you use it in the middle of a creep wave, odds are it won't hit your intended target.<br/><br/>Though it's tempting to always use it after disruption as part of your general combo, always use it by itself when you have any kind of opportunity as it tremendously increases your and your team's damage output and the duration lasts as long as the cooldown anyway.<br/><br/>Soul Catcher synergizes extremely well with single-target nukes, such as Finger of Death, Laguna Blade, or Dagon.<br/><br/>Soul Catcher is extremely effective in conjunction with Pure damage spells since they ignore any kind of magic armor and are amplified.<br/><h4>Shadow Poison</h4>Shadow Poison is Shadow Demon's only directly damage spell outside of his ultimate and has the potential to deal 1040 damage before reductions when maxed although it does take some time to set up. Shadow poison is at its strongest in drawn out fights where Shadow Demon can stand in the backlines debilitating his foes with his spells and spam it out. Unlike the rest of his spells Shadow Poison IS DISPELLABLE, however, it always deals its damage when the debuff is removed, no matter how. Shadow poison will always disable Blink Dagger on hit and can do so against enemies in Disruption because of this it is especially good at keeping blink heroes from countering your initiation or push such as Sand King, Earthshaker, or Tidehunter. Shadow Poison gives flying vision over its area during travel time and can be used to deward up cliffs and scout out jukes and ganks.<br/><br/>Shadow Poison becomes much more lethal when stacked up to 5, with this, you can destroy enemy heroes in the lane, even in the earliest stages. However, the mana cost is great and you should learn to control your mana or buy mana-boosting items for you to perform.<br/><br/>Be wary if your opponent has a Magic Stick or Magic Wand, as the charges provided by poison will help him sustain in lane and potentially turn a gank around, and poison is very easy to dodge if you keep an eye on shadow demon. However, also remember that an opponent needs vision of you as you're casting the spell to get the charge, and it's well worth a stick charge to cancel a Clarity or Healing Salve as you can do so from a safe distance.<br/><br/>Shadow Poison fully works on invisible heroes, and it can be your safest way to secure a kill without diving a tower. Since the damage doubles on each stack of poison, it's only interesting to keep the stacks on a fleeing opponent (that could potentially heal while you try to chase) if you think you can get at least 3 stacks on him. If you can only get two, it will damage for the same amount as two stacks of one. In lane however, you have a full ten seconds between each stack to try to add them up to 4 or 5, forcing him to run away. If the opponent is melee and tries to go for a last hit, there is your opportunity to add another stack on him.<br/><br/>Though an opponent needs to be extra careless to allow 4-5 stacks of poison to stack up on him, the same can't be said for creeps. In a passive game, you can easily farm the jungle with poison, speeding up the process as you level it. It's also a reliable tool to double or even triple stack certain camps (and farm those stacks too): the poison will activate by itself after ten seconds so you can use it once on a far away camp around :43 so it will aggro you at :53 and stack; use another on a nearby camp that you don't have vision of at :53; and stack the one in front of you with a right click at :55. You can't be too far away from the first camp you're trying to stack or else it will not aggro you when the poison activates, making the whole triple-stack process rather tricky.<br/><br/>Similarly, should you find a bit of space to farm in lane, poison will help you stay behind/safer and farm/push out the lane faster<br/><h4>Demonic Purge</h4>Demonic Purge is an extremely strong magic immunity piercing skill that is most effective versus heroes that want to be in the midst of a fight with magic immunity such as Luna, Sven, Lifestealer or Ursa. In addition to the potent slow, Demonic Purge will live up to its name and remove any friendly buffs placed on the target such as Warcry, Bloodlust, Repel, Guardian Angel, Surge and a variety of item buffs such as Mask of Madness, Satanic, and Ghost Scepter. Aghanim's Scepter grants an enormous increase in potency by giving Shadow Demon a potentially 15 second magic immunity piercing slow and dispel. Aghanim's Scepter also gives Demonic Purge the Break debuff which disables enemy passives for the duration of the spell.<br/><br/>A Diffusal Blade can be used for much the same purposes as Demonic Purge, while having up to 16 charges (After using all the charges and buying a new recipe, and excluding any Diffusal Blades you might obtain in the future exhausting all charges possible). However, it does not go through Black King Bar (Or other similar time-based spell immunity, such as Rage) and it does not apply a Break. Consider it a possible alternative if Aghanim's Scepter is too costly and/or you need to purge multiple targets at once, but wish to save your ultimate for the one with the highest priority.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Iron Branches provide cheap stats, and can later be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>A Mantle of Intelligence gives Shadow Demon additional intelligence to cast more spells.<br/><br/>A set of Tangoes is useful for health regeneration early in the game. A Tango from the set can also be shared with the team's carry, allowing them to stay longer in the lane.<br/><br/>If Shadow Demon takes significant burst damage, a Healing Salve allows him to quickly get back into action.<br/><br/>Shadow Demon is mostly played as a heavy support and as such is usually in charge to get at the very least an Animal Courier and a couple of Observer Wards.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick provides crucial burst health and mana, especially if the enemies in lane are constantly casting their abilities.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed give Shadow Demon the mobility he needs for ganking and escaping.<br/><br/>The starting Mantle can be built into a Null Talisman for additional stats.<br/><br/>Don't hesitate to get a Smoke of Deceit as a way to get closer to your enemy for your disruption. You'll be lucky to catch an enemy on whom you have an actual kill potential if you simply walk up to him.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>The Magic Stick and Ironwood Branches can be upgraded into a Magic Wand, freeing up inventory space for additional core items.<br/><br/>Repeated uses of Shadow Poison will quickly drain Shadow demon's mana, and Arcane Boots provide additional mana pool and consistent regeneration for this purpose.<br/><br/>The versatile Town Portal Scroll allows Shadow Demon to rapidly escape from danger, defend towers, join teamfights, or set up ganks.<br/><br/>All his spells benefit from an Aether Lens, especially disruption which has a fairly low cast range. The health regen provided by it also allows you to sustain in lane or while you farm the jungle with poison.<br/><br/>The break provided by Aghanim's Scepter as well as the two extra charges are well worth the cost and you should always consider it at one point or another.<br/><br/>Shadow Demon suffers from no mobility, so a Force Staff is a perfect choice on him, a typical support item, to either reposition, run away, chase, initiate or save an ally.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational Items:</b><br/>Pipe of Insight gives very good health regeneration. More importantly, it allows Shadow Demon to cast a magic-resistant shield on nearby allies, extending their longevity in teamfights.<br/><br/>If the slow provided by Demonic Purge is insufficient, a Shiva's Guard will give an additional area-of-effect slow. The Freezing Aura, increased armor, and provided intelligence give Shadow Demon greatly increased sustainability in teamfights.<br/><br/>The minions summoned by the Necronomicon are useful for pushing towers as well as focusing Soul Catcher's affected target. The strength and intelligence that come with it are an additional boon. Necronomicon's lvl 3 Warrior also has true sight, which is really helpful if enemies have invisible heroes.<br/><br/>Mekansm Burst health regen and armor, if used correctlyc can instantly turn the tide of teamfights in your favor.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity enables Shadow Demon to use Cyclone as a second pseudo-banish, as well as providing crucial mana regeneration.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a viable pick in certain situations as good positioning is vital to Shadow Demon, allowing you to stay at the back and avoid possible initiation/focus and, in some situations, even counter-initiate.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter provides another defense mechanism that is quite often needed against right-clickers such as Phantom Assassin however it may not be a viable pick against heroes that tend to get a Diffusal Blade.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a similar decent choice, as it gives you an extra purge to work with, which can help remove a Surge or a Guardian Angel. The 20 ms provided by the Wind Lace makes it a good starting item too, and the mana regen is always nice to help you farm with poison.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is an unusual choice on Shadow Demon. Though it can help to setup ganks with disruption, don't forget it also gives time to the enemy team to react, most notably on your fragile self. Also the 2.5sec banish might not be enough for your team to follow if they don't have a mobility item of their own. A strong point in favor of Blink Dagger is you can blink out of disruption if you're caught, provided you can wait 0.5sec without taking damage.<br/><br/>Dagon If you play a core Shadow Demon (in the mid position most likely), as its damage is amplified by soul catcher, plus whatever spell amp you may get from your int stat. As a theoretical scenario, a dagon 5 and three charges of demonic purge amplified add up to 3,000 magical damage before reductions and spell amp (1.5 * (800 + 3 * 400)). The burst damage from dagon is unlikely to be evaded, unlike the slow, build-up damage from poison or demonic purge.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is extremely strong on Shadow Demon. You can use it immediately after Disruption (no cast time), allowing your illusions to hit their target with ease, and should net a kill for you if you used the rest of your kit. However, as good as it is, don't forget it is extremely expensive and most games will be well over before you manage to farm it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Shadow Shaman is a very powerful ganker and pusher, who possesses very strong disables and nukes. His spells allow him to disable lone enemies for extended periods of time, making them easy prey for his teammates, or to make short work of creep waves and towers.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Strong early game nukes<br/><br/>Long duration disables<br/><br/>Works well with almost any hero<br/><br/>Can splitpush lanes and take towers quickly<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very mana dependent<br/><br/>No escape mechanism<br/><br/>Low mobility<br/><br/>More item and level dependent than other supports<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>Because of his strong disables and powerful nukes, Shadow Shaman benefits greatly from building intelligence items that extend the size of his mana pool and provide mana regen, as well as mobility items to allow him to get close enough to cast his disables and nukes on enemies. The additional mobility also aids in survivability by allowing him to re-position himself to escape enemy attempts to kill him.<br/><br/>Because Shadow Shaman's disables are all unit-targeted, they can reliably disable enemies if he gets close enough to them. However, this also means that they can be easily negated by Linken's Sphere or even reflected with Lotus Orb, so be sure to check the enemy's inventory prior to committing expensive disables.<br/><br/>Rhasta can be played as either a support or a core. His farm priority mainly dictates how effective he can be in either role, with small differences in how he is played.<br/>As a support, Shadow Shaman should focus on babysitting his team's safe lane carry, and setting up kills with his disables when rotating for ganks. As he has two hard disables, getting close enough to a lone enemy can often ensure a kill if his teammates have enough damage output.<br/><br/>In general, if Shadow Shaman is played as a core, he is played as a solo mid where he can get fast levels to make use of his spells early on. A mid Shadow Shaman should focus on maxing out Ether Shock to farm and harass, push out the lane to clear the way to grabbing a rune, and attempt to get kills on the enemy mid once he is level 6.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Ether Shock</h4>Ether Shock is a powerful damage nuke that must be unit targeted, hitting nearby enemy units according to its level.<br/><br/>Ether Shock is very inefficient at level 1, only hitting a single target, so it is most profitably cast only when it is level 3 or higher. Depending on how Shadow Shaman is played, it should either be maxed first for the nuke damage, or ignored in favor of maxing out his disables.<br/><br/>The high damage and low cooldown on Ether Shock allows Shadow Shaman to make quick work of creep waves and neutral camps. Given a steady source of mana regen, Shadow Shaman can flash-farm with the spell while simultaneously pushing or counter-pushing lanes, threatening the enemy's towers and taking away map control.<br/><br/>When casting Ether Shock to nuke creep waves, remember that it can hit enemies at twice the cast range and the area is largest at the far end. Try to target the spell on the middle of an enemy creep wave, and position Shadow Shaman in such a way as to concentrate as many creeps on the far end as possible.<br/><h4>Hex</h4>Hex disables the target enemy instantly, inflicting a silence and mute while drastically cutting down their movement speed.<br/><br/>Hex is a potent disable since it will instantly hard-disable its target and eliminates their ability to cast spells or use items. In general at least one early level should be taken, but other levels may be forgone in favor of other abilities depending on the build.<br/><br/>Hex should always be the spell that Shadow Shaman uses to initiate a gank, as its instant cast time prevents the target from reacting. Following disables can be targeted on the enemy at leisure in order to secure a kill.<br/><br/>Unlike other hex-type abilities, Shadow Shaman's Hex reduces the target's base movement speed down to 100, rather than 140. This makes the enemy slightly easier to hit with unreliable follow-up disables such as Split Earth or Torrent.<br/><h4>Shackles</h4>Shackles is a powerful channeled disable that can stun its target for up to 5 seconds.<br/><br/>As with Hex, at least one early level of Shackles should be taken to maximize Shadow Shaman's disable potential. A single point in the ability allows Shadow Shaman to disable an enemy for almost 3 seconds while dealing nuke damage.<br/><br/>While Shackles has a lower cast range than Hex and requires channeling, it also stuns its target for the duration of the channel, preventing it from moving. The longer disable duration also allows teammates to otherwise utilize powerful follow-up disables and nukes, such as Stasis Trap and Ghostship, which might otherwise be dodged.<br/><br/>Priority between Hex and Shackles should depend on team composition, however Shackles is generally the better disable to max out first as its mana cost scales better and it can deal damage for the duration of the channel. If your teammates have reliable damage output, holding the target in place for up to 5 seconds can allow them to deal large amounts of damage. However, keep in mind that unlike Hex, Shackles can be interrupted by silencing or stunning Shadow Shaman, so it is not as useful if there is a nearby enemy who can interrupt you.<br/><br/>Shackles deals its damage in a large number of small instances. This makes it a very strong ability for instantly shredding protective abilities like Refraction and Living Armor.<br/><br/>When possible, try to take advantage of Shackles' extremely short cooldown. If it is cast as an initiating disable, its channeling time will allow half of its cooldown duration to pass, and a follow-up Hex can hard-disable the target for an additional 3.5 seconds, leaving the enemy free for only 1.5 seconds before Shackles comes off cooldown.<br/><br/>Because it is a channeled spell, shift-queuing other disables during Shackles can allow them to be instantly cast once the channel duration ends. This can be useful for denying the enemy any openings in disable duration to take advantage of.<br/><h4>Mass Serpent Ward</h4>Mass Serpent Ward summons ten snake wards that deal piercing damage to their targets.<br/><br/>Serpent wards can make short work of incoming creep waves and deal tremendous amounts of damage to enemy towers over their long duration. Placing the wards on top of a tower that is being pushed can make quick work of it so long as the enemy is unable to attack and destroy them.<br/><br/>Rhasta's Mass Serpent Wards can be commanded. Beginners often neglect to control them, but even if Rhasta is dead he can have a big impact on a fight with intelligent use of his wards.<br/><br/>Beware that while Mass Serpent Wards can deal large amounts of damage, they are also very easy to destroy with attacks, so be careful about when and where they are placed. Enemies that can isolate the wards can make quick work of them, wasting the spell and feeding gold to the enemy team.<br/><br/>One of the most important features of Mass Serpent Ward is the box figure they are placed in. This allows Shadow Shaman to place the wards right on top of an enemy hero, trapping them in place if they do not have any mobility spells or items to displace themselves.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Mass Serpent Wards can be used to defend against pushes. Their striking power allows them to quickly kill creeps that are trying to approach the tower, and discourage the enemy from pushing.<br/><br/>The splash damage dealt by Mass Serpent Wards is registered as magical damage. Against clumped up enemies, it can be beneficial to try to hit adjacent targets in order to deal magical splash damage to the primary target, as direct serpent ward attacks deal minimal damage to heroes with lots of armor.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tangos are generally required when playing safe lane support. If playing mid, it is better to forgo the Healing Salve and aim for a fast Bottle.<br/><br/>Clarity is essential in ensuring that you have mana to cast your disables in the laning stage. Being able to get off both of your disables in a gank go a long way towards ensuring successful kills.<br/><br/>Iron Branches are good for cheap stats, and can be sold for inventory space or built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>When playing as a support, ensure that the Animal Courier is purchased at the start of the match.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick ensures that Rhasta has burst regen available when needed. 150 mana is enough to cast Hex if it is level 2 or lower, same for Shackles.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are important in allowing Shadow Shaman to close the gap with a target and disable them. Acquiring Boots before your opponents can often make the difference between getting a kill.<br/><br/>Bracer gives Rhasta some more HP, which is something he needs badly as he is very squishy otherwise.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand has all the benefits of Magic Stick, as well as more stats and a higher amount of burst regen. It is important no matter whether Shadow Shaman is played as a core or support.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots increases the size of Shadow Shaman's mana pool and gives him some burst mana regen; Rhasta often casts his spells as a combo, so he tends to run out very quickly if not furnished with a means of mana regen.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter should generally be considered a core item on a farming Rhasta, but luxury for a support Rhasta. The upgrade it grants Mass Serpent Ward greatly increases the amount of damage they can do, allowing Rhasta to make short work of heroes that have been boxed in or obliterate towers alarmingly quickly.<br/><br/>As a support, Shadow Shaman should regularly purchase Observer Wards in order to provide map vision for his team.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is extremely important on all heroes. In Shadow Shaman's case, showing up to teamfights, ganks and counter-ganks to cast his disables can change the tide of battle.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Refresher Orb allows for two instances of Mass Serpent Wards, which is hugely useful for siege damage and encounters.<br/><br/>Bloodstone is a very powerful item on Shadow Shaman as it greatly alleviates his mana dependence and gives him more HP for increased survivability. This can allow him to do more in teamfights before running out of mana or dying.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Shadow Shaman a much larger mana pool, as well as armor for survivability. The active can be used to slow enemies down on top of his other disables, further contributing to his teamfight potential.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is very powerful on Rhasta as he can use the warriors either to help his Mass Serpent Wards during pushes, add more firepower to a teamfight, or focus down a Shackle victim while Rhasta channels.<br/><br/>If playing as a support, try to purchase the Flying Courier as soon as possible so that your team can benefit from faster item deliveries during the laning stage.<br/><br/>Bottle is very important to purchase early on as a mid Shadow Shaman. It provides him with HP and mana replenishment, allowing him to profligately cast Ether Shock to farm, push and harass the enemy.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is a situational purchase but can help a support Shadow Shaman to maintain his mana pool more efficiently. Having an extra 150 mana on demand can go a long way towards having enough to cast a full round of disables.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows can be useful on a ganking Shadow Shaman over a Bracer. It gives him the same amount of strength, making him less squishy, and the mana regen helps to maintain his mana pool. As he is a very strong ganker, Shadow Shaman can roam and get charges easily, using them for additional Pure damage in later ganks or to keep himself and his teammates at full HP for more pushing potential.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are a situational alternative to Arcane Boots as a support Shadow Shaman. Not only are they cheaper, but they provide additional armor for survivability and increased movement speed for positioning for casting disables on the enemy. The passive HP regen also helps ensure that Shadow Shaman is at full health at the beginning of fights.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a very useful item, as Mass Serpent Wards deal physical damage. Placing the armor debuff on an enemy after boxing them in with the wards will make short work out of almost any hero. As well, the active can be used on teammates to give them more armor, or on Roshan to make taking the Aegis easier. It can also be upgraded into a Solar Crest to augment its bonuses even more.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is useful to purchase on squishy casters like Shadow Shaman. Giving himself invulnerability to physical damage can buy time if the enemy attempts to focus down Shadow Shaman with physical attacks, allowing him to retaliate with his disables and nukes.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a strong utility item that benefits Shadow Shaman in many aspects. It can be used to help with initiation by allowing Rhasta to approach enemies invisibly, and allows him to protect teammates that are caught out of position by casting invisibility on them. The invisibility also allows Shadow Shaman to protect himself while channeling Shackles on an enemy, reducing the chances of being disabled by unit-targeted spells.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger should be considered a core item on Shadow Shaman, no matter what role he is played in. Blink Dagger allows Shadow Shaman to instantly jump on top of a gank target and disable them with Hex, preventing them from reacting during ganks. It should be rushed as quickly as possible as a core, and given priority to obtain as a support.<br/><br/>Force Staff is an inferior but potent substitute for Blink Dagger. The extra intelligence gives Shadow Shaman more mana, and the active can be used on enemies and allies, not just on Shadow Shaman himself. Purchased as a supplement to Blink Dagger, it can also be used to break Linken's Sphere on a particularly slippery enemy player, or on Roshan prior to casting other disables.<br/><br/>Aether Lens is extremely powerful in Shadow Shaman's hands, and can be easily obtained through disassembling Arcane Boots. Besides granting some HP regen for additional survivability, the cast range increase allows Rhasta to disable enemies from farther away, making him a much bigger threat in ganks and fights.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a powerful item on Shadow Shaman. The item itself grants Shadow Shaman more mobility, rectifying his poor base movement speed, and gives him more intelligence as well as powerful scaling mana regen to fuel his costly and spammable spells. Most importantly, however, the active can be used to instantly disable an enemy from range and then place Mass Serpent Wards on top of them, easily boxing them in.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a good utility item to purchase. It gives Shadow Shaman more intelligence, allowing him to cast spells more often, and the additional HP makes him less squishy. The long range on the active also allows Shadow Shaman to slow enemies from a great distance, adding yet another disable to his repertoire.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very powerful late-game item to purchase. On top of the extra stats, much larger mana pool, and scaling mana regen, the instant Hex can serve as a complement to Rhasta's innate spell, giving him the ability to hard-disable a single target for up to 12 seconds.<br/><br/>Octarine Core gives Shadow Shaman many strong benefits. It gives him more HP and mana, and reduces the cooldowns on all of his abilities, making him a much bigger threat with his spammable nukes and disables. The spell lifesteal allows him to maintain his HP through Shackles and Ether Shock, particularly the latter which can deal tremendous amounts of magical damage to grouped enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Silencer is an intelligence-based teamfight-oriented hero that scales exceptionally well thanks to his innate ability Intelligence Steal. He is able to render any magic user useless with his Last Word and Arcane Curse. His signature ultimate, Global Silence can make a swift table turns in teamfight.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Can steal 2 intelligence for every hero he killed or die nearby him.<br/><br/>Can be played either as a support or as a carry.<br/><br/>Can harass enemies in the lane effectively.<br/><br/>Deals pure damage with Glaives of Wisdom.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Has no real "instant" silence besides his ultimate.<br/><br/>Has no escape abilities and is easy to gank.<br/><br/>Weakness against Black King Bar limits his effectiveness as a carry.<br/><br/>Is less effective if he didn't have a good early game and didn't steal enough intelligence.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Silencer can be played as a carry or support. As a carry, he focuses on taking fights and getting kills and assists with his spells, dealing tremendous damage with his auto-attacks while using his spells to prevent the enemy from easily retaliating. As a support, he focuses on harassing the enemy with his spells and building support-utility items while reserving his ultimate for major teamfights.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arcane Curse</h4>Arcane Curse is a decent harass spell as it costs little mana to use and can either prevent enemies from casting spells for a while and deal some damage, or force the enemy to take much more damage if they dare to cast spells during it. Its area-of-effect nature and high cast range allow Silencer to apply the debuff to multiple enemy heroes at once, or cast it from a safe range by edging the enemy with the far end of the effect radius.<br/><br/>The spell has a pseudo-silence-like effect on enemies; Although enemies are free to cast spells, they take a penalty for doing so, taking more and more damage from the curse for each cast they do.<br/><br/>In teamfights, harassing the enemy with Arcane Curse before the engagement can severely change the outcome of a battle, depending on what the hit enemies decide to do: Either they hesitate to cast spells in order to prevent its duration from stacking up, or they decide to cast spells and therefore take much more damage and possibly die to the long duration of the curse they stack up. This is especially effective against heroes who heavily spam their abilities in fights, like Bristleback or Batrider, dealing either tons of damage to them, or rendering them useless in a fight for several seconds.<br/><br/>Try to cast Arcane Curse on enemies before they cast their spells when laning. This ensures that they take much more damage from the spell or possible prevent them from farming if they use spells to do it. In some cases, it is even possible to apply the curse on enemies during their cast times, but this only works against abilities with a long cast time (e.g. Fissure) and requires quick reaction from the player.<br/><br/>The slow from Arcane Curse can place the enemy in a disadvantageous position as they are unable to easily chase or escape without taking more damage. Choosing to not cast a spell prevents them from decisively nuking or disabling.. This can cause enemies to reconsider their options, as choosing to continue engaging the enemy can lead to them being slowed and taking damage for longer, while choosing to disengage removes them from play anyways as they cannot re-engage easily because of the slow.<br/><br/>The slow can hinder melee carries who depend on movement speed in order to prevent themselves from being kited.<br/><h4>Glaives of Wisdom</h4>Glaives of Wisdom is what allows Silencer to become a powerful right-click carry, normally something that intelligence heroes cannot do. As its Pure damage scales with Silencer's intelligence, he can inflict large amounts of damage with his auto-attacks by building up enough intelligence, whether through farming items or via Intelligence Steal.<br/>In the laning stage, it may be beneficial to get one early level of Glaives of Wisdom, as Silencer can deal around 8-10 bonus Pure damage with an attack, useful for last-hitting as a carry. As well, the attack modifier can be manually cast to harass the enemy without drawing creep aggro, whether as a support or carry.<br/><br/><h4>Last Word</h4>Last Word curses Silencer's target to be faced with unfortunate consequences. If they cast a spell during the debuff duration, they are immediately silenced and take damage, useful for breaking the spell combo of enemies like Tiny and Tinker.<br/><br/>Last Word's silence proc follows the same rule as Arcane Curse, and only procs on spells requiring mana or which are not toggle-able.<br/><br/>In general, Last Word is used best against spell casters, as they suffer the most from the silence. Physical attack carries do not often have to cast numerous spells, however<br/><br/>Last Word is a powerful harassing spell in-lane, as it can force the enemy to retreat from the lane even if they do not cast a spell. If the enemy does not retreat, they are silenced near the creep wave, allowing them to be chased down and killed.<br/><br/>Remember that Last Word has a very long cast range, and thus can be targeted on fleeing enemy heroes. If you manage to cast it on an enemy who is already very low on health, you can secure the kill as he will most likely die to the damage at the end of the delay, proccing Intelligence Steal at the same time.<br/><br/>Last Word can be highly effective against heroes with two-spell combos or single spells with two parts, as they are only able to cast the first part of their combo but not the second due to the silence. This is particularly effective against combos such as Tiny's Avalanche-Toss, Keeper of the Light's Illuminate, Elder Titan's Astral Spirit into Echo Stomp, Phoenix' Icarus Dive, and so on.<br/><h4>Global Silence</h4>Global Silence is a powerful initiating and counter-initiating spell that can be cast no matter where Silencer is. However, keep in mind the spell's long cooldown, as using it ineffectively gives the enemy a window of opportunity where they can engage your team in the knowledge that you do not have your ultimate.<br/><br/>Global Silence can apply its debuff through spell immunity and invulnerability. This means that it is able to silence enemies even after they activate a Black King Bar, and even through spells like Ball Lightning. However, it is also a purgeable debuff, meaning that activating Black King Bar or Manta Style after being afflicted with Global Silence removes it. As such, it is important to time your use of the ultimate wisely.<br/><br/>Silencer on his own is not an initiator; if you try to initiate with Global Silence alone, the enemy team can simply disengage and wait out the silence. However, Global Silence can synergize extremely well with almost any initiator. When someone on your team initiates (or immediately before), activate Global Silence. The other team will be helpless as you collapse on them.<br/><br/>Silencer's spells can combo in many useful ways.<br/><br/>Last Word can be applied to an enemy during Global Silence, ensuring the silence at the end of the delay. This can extend the duration of silence on a single enemy.<br/><br/>Global Silence is usually used in team fights, at times where the enemy usually wants to cast spells. Applying Arcane Curse on enemies in such situations can greatly increase the damage they take, or prevent them from casting spells even further. Arcane Curse's effect even stacks with itself, so when having Global Silence upgraded, placing 2 curses on enemies can have devastating outcomes.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>One each of Tango and Healing Salve are minimum regen requirements to stay in lane without being harassed out. As a support, Silencer can also share the benefits of this regen with his carry.<br/><br/>As he is reliant on casting spells, Clarity is very important for allowing Silencer to harass enemies with Arcane Curse or cast his other spells as needed.<br/><br/>Choice of early stat items varies depending on Silencer's role. If playing as a carry, Circlet and Mantle of Intelligence give him the most benefit for the inventory space, but if played as a support cheaper items should be substituted as Silencer must spend his starting gold on support items instead.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are mandatory on all heroes. In Silencer's case, being able to get close enough to cast his spells is important, as he can potentially get kills or assists to proc Intelligence Steal.<br/><br/>Wind Lace is useful if playing support for a small move speed boost if starting gold is spent on support items. Additionally, it can be further built into Eul's Scepter of Divinity.<br/><br/>Magic Wand has all the benefits of Magic Stick, along with providing stats and greater charge storage. As Silencer is quite vulnerable to enemy attacks even as a carry, burst HP regen is always helpful.<br/><br/>Null Talisman is a cheap stat item that provides good attributes for the gold spent on it. Increasing his intelligence is important for giving him base damage, increasing the size of his mana pool, and gaining more bonus damage from Glaives of Wisdom.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads are important for providing Silencer with stats, particularly strength to give him more HP, no matter if he's a carry or support. The ability to switch attributes can help with spell casting or damage output, and the attack speed is highly beneficial when playing as a carry.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence is a powerful item to build on a carry Silencer. The intelligence gives him a bigger mana pool and increases the effectiveness of Glaives of Wisdom, the attack speed and damage give him more physical damage output, and the mana regen allows him to ignore the mana cost of Glaives of Wisdom. Soul Burn is especially powerful as Silencer lacks a directly targeted silence in his spells, and it can be used in conjunction with his other abilities, both to allow Arcane Curse to last for its full duration and to extend the silence portion of Last Word up to 11 seconds.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a very good support item that gives Silencer the ability to contribute more in teamfights, as it gives him stats and armor alongside the heal. While a carry Silencer often needs to build more powerful items instead, Mekansm is beneficial for a carry Silencer as well.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is a mandatory requirement on all heroes. As Silencer benefits greatly from showing up to teamfights due to his disables and Intelligence Steal, at least one should be carried at all times.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Scythe of Vyse provides a strong disable, and helps with Silencer's lack of hard disables. The stats it provides are very beneficial, giving him more intelligence and HP as well as powerful mana regen to sustain his spells. It is a good item to build whether as a support or carry.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is an inexpensive utility item that provides both Intelligence and HP, and is great for Silencer if he needs early survivability. The slow is also great for catching enemies out of position, or holding them in place so that you can cut them down with Glaives of Wisdom.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard greatly increases Silencer's survivability against physical damage while also granting him more intelligence to fuel his spells and attacks, making it a powerful carry item. The slow can also be used to chase down fleeing enemies more easily.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a very powerful utility item, particularly on a support Silencer. The increased movement speed and mana regen allows Silencer to be more active on the map, while Cyclone can disable enemies, remove debuffs from yourself and make yourself temporarily invulnerable.<br/><br/>Black King Bar greatly increases Silencer's survivability, particularly as a carry. It gives him more HP and right-click damage, and the spell immunity prevents him from being disabled before he can cast his spells to disable the enemy instead.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter adds Arcane Curse to Global Silence, adding a slow effect to every enemy for the duration and damage when it ends. This Curse fully stacks with the castable Arcane Curse, and stacks with itself should you also have a Refresher Orb. The item itself also grants Silencer many beneficial stats across the board, giving him more survivability overall.<br/><br/>When played as a support, Silencer should carry at least some of the support duties. This means assisting the team's other supports in purchasing the Animal Courier, starting Observer Ward, upgrading to the Flying Courier, and so on.<br/><br/>Bottle can be beneficial on Silencer if he is played as a mid carry, as his harass spells do not cost large amounts of mana. The health regen also allows him to stay longer in lane.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a powerful mobility tool, no matter what role Silencer is played in. As a support he can easily position himself to cast his disables on the enemy, as well as use it to evade enemy ganks. As a carry, it gives him strong positioning, allowing him to move quickly into a fight to attack after disabling the enemy with his ultimate. Or to simply blink in to steal intelligence from dying enemy Heroes.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is highly beneficial on a support Silencer, who does not rely on his right-clicks in order to be effective. Becoming immune to physical damage allows Silencer to get his spells off more easily, and buys him time if the enemy's carry jumps on him. This can be upgraded to Ethereal Blade which gives him agility for more attack speed and armor, and if Silencer has stolen a substantial amount of intelligence, Silencer can easily nuke down weakened or low-leveled Heroes with its active Ether Blast. And if Ether Blast is used in tandem with a Dagon Silencer further increases his killing power, provided he has stolen plenty of intelligence.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is a powerful survivability item that can either be used for utility on a support Silencer or more staying power as a carry Silencer. The extra HP and evasion give Silencer more survivability against physical damage, and the active can be used to disarm a target on top of silences, rendering enemies completely unable to do anything.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade is an unorthodox item to build on Silencer but serves him extremely well as a carry. The agility gives him much more attack speed and some armor, and the intelligence firms up his mana pool and increases Glaives of Wisdom's effectiveness. However, the main utility is that the mana burn stacks with Glaives of Wisdom, allowing Silencer to deal large amounts of Pure damage and destroy the enemy's mana with each attack, creating powerful synergy all the silences Silencer has, so that he can burn their mana with attacks, before they can spend it. The active ability is also very useful in removing buffs from enemies while holding them in place to eviscerate them with your right-clicks.<br/><br/>Force Staff is important on Silencer whether he is played as a carry or support. As a support, it provides mobility that helps mitigate his frailty and allows him to close the distance quickly to cast spells, while also giving him HP regen and some intelligence to give him more mana. As a carry, it also increases the effectiveness of Glaives of Wisdom.<br/>Also, it allows a nice build up to Hurricane Pike, providing both increased attack range offensively and defensively. The shorter cooldown can be combined with Rod of Atos to allow extremely reliable escapes.<br/><br/><br/>Mjollnir is a situational weapon to build on a carry Silencer. While it is a Unique Attack Modifier, it does not completely override Glaives of Wisdom, only when it procs, allowing Silencer to continue to deal Pure damage with his attacks while throwing chained magical damage into the mix. The vastly increased attack speed allows Silencer to output a lot of damage with his physical attacks, and the shield can be used on himself to deal out even more physical damage or on a highly durable ally who can tank on the front lines.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb can be a powerful utility item to purchase on a support Silencer if the enemy is mostly reliant on their usage of spells in a fight. The ability to inflict up to 12 seconds of silence to the enemy in a teamfight, through spell immunity and invulnerability, can prevent them from retaliating effectively against your team, securing a victory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Skywrath Mage is a very strong nuker whose spells allow him to deal tremendous amounts of magic damage to enemy heroes. If left uninterrupted, he is a force to be reckoned with and is capable of destroying enemy heroes by himself.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>High burst damage from spells<br/><br/>Long cast range<br/><br/>High mana pool<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very fragile<br/><br/>Low armor<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Beware that Skywrath Mage's extremely low strength and agility gives him very little HP and armor, resulting in severe vulnerability against physical damage. The combination of low HP and high nuke damage also renders him vulnerable to reflected damage, meaning that enemies who buy a Blade Mail can cause him to connive in his own destruction if they have more HP than him.<br/><br/>Due to the long cast range on his spells, Skywrath is capable of casting his spells on enemies safely from behind his allies, in order to mitigate his frailty. As such, positioning is very important as inadvertently getting too close to the enemy can result in his demise. His high base movement speed and near-instant cast animations allow him to take advantage of his long range, however his moves must be planned and calculated as his slow turn rate counteracts this.<br/><br/>Skywrath Mage has the third-highest intelligence growth in the game, which means that his mana pool is often large enough to accommodate all of his spells. However, beware that this can be turned against you depending on the enemies you are facing, as certain abilities are particularly effective against Skywrath Mage, such as Nether Ward, Mana Void and Mana Burn. Plan for counters against such situations if needed, and be prepared to purchase items to shield yourself from such abilities.<br/><br/>Due to the potency of his nukes, Skywrath Mage is capable of being played in a number of ways.<br/><br/>In the most general case, Skywrath Mage is a potent safe-lane support. He can spam Arcane Bolt to harass the enemy off-laner away while dealing respectable amounts of damage, and can slow them from range and silence them during kill attempts. As a casting support, he is capable of dealing large amounts of damage relying only on his spells, meaning that he can be effective with just levels.<br/><br/>Due to his strong nuking power, Skywrath Mage can be a very potent mid-laner. His ability to wear down his lane opponent from range, as well as disable and burst them down with his spells, can make him a powerful threat in almost any match-up. With good gold and experience gain, Skywrath Mage's spells can become a force to be reckoned with, allowing him to burst down and kill enemy heroes with relative ease.<br/><br/>Skywrath Mage's combination of high movement speed and powerful nuking ability make him a strong roamer and ganker. Possession of a long-range slow in Concussive Shot and a silence in Ancient Seal allow him to apply disables to enemies and burst them down with his spells, especially if combined with a partner with disables. As he requires experience and gold to avoid falling off in the late game, getting early kills can help him to remain a powerful threat throughout a match.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arcane Bolt</h4>Arcane Bolt is a low-cost spammable targeted nuke that scales with Skywrath Mage's intelligence.<br/><br/>Arcane Bolt is a very strong harassment spell that also serves as a substitute for physical attacks with enough intelligence. It can become a very powerful and spammable magic nuke past the laning stage as it grows stronger alongside Skywrath Mage.<br/><br/>In the laning stage, Skywrath Mage can use Arcane Bolt to easily harass his lane opponent out of the lane, as its low mana cost and low cooldown allow him to use it extremely frequently. As it is a single-target spell, it does not draw aggro, so it can be cast without fear of inadvertently pushing the lane. However, beware that consistent use of Arcane Bolt will quickly build up charges for enemies' Magic Sticks, so balance your use of the spell accordingly.<br/><br/>The scaling nature of Arcane Bolt makes it a strong magic nuke at all stages of the game, as it is one of very few magic nukes that gains power alongside Skywrath Mage. Building powerful intelligence items boosts Skywrath's base damage, the size of his mana pool, and the amount of damage that Arcane Bolt deals, making him a strong threat the more farm he has. The scaling nature and low cooldown of the spell, 2 seconds at level 4, allows Skywrath Mage to use Arcane Bolt as an augmentation for his right-clicks, nuking down single targets very quickly as long as he has enough mana regen to keep up. This allows Skywrath to push creep waves or farm most neutral camps very quickly, giving him levels and gold.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, prolonged use of Arcane Bolt can drain your mana pool alarmingly quickly, even if you have already purchased many intelligence items. Mana regen is a necessity if you want to be able to cast your other spells when they are needed.<br/><br/>Unlike most other targeted abilities, Arcane Bolt cannot be disjointed, and will continue to follow its target and eventually damage them even if they blink away or turn invisible. You can use this to hunt down evasive targets, as the projectile provides flying vision as it homes in on its target.<br/><h4>Concussive Shot</h4>Concussive Shot automatically launches a magical projectile that homes in on the closest enemy hero, damaging and slowing them.<br/><br/>Its long cast range allows Skywrath Mage to use Concussive Shot to slow an enemy from a great distance away. As it also homes in on the closest available target and has an instant cast time, the spell can be used as an initiating spell to slow a target at the start of an engagement, a finisher to catch a fleeing enemy who has escaped beyond the range of your other spells, or as an escape by slowing the closest pursuer without breaking stride.<br/><br/>If enemies are clumped up due to being affected by an ally's crowd-control spell (such as Vacuum, Berserker's Call or Reverse Polarity), casting Concussive shot into the group can allow you to damage and slow multiple enemy heroes with a single cast.<br/><br/>Concussive Shot will not target illusions, making it a powerful hero detection tool. If you are facing an illusion-based hero such as Phantom Lancer, Chaos Knight or Terrorblade, using Concussive Shot will cause it to automatically home in on the real hero, provided that they are the closest target for the spell. If the spell fizzles, then it means that the hero is not present. This can also be used to counter Manta Style by pinpointing the real hero among the illusions.<br/><h4>Ancient Seal</h4>Ancient Seal is a long-ranged targeted silence ability that reduces the magic resistance of its target.<br/><br/>Ancient Seal's magic resistance reduction is one of the strongest in the game, beaten only by Pugna's Decrepify. It allows Skywrath Mage to continue to deal tremendous amounts of magical damage even in the late game when enemies' health pools get large enough to shrug off most other magic nukes.<br/><br/>Ancient Seal is a strong ability for countering enemy mages who rely on casting their spells to be effective in teamfights. Its long cast range allows Skywrath to silence them from relative safety, and increase the damage they take from Skywrath's spells in order to permanently remove them from the field.<br/><br/>In the early game, it is recommended to take at least one value point in Ancient Seal, as a 3-second silence can prevent gank targets from casting their escape spells or counter-disabling, on top of greatly increasing their vulnerability to allies' initiating magic nukes as well as those of Skywrath himself. A 30% magic resistance reduction is enough to almost completely negate most heroes' base magic resistance, allowing them to take almost full damage from allied magic nukes.<br/><h4>Mystic Flare</h4>Mystic Flare bombards the target area with numerous waves of magic damage, dealing a large amount of damage that is split evenly amongst all enemy heroes in the area.<br/><br/>Mystic Flare consumes a significant fraction of Skywrath Mage's mana pool, but is one of the most devastating magic nukes in the game and has a very short cooldown for the amount of damage it deals. Properly used, it can allow Skywrath to kill almost any hero in the game when combined with his other spells.<br/><br/>Mystic Flare's damage is unreliable, as it only deals damage so long as the enemy is within its small radius, which can be escaped as Skywrath does not have any disables that can completely immobilize a target, nor can he build any items that provide one. In general, it is best to set up your ultimate by casting Concussive Shot to slow the target first, and then add another slow or disable if possible (such as Rod of Atos or Scythe of Vyse) to reduce their mobility further. The best course of action is to let a teammate disable the target through a root, taunt or stun, so that they are unable to move at all for the duration of the ultimate.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Ancient Seal not only increases the damage that the target will take, but can prevent them from casting any escape spells that allow them to displace themselves outside of the field. If a stun is not available, then casting Ancient Seal on top of Concussive Shot can help to pin the target down.<br/><br/>Remember that Mystic Flare distributes its damage evenly among all heroes in the field, but ignores illusions. As such, it is strong against illusion heroes (on top of Concussive Shot allowing you to reveal the true hero among the illusions), but also allows its damage to be more than halved by another enemy player or two stepping into the field to split the damage. This makes Mystic Flare unusual for an area-of-effect spell as it is strong for killing lone targets but is weak against groups of enemies.<br/><br/>One of Mystic Flare's greatest weaknesses is that Force Staff can be used on its target in order to almost immediately push them to safety. This makes Scythe of Vyse ever more invaluable as a disable tool and emphasizes the spell's single-target nature, as using the spell on an enemy who does not have any nearby allies prevents them from being Forced to safety, and Hex prevents the target from using items as well as spells, preventing them from using their own Force Staff on themselves.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Healing Salve and Tango are basic regen items that should be purchased no matter what lane Skywrath Mage is placed in. They can also be used to sustain lane mates who are constantly getting harassed by the enemy.<br/><br/>Three Clarity ensure that you do not run out of mana while laning. Due to how spammable Arcane Bolt is, having the mana to use it consistently can allow you to harass and zone out your lane opponents.<br/><br/>Three Iron Branches give a helpful boost to all your attributes for a cheap price, and later build into a Magic Wand should you need one.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Arcane Boots should be purchased as quickly as possible, as they expand the size of Skywrath's mana pool and allow him to replenish a portion of it occasionally (as well as that of his allies).<br/><br/>Magic Stick can instantly restore some of Skywrath's health and mana. The health replenishment is crucial given his very small health pool, while the mana replenishment can allow him to cast one or two more spells in an emergency.<br/><br/>Null Talisman provides an assortment of stats, most important among them intelligence, giving Skywrath Mage more mana, more damage, and increasing the strength of Arcane Bolt.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand grants all the same benefits of Magic Stick, along with attributes and larger charge storage. If Skywrath is given low farm priority, building one of these is cheap and effective.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos boosts Skywrath Mage's health and intelligence, both of which are extremely important. Its active ability can root a target from a very long distance away, allowing him to keep a single target in place for Mystic Flare<br/><br/>Void Stone is a very strong intermediary item to get on Skywrath. The scaling mana regen allows him to maintain his mana pool at all points of the game, and can build into many useful situational items.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important on all heroes. Because Skywrath Mage possesses such strong nuking power, being able to appear at any fight can greatly increase the odds of his team getting at least one or two kills against the enemy.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Ethereal Blade, while expensive, serves dual purposes for Skywrath Mage. Used offensively, the active ability can inflict tremendous nuke damage to an enemy due to Skywrath's high intelligence gain and weaken their magic resistance, stacking with Ancient Seal to increase the target's vulnerability to his nukes. Used defensively, it can provide Skywrath with immunity to physical damage for a short time, though it can be left as a Ghost Scepter if farm is an issue.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a strong utility item on any support, and synergizes with Skywrath Mage's needs. It provides him with instant mobility, allowing him to re-position to cast his spells against the enemy, or to aid in escaping from enemies; it can be used to this end on allies as well. The item's bonus intelligence gives Skywrath more mana, base damage and strengthens Arcane Bolt, and the health regen keeps his meager health pool topped up.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a powerful item in that it allows Skywrath Mage to zone out enemies for a significant amount of time with Mystic Flare. When used in choke points like small ramps or between trees, enemies have to either stay back, allowing Skywrath Mage to escape, or cage an enemy in, or go through and take heavy damage and risk their lives. It is also very strong when combined with long disables like Chronosphere, Sacred Arrow or Adaptive Strike, capable of mowing down even the tankiest targets.<br/><br/>Bloodstone is a very powerful item on Skywrath Mage, and can be built up by disassembling your Arcane Boots. It grants him a greatly increased health and mana pool and powerful mana regen, increasing his staying power in fights and keeping up with the mana cost of his spells.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a good utility item that is also cheap and easy to build. It provides Skywrath with more intelligence and scaling mana regen, and the increased movement speed allows him to chase and flee much more effectively, compounding his already impressive base movement speed. The active can be used as an interrupting disable, something that Skywrath Mage otherwise lacks, or can be used to give himself temporary invulnerability (such as to prevent himself from being damaged by an enemy Blade Mail) while also purging debuffs from himself (such as silences).<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Skywrath Mage a large amount of intelligence as well as powerful survivability against physical damage. The aura can help him to contribute more in teamfights, and the armor can help keep him alive for longer as his agility gain is among the worst in the game.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a cheap purchase that grants Skywrath Mage with strong benefits, particularly boosting his intelligence and giving him armor and health regen. The active can weaken enemies' magic resistance on top of Ancient Seal and make them more vulnerable to his magic nukes, as well as those of his allies, making it a powerful utility item that can be built up from an already-purchased Null Talisman.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a costly item, but one which is very strong on any support hero. The great amount of intelligence and attributes greatly benefits Skywrath Mage, and the scaling mana regen allows him to sustain his mana pool. Most importantly, the active is a very strong hard-disable that can set up kills for his spells, or for allies to focus the target down.<br/><br/>Dagon synergizes with Skywrath Mage's ability to nuke down targets by giving him even more magic damage and increasing his intelligence.<br/><br/>Octarine Core allows Skywrath Mage to take advantage of his tremendous nuking power and spammable spells. The item gives him more intelligence, as well as mana and health, increasing his battlefield presence. The cooldown reduction and spell lifesteal allow him to use Arcane Bolt much more frequently and increase his survivability by replenishing his health as he deals damage to the enemy with his spells.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are an unorthodox purchase on Skywrath Mage, as he needs mana regen and a bigger mana pool in order to be effective. However, Tranquil Boots can increase his survivability, as the bonus armor can greatly increase his survivability against physical damage since the hero himself will have barely any armor at all. The passive HP regen aids in keeping him on the field as much of his true damage comes from Arcane Bolt rather than his right-clicks, and the increased movement speed boosts his ability to roam and gank.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can be a dangerous purchase on Skywrath Mage as it can heavily tax his already-low HP pool, however, it also provides passive HP regen, a small amount of scaling mana regen, and gives him on-demand mana for casting his spells, reducing the strain his spells put on his mana pool. As well, Soul Ring builds into a Bloodstone, which can be a useful item to have on Skywrath.<br/><br/>Aether Lens can be easily obtained through disassembling Arcane Boots. Besides providing extra HP regen, boosting the cast range on Skywrath Mage's spells allows him to bombard the enemy from even farther away, extending his safety radius. The spell damage amp greatly boosts his nuking power, particularly as it stacks alongside Ancient Seal.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger greatly increases Skywrath Mage's ability to position himself for casting his spells, allowing him to extend the range of his already long-reaching spells. It can allow him to get the drop on enemies and nuke them down with very little warning, or escape from pursuing enemies provided that he can activate it before taking player damage.<br/><br/>Black King Bar does not synergize well with Skywrath Mage's ability to nuke down his foes, however, it does provide spell immunity, allowing him to function in teamfights without worry of being interrupted or disabled. As well, the extra strength gives him some more survivability by giving him more HP.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is an expensive investment, but can drastically boost Skywrath Mage's mobility if purchased as an early-game item. Having constant access to teleportation allows Skywrath to return to base after depleting his mana pool on ganks, or re-position globally to show up to teamfights or ganks. As well, the increased movement speed allows him to ruthlessly chase down foes and blast them down with his spells.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Storm Spirit Storm Spirit is a very mobile ganker who thrives on an aggressive play style. While he is very mana-hungry and difficult to master, he more than makes up for this by rewarding players with aggressive mindsets and good dexterity, who can use his abilities to jump on foes from extremely long distances, pummel them down with tremendous amounts of magical damage, and escape before their allies can turn on him.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Incredibly mobile.<br/><br/>High snowball potential.<br/><br/>Low cooldowns on all of his skills.<br/><br/>Can reliably solo-kill most fragile heroes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Can run out of mana very quickly without proper management.<br/><br/>Very vulnerable in the early game.<br/><br/>Very farm dependent.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>In order to make the most of his mobility, Storm Spirit's first priority should be to build items that give him both mana and mana regen. Ball Lightning allows him to initiate and escape at will, making him very hard to catch in the hands of a skilled player, however it consumes large amounts of his mana pool, meaning that life or death literally rests on how much mana Storm Spirit can muster up when needed.<br/><br/>Storm Spirit is most generally played in the mid lane, as his abilities make him an extremely powerful hero to have early levels and gold on. While he is quite weak and vulnerable before he hits level 6, he becomes a force to be reckoned with once he obtains access to his ultimate.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Static Remnant</h4>Static Remnant drops a remnant on Storm Spirit's position upon cast, detonating when an enemy walks into its trigger radius or when it expires.<br/><br/>In the laning stage, Static Remnant can be used to apply nuke damage to a creep wave, useful for getting multiple last-hits at once or pushing the lane in order to buy yourself space to check the runes. However, it is also dangerous since the spell's small radius means that Storm Spirit, a ranged hero with low HP, must walk into melee range of the creep wave in order to make the most of it. Make sure that the enemy cannot easily capitalize on this disadvantageous positioning before doing this.<br/><br/>If your laning opponent is a melee hero, Static Remnant would be very effective to prevent them from lasthitting. Cast Remnant when the hero comes close to the creep wave to apply the damage, also with attack and Overload proc.<br/><br/>Due to its area-of-effect nature and low mana cost and cooldown, Static Remnant can be a useful spell for farming neutral camps, especially if they have been stacked. Each remnant can deal its damage to the entire camp if placed close enough, reducing the amount of time required to farm them.<br/><br/>Mind the delay between placement and materialization of a Static Remnant. Smart enemies can run outside of its radius in the second after placing the remnant, so try to make sure that the enemy is otherwise disabled in order to land the explosion on them. Position yourself using Ball Lightning and cast Static Remnant on their escape route to inflict more damage or for enemies to change their path.<br/><br/>Static Remnant has an instant cast time, allowing Storm Spirit to place them without breaking stride. When running from enemies, leaving a Static Remnant in your wake can discourage enemies from pursuing in the early game if they cannot afford to take the damage.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, a Static Remnant will still explode if an invisible enemy enters its radius. If a Static Remnant explodes without a visible enemy entering its radius, but before its expiration time, it means that an invisible enemy is approaching.<br/><br/>Static Remnant gives flying vision for its duration, which allows it to be used to gain vision through the fog of war. This can be used to check inside Roshan's pit, or to see over trees and high ground. It can be particularly useful when placed behind a tree, as enemies will be unable to see the remnant but it will still provide vision of them until it explodes.<br/><h4>Electric Vortex</h4>Electric Vortex is a short disable that stuns its target as it is pulled in.<br/><br/>As a general rule of thumb, Electric Vortex has little value at level 1, and is only useful for catching enemies at level 3 or higher, so it should either have multiple early skill points put into it in order to increase Storm Spirit's disable potential, or altogether ignored in the early game for more damage output through his other spells.<br/><br/>Still, putting a single point is okay to proc Overload one more time in short period, hinder enemy's movement to get more chance to attack, also interrupt Town Portal Scrolls.<br/><br/>At any level, Electric Vortex can pull an enemy into the explosion radius of Static Remnant, provided that it was already placed at the same location that Storm Spirit casts Electric Vortex from. However, keep in mind that Static Remnant takes time to materialize, and at level 1 Electric Vortex only pulls for just barely the theoretical amount of time and distance needed for this; in practical terms, a fleeing enemy and the delay between commands means that they will likely run outside of the remnant before it materializes unless Electric Vortex is cast on a target inside of its maximum range. Regardless, it is wise to put at least two levels into Electric Vortex in order to ensure that enemies will be caught by a Static Remnant.<br/><br/>Beware that Electric Vortex will also halve Storm Spirit's movement speed upon casting, meaning that he is unable to easily move himself to a more advantageous position to attack or cast his other spells. As such, the only ways to reliably re-position are either to have activated a Haste rune or to cast Ball Lightning.<br/><h4>Overload</h4>Overload is the linchpin that links together all of Storm Spirit's abilities and augments the amount of damage that his physical attacks deal.<br/><br/>Overload procs every time Storm Spirit casts any of his spells. As such, mastery of Storm Spirit requires that players learn to attack targets between every spell in order to maximize the amount of damage dealt.<br/><br/>The area-of-effect nature of Overload allows for it to be used as a farming spell. Throwing an Overload charge at the center of a group of creeps will apply the damage and slow to all of them, which allows Storm Spirit to deal aftershock damage to groups of creeps after using a spell.<br/><br/>The damage from Overload also allows it to be used as a harassing spell in the laning stage, especially in the mid lane due to easier access to runes to replenish mana using bottle. Hitting enemy player with attack together with Overload damage is the main way to harass a ranged hero since most of them won't trigger Static Remnant often. However, the attack range of Storm Spirit is relatively short - 480 compared to Queen of Pain's 550 or Lina's 670. Laning with an experienced player of these heroes would be dreadful. Use the damage of Overload to lasthit to counteract heroes with either long attack range or high attack damage, such as Shadow Fiend and Viper, to gain gold and experience instead of harassing.<br/><br/>If the enemy is standing close to a creep (such as the ranged creep), attacking that creep with the Overload charge can deal splash damage to the enemy player without drawing aggro.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, attacks will check for Overload procs when they successfully connect. As such, it is possible to throw an attack, and then cast a spell while the projectile is mid-air, and the projectile will still proc Overload on its target. This can be used to get kills on low-health enemies who are fleeing, but who will escape before a spell comes off cooldown for proccing Overload prior to attacking; attacking and then casting a spell to proc Overload will cause the subsequent attack to deal its damage and slow.<br/><br/>Beware that attacking spell immune units, particularly ancients and wards, will still proc Overload even if it will not deal the damage or slow on that unit. In the early game when Storm Spirit's mana is still finite, this can result in a wasted Overload proc, so be careful about which targets to attack in order to maximize the usage of Storm Spirit's mana.<br/><h4>Ball Lightning</h4>Ball Lightning makes Storm Spirit one of the most mobile and deadly heroes in the game, as it gives him strong initiation and escape potential. However, it is also one of the most mana-costly spells in the game, so good mana management is key to playing Storm Spirit well.<br/><br/>Because Ball Lightning's mana cost is expressed as a percentage of Storm Spirit's total mana pool, it is crucial to build mana regen items on him, since the mana cost of the spell increases in tandem with the size of his mana pool. By focusing on mana regen, Storm Spirit can quickly replenish the mana used by his ultimate between engagements, allowing him to be ready for another one shortly after.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Ball Lightning does have a flat mana cost for each activation as well as per distance traveled. The larger Storm Spirit's mana pool is, the more negligible this flat cost becomes. As well, a larger mana pool also reduces the cost of his other spells relative to how much mana he has, allowing for more profligate use of Static Remnant.<br/><br/>Storm Spirit is invulnerable during Ball Lightning, so he cannot be damaged, disabled or otherwise affected by most spells in the game. As such, it can be cast to disjoint incoming projectiles or to avoid other types of damage and disables if timed properly.<br/><br/>As Ball Lightning has no cooldown, it can be used to travel over short distances to proc Overload. This can be a powerful, albeit costly way to add more damage to Storm Spirit's attacks during ganks.<br/><br/>Items can still be used, and Storm Spirit can still attack during Ball Lightning. During initiations, this means that enemies can be disabled prior to arrival with items like Orchid Malevolence and Scythe of Vyse, an Overload attack can be made before emerging, and Shiva's Guard can be activated to expand its radius to encompass multiple enemies. This also means that during escapes, Town Portal Scroll can be channeled during the jump, allowing Storm Spirit to put distance between himself and any pursuing enemies while channeling.<br/><br/>When using Ball Lightning to initiate or escape, it is sometimes wise to only jump the minimum distance necessary, due to the spell's high mana cost. Making unnecessarily long jumps will drain Storm Spirit's mana quickly, allowing for less mana to be used for attacks and disables upon reaching a gank target, or allowing for less mana for making a secondary escape jump if needed.<br/><br/>Never discount the damage that Ball Lightning itself deals if it connects with a target, especially when upgraded to Level 3. When initiating over longer distances, it can put a respectable amount of damage on the table, increasing the odds of a successful kill. However, doing so effectively requires Storm Spirit to land right on top of, or pass right over the enemy, which requires additional skill since the target's path must be predicted right when the jump is made.<br/><br/>The massive initiation potential of Ball Lightning means that Storm Spirit can engage foes who are behind their teammates, focusing down squishy supports with low HP at the beginning of fights. This can be useful for removing them from the picture before they can cast any of their powerful teamfight spells, or use any crucial items such as Mekansm or Pipe of Insight.<br/><br/>Initiating on and killing enemies requires good mechanical skills and planning in order to make the most of all of Storm Spirit's spells. The textbook initiation is: Ball Lightning to close the distance > Cast disable while en route ( Orchid Malevolence) > Overload attack (if no quick counteract items such as Manta Style or Black King Bar in terms of Orchid Malevolence) > Electric Vortex > Overload attack > Static Remnant > Overload attack > Ball Lightning over short distance > Overload attack > Repeat as needed using either Static Remnant or Ball Lightning > Escape with Ball Lightning if necessary. With Scythe of Vyse more actions could be applied before casting Electric Vortex.<br/><br/>You can cast Ball Lightning during Ball Lightning, but if you reach its cast point and you're still traveling, it fails casting. When you travel to a bad location and you still have enough mana, you can cast Ball Lightning to the right direction at about 375~522.5/562.5~783.75/750~1045 (0.3*1250/1875/2500, and because of turn rate) distance to destination. If you succeed, you would turn to right direction right after you land without any trails.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are generally recommended basic regen items in most situations.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Storm Spirit to replenish his mana in the laning stage. It can be useful for allowing Storm Spirit to use Static Remnant one or two more times.<br/><br/>Mantle of Intelligence and Circlet provide good stats, especially to intelligence for increased base damage. In particular, the two items build towards a Null Talisman, which give Storm Spirit a number of useful bonuses.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick can give Storm Spirit a quick burst of mana and health when needed. This can help give Storm the extra bit he needs to survive and escape a gank, or enough to cast one more spell to finish off a foe.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are important on all heroes as early as possible. For Storm Spirit, the ability to out-maneuver his lane opponent is crucial to victory.<br/><br/>Null Talisman gives Storm Spirit a good balance of stats, most importantly intelligence and damage for more mana and last-hitting power. Depending on the situation, two Null Talismans can be useful for giving Storm good early stats.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand is a cheap upgrade from Magic Stick which provides very cost effective attributes, as well as additional burst HP and mana regen.<br/><br/>Power Treads give Storm Spirit the ability to treads switch, crucial when combined with a Bottle. As well, the increased attack speed increases his ability to put damage on his opponents (particularly Overload), while the attribute bonus can be shifted between strength for more survivability or intelligence for more mana and attack damage.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence is extremely strong on Storm Spirit, as it greatly magnifies his offensive potential. The intelligence and mana regen bonus allow him to remain relatively autonomous when roaming the battlefield, giving him the mana to engage on enemies. The damage and attack speed bonuses, combined with the intelligence bonus, increase Storm's right-click power, allowing him to use his physical attacks to greater effect. Most importantly, the active allows Storm Spirit to silence enemies that he initiates on with Ball Lightning, magnifying the amount of damage he deals due to the damage amplification, as well as preventing targets from simply using their escape spells.<br/>Later you can upgrade your Malevolence into a Bloodthorn.<br/><br/><br/>Bottle is crucial to obtain early when playing in the mid lane. Bottling runes allows Storm Spirit to maintain his HP and mana against his lane opponent, and the runes themselves can be put to use at a time of the player's choosing, making it an extremely potent item at all stages of the game.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is crucial on all heroes. For Storm Spirit, the ability to teleport to a teammate's aid or show up to a teamfight will allow him to take utmost advantage of his already strong mobility.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very strong item to purchase on any intelligence hero, and is good on Storm Spirit for all the same reasons as Orchid Malevolence. The item grants a strong intelligence and mana regeneration boost, making Storm extremely mana-independent, and the bonus strength and agility shore up his weaknesses in those areas as well. The active ability allows Storm Spirit to instantly disable an enemy during an initiation, and more than double up on the time that the enemy is hard-disabled when combined with Electric Vortex.<br/><br/>Bloodstone gives Storm Spirit many strong benefits, allowing him to become a force to be reckoned with by any foe. The large HP and mana bonuses make Storm Spirit much more survivable and allow him to cast his spells more profligately, and the bonus mana regen (both the percentage-based regen and the flat regen from the charges) give him an almost infinite mana pool, allowing him to be active on the map for extended periods of time. If it can be built early and multiple charges obtained, Storm Spirit can quickly snowball out of control and dominate the battlefield.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere gives Storm Spirit stats across the board and increased mana regen, as well as a very strong survivability passive. Spellblock can block targeted disables, making him much harder to catch out of position, making him an extremely slippery foe.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is useful when the enemy team has numerous disables that they can use to catch and kill Storm Spirit. The spell immunity can be used during a fight to focus down enemies without fear of being stunned or silenced.<br/><br/>Dagon can be a situationally strong item if Storm Spirit needs more single-target killing power and already has a strong advantage over the enemy team. The item itself provides more intelligence, and the active can put more damage on an enemy in order to accelerate the amount of time required to kill them.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Intelligence, armor, and a giant slow that is useful for teamfights. It can be a strong item if Storm Spirit needs survivability against physical damage instead of against disables.<br/><br/>Octarine Core can be a good item to purchase on Storm Spirit. The bonuses it grants are powerful on any intelligence hero, and the spell lifesteal can allow Storm to maintain his HP pool by using his spells, making him harder to bring down in fights if the enemy is able to damage him. More importantly though, the cooldown reduction can greatly improve Storm's turnaround time, as his spells and items become ready for use faster; in particular, the reduced cooldown on Static Remnant can allow for greater damage output and more Overload procs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Techies is a very unorthodox hero in the game, as their team contribution comes mainly from placing traps outside of combat rather than engaging enemies in fights. Playing Techies requires good map awareness and game sense in order to know when and where to place traps.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Very high attack range.<br/><br/>Excellent base armor (7).<br/><br/>Not dependent on teamfights to be effective.<br/><br/>Very long root with Stasis Trap.<br/><br/>Can deny self with Blast Off!.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Very mana dependent in the early game.<br/><br/>Low starting health.<br/><br/>Lowest starting damage.<br/><br/>Easily countered by silence and summoned units.<br/><br/>Very low mobility.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Techies are also one of the few heroes able to truly mess with the enemy. Play mind games with them. Do not force yourself into any habits, while making sure you continually adapt to theirs.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Proximity Mines</h4>The Proximity Mines get revealed when there is an enemy within an 400 AOE and triggers if they stay in the AOE for 1.6 seconds.<br/><h4>As they become visible to the enemy when they are in range, you need to stack them like a Venn diagramm with a Stasis Trap covering the middle part, so if an unaware enemy walks into the Stasis radius, he gets rooted and all three mines should explode. By creating a lattice of Proximity Mines and Stasis Traps pairs, you can ensure that the enemy will get hit anyway if he force-staffs himself forward.</h4>It is highly recommended to max out this skill first, and spend most of the game laying Proximity Mines down across the map, preferably in unexpected places, where the enemy is likely to go when he runs away from a gank. As a rule of thumb, you should never have this spell off cooldown.<br/><h4>However, you should nt spend the entire game planting them outside of lanes. As a single level 3 proximity mine can clear out an entire creep wave they make the bread and butter of your Gold-per-Minute, and they also deal huge damage to towers, so you should spend a fair amount of time pushing lanes and taking towers quietly when the enemy team is busy somewhere else.</h4>Proximity Mines still trigger if an invisible enemy walks over them, letting you know when one of them is coming your way.<br/><h4>A great combo is to wait for the enemy to walk into a Stasis Trap stacked on top of a Proximity Mine, then Blast Off! on top of him and place another Proximity Mine right as the first one explodes, netting you 2200 Magical damage before damage amplification/reduction.</h4>Stasis Trap<br/><br/>[edit | edit source]<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting Items:</b><br/>Tango gives Techies health recovery in-lane, mitigating harassment damage.<br/><br/>Healing Salve allows for a quick way to regain your health after an early kill or escape attempt using Blast Off!.<br/><br/>Multiple stacks of Clarity provide Techies with the mana needed for early-game Proximity Mines and Stasis Trap.<br/><br/>Animal Courier is a necessary purchase for all teams at the start of a match.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is useful for planting mines in a lane or at rune spot before the enemy heroes have a chance of reaching them.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Null Talisman gives them mana, damage, and health. Combined with Soul Ring, they can be dropped to get more mana out of its active.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is your most important early-game purchase, as it allows Techies to continue planting mines over extended periods of time.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots fit Techies well in combination with a Soul Ring to compensate for their mines' mana cost, or to give mana to use Blast Off! without risking of dying/getting killed before they can deny themselves. Like Null Talisman, it can be dropped prior to using Soul Ring's active in order to restore more mana.<br/><br/>Wind Lace is an alternative to picking the +20 movement speed talent.<br/><br/>Infused Raindrop is good versus early harass and gives bonus mana regeneration.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is extremely important on Techies, as the hero has to be globally mobile in order to plant traps in unexpected areas. The heroes' strong defensive potential allows them to instantly fortify a tower's defenses, discouraging the enemy from pushing.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Force Staff gives Techies more mana and mobility, and can also be used to quickly displace themselves either to escape or to push enemies into your stasis traps (especially Gem carriers).<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity provides Techies with a bigger mana pool, scaling mana regen and more base movement speed, allowing the hero to be more mobile and plant mines more frequently. As well, the active ability can be used to disable an enemy (either to place a mine at their feet to deal nuke damage when they land, or deploy a Stasis Trap to stun them for a longer duration), or to provide temporary invulnerability and a self-dispel if the enemy jumps on them.<br/><br/>Octarine Core reduces the cooldown on all of Techies' abilities, allowing them to place traps more frequently. With Octarine Core, Techies can place up to 70 Remote Mines on the field, compared to the default 55. Together with the Level 25 Cooldown Reduction Talent they can have up to 90 mines and their Minefield Sign downtime gets reduced to 22.5 seconds. Techies cannot lifesteal with their mines, however they can lifesteal with Blast Off!, but since the damage to themselves is applied after the damage to the enemies, it will only have any noticeable effects when they are already missing some health. Their health will never be above 50% after using it. By using the +400 Blast Off! damage level 25 talent and landing Blast Off! on all 5 enemy heroes, they can completely negate any damage to themselves, if their health was below 50%. Keep that in mind when trying to deny yourself with Techies, if you are carrying an Octarine Core.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter drastically increases Techies' effectiveness across the board. Remote Mines become a much bigger threat due to their increased damage, and Techies can place them from farther away, allowing them to be used tactically in teamfights and allowing Techies to place traps more safely. Additionally, Minefield Sign becomes a usable ability, allowing Techies to use the sign to place guaranteed undetectable traps or to trick the enemy into avoiding an area that does not have mines.<br/><br/>Bloodstone gives Techies a great amount of health and mana, as well as tremendous regen, allowing them to place mines more frequently. The respawn timer reduction stacks with the one from your lvl 25 talent, and Pocket Deny can be used to deny yourself if you don't have time to do it with Blast Off!.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter is a great survival item, as it allows Techies to become temporarily invulnerable to physical damage when focused by the enemy. This can buy them more time to use Blast Off!, or to attempt to lead the enemy into mine traps.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Techies much needed Intelligence as well as armor. The aura and active can be used in teamfights to hinder the enemy, reducing their ability to spread out from your area-of-effect nukes.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a very powerful intelligence item, providing a lot of mana and a very strong disable that is useful in any situation. It allows Techies to provide additional lockdown in teamfights.<br/><br/>Necronomicon gives Techies additional pushing ability, provides more health and mana, and the True Sight from the level 3 Warrior can spot enemy Sentry Wards, allowing you to place traps with confidence.<br/><br/>Sentry Wards are a useful regular purchase on Techies, not only for de-warding enemy Observer Wards but also for destroying their Sentry Wards. Eliminating their Sentries from play can allow you to place traps in areas that they once considered safe, and forces the supports to buy more Sentry Wards, slowing their item progression considerably.<br/><br/>If you built one or two Null Talisman in the early game, you upgrade them midgame to a Veil of Discord to amplify your damage.<br/><br/>Bottle can be useful to purchase on a roaming Techies, as they often pass by runes on their way to set up traps. This allows them to replenish their mana and set traps over extended periods of time.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots are an alternative to Arcane Boots due to their low cost, passive health regen, increased armor and increased movement speed. Techies are the slowest hero in the game, so increasing their base movement speed allows you to be more mobile when planting traps.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a strong utility item, as it allows Techies to cloak themselves when traversing areas with possible ward coverage. As well, it can be used to help teammates initiate or can drastically increase an ally's magic resistance for a short period of time.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a situational item, but can drastically improve Techies' mobility.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is largely situational, but has strong utility if used properly. The item itself grants tremendous scaling mana regen, allowing Techies to passively regain mana while placing mines in enemy territory. The active can be used to reset the cooldown on Minefield Sign, reducing its downtime from 180 seconds to 15.<br/><br/>Bloodthorn can be an extremely strong late game item if you take the +20% Cooldown Reduction Talent. Combined with Octarine Core it reduces the effective cooldown to 7.8 seconds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Tinker is a very mobile nuking hero with powerful pushing and disabling potential depending on how he is built. He should be played around his ultimate, as it allows him to cast his spells and use his abilities multiple times in a single engagement.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Powerful magical and pure damage nukes, high damage AoE magic damage.<br/><br/>Very hard to push against without specific items or team composition.<br/><br/>Skillful players can outplay multiple opponents by themselves.<br/><br/>Generally extremely effective against single targets with the use of items in conjunction with Rearm.<br/><br/>Semi-Global presence when Boots of Travel are acquired.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Item dependent<br/><br/>Vulnerable to lockdown, fragile, no innate escape mechanism.<br/><br/>High skill ceiling, high levels of awareness and dexterity needed to play effectively.<br/><br/>No answer to Magic Immunity.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>When pushing out lanes, care must be taken to avoid being jumped on by the enemy. Tinker is a very frail hero who, despite his mobility, can be easily killed if caught and disabled.<br/><br/>As well, while Tinker can find farm quite easily by pushing out multiple lanes, doing so can deprive your own teammates of farm, particularly your carries. Combined with the above, this can lead to dangerous situations where your team is unable to do anything without you, and can lead to a loss in the long run as the enemy is able to kill your under-farmed teammates easily if they manage to kill you once. As such, it is recommended not to push out lanes too aggressively or take farm away from your carries if possible.<br/><br/>In general, Tinker is best played in the mid lane, as his skill set allows him to take on most other mids reliably and the farm and early levels allow him to become active much more quickly. He can nuke down and harass the opposing mid and push his lane at will with his abilities, allowing for good rune control.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Laser</h4>Laser is a strong Pure damage nuke that inflicts blind on its target. It is a powerful harassing tool against the enemy mid as the blind allows Tinker to last-hit a creep that the enemy is attempting to deny, or vice versa.<br/><br/>Never underestimate Laser's ability to change the course of an engagement. Using it against an enemy hero prevents them from trading hits due to the miss, and used against the proper target in a teamfight it can force them to retreat or activate a Black King Bar at an inopportune time to remove the blind.<br/><br/>Laser can also be used as a supplementary nuke when pushing a lane. The blindness lasts for 6 seconds on creeps, so it can be used on a siege creep both to remove its attack output and weaken it for March of the Machines.<br/>It can be a nice last hit ability while in the lane, especially against siege creeps due to the pure damage.<br/><br/><h4>Heat-Seeking Missile</h4>Heat-Seeking Missile has an extremely long range. With Rearm, you can continuously spam missiles as to harass enemy heroes and wear them down in preparation of a fight.<br/><br/>Due to its long range, Heat-Seeking Missile is also a good finishing spell for killing fleeing enemies who are low on health. If an enemy has escaped an engagement but is still within vision range, launching a missile can be all that is needed to finish them off.<br/><br/>Remember that vision over the target is required in order for Heat-Seeking Missiles to acquire lock. This means that not only are Observer Wards important in spotting out targets, but that the spell also has great synergy with heroes with vision abilities such as Corrosive Haze, Thirst and Track, which can reveal targets when ward vision is unavailable.<br/><br/>When ganking a target with your burst damage spells and items, it is best to lead off with Heat-Seeking Missile. The travel time can be used to apply a powerful alpha strike to a target by firing the missiles first, and then blinking within range to use your other nukes just as the missiles reach their target.<br/><br/>Combined with Aghanim's Scepter, Heat-Seeking Missiles can lock on to four nearby targets at a time. This can allow Tinker to bombard the entire enemy team with large amounts of magical damage, especially when combined with Rearm, softening them up for teammates.<br/><h4>March of the Machines</h4>March of the Machines is a powerful farming, pushing and counter-pushing spell, as enemies cannot avoid the damage if they wish to attack anything in the affected area. You can overlap several instances of the spell with Rearm, easily nuking down creeps and creating hazard zones that inflict large amounts of damage to enemies who attempt to traverse them.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the drones march in whatever direction Tinker casts the spell in. This can make a major difference when mowing down creep waves, as the drones destroy themselves upon hitting a target. This means that lane creeps can effectively shield each other, leaving certain ones alive for longer (like the ranged creep, which deals the most damage) and preventing others from taking any damage. The most optimal way to March down a wave of lane creeps is in a diagonal angle from behind, so that the drones can hit all of the creeps in the wave, and attack the ranged creeps first.<br/><br/>In general, only two casts of level 4 March of the Machines is necessary for killing a creep wave, provided that they are cast in the proper direction. Remember that the drones take time to deal their damage, so do not get too trigger-happy and waste mana on a third cast if you do not see them doing a lot of immediate damage.<br/><br/>As well, remember that the drones start their March from one end of the area and take time to reach the other end, so casting the spell in one direction causes the drones to spawn from the opposite direction first. This can be important in fights as it can allow you to start applying damage to the enemy team a few seconds earlier, which can make a huge difference.<br/><br/>March of the Machine's wide area allows Tinker to use it to farm down multiple jungle camps at once, both in Radiant and Dire jungles. As well, his global mobility allows him to farm the enemy's jungle if needed, reserving his team's jungle for his team's carries.<br/><br/>It is important to keep in mind that creep movement makes a difference in what direction March of the Machines should be cast in. Casting March in a direction perpendicular to the movement direction of creeps, whether they are lane creeps or neutrals, causes the most number of drones possible to hit them as they travel.<br/><h4>Rearm</h4>Rearm is Tinker's signature ability, allowing him to cast spells and use item abilities profligately as long as he has the mana to do so. Combined with Boots of Travel, it allows Tinker to become one of the most active heroes in the game, globally repositioning himself to push lanes, gank enemies and take map objectives.<br/><br/>Because Rearm increases drastically in mana cost as it is leveled up, only one level in the ability should be taken until at least one large mana item can be purchased to buff up the size of his mana pool. The reduced channel time only matters once you have enough powerful items that you can take advantage of in teamfights.<br/><br/>You can stack commands by holding Shift (also called Shift-queuing) to prevent unintentional Rearm interruptions. Tinker performs queued commands immediately after finishing Rearm.<br/><br/>One of the most important factors in playing Tinker well is efficiently managing his mana pool. As Rearm removes cooldown limitations on his spells and most item abilities, you must carefully decide which spells to cast in a teamfight or when pushing, as well as how to most efficiently cast these spells depending on the situation. Using an unnecessary spell reduces Tinker's ability to cast additional spells in the same engagement, forcing an earlier return back to base and reducing his efficiency.<br/><br/>Always keep enough mana handy to escape and teleport back to base, as Tinker is a very squishy and vulnerable hero when caught out in the open.<br/><br/>When replenishing your mana in your fountain, remember that it heals as a percentage of your maximum HP and mana, and adds a flat amount on top. Therefore, it is possible to reduce down time in the fountain by moving your core items to your stash in order to reduce the size of your mana pool, thus increasing the effectiveness of the flat regen. Combined with a Bottle, this can drastically reduce your turnaround time, allowing you to get back into the action faster.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango combined with a Healing Salve give Tinker enough HP regen to survive harassment in-lane.<br/><br/>Clarity is useful for replenishing Tinker's mana so that he can always have the mana to push out a lane with March of the Machines or have enough nuke power to attempt a kill.<br/><br/>Mantle of Intelligence gives Tinker more base damage as well as a bigger starting mana pool. It is useful for helping with Tinker's last-hitting and casting in-lane.<br/><br/>Iron Branches are cheap and give simple stats to help with the early game. Branches can later be built into a Magic Wand if needed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are basic mobility requirements for any hero. Getting them early on Tinker allows him to more easily position himself for casting his spells.<br/><br/>Bracer gives Tinker more stats, particularly strength to give him more HP and thus survivability.<br/><br/>Bottle is essential for a mid Tinker, as it provides HP and mana regen critical for allowing him to stay in-lane to farm. Bottle remains vital on Tinker throughout the game, as it extends his mana pool when teleporting forward to cast spells and speeds up healing in fountain, so consider dropping it in the Stash instead of selling it later.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Boots of Travel provide global mobility and map presence in the form of teleportation to any friendly building or creep. Combined with Rearm, Tinker can reposition himself globally at will to swiftly push lanes, join teamfights, and then return to the fountain to replenish his mana.<br/><br/>Soul Ring greatly extends Tinker's mana pool when teleporting around the map to cast spells, as he can dip into his HP pool to extend his active operation time. As he can reset its cooldown at will with Rearm, using Soul Ring once per cycle can give him vastly more mana to use. As well, he can offset the HP cost via the use of Bottle, keeping him at full HP even with regular use.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger drastically improves Tinker's mobility, and gives him great survivability when pushing lanes with March of the Machines. As it can be shift-queued after teleporting to the front lines, Tinker can instantly blink into the treeline to safely cast his spells without giving the enemy an opportunity to spot him.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Scythe of Vyse greatly improves the size of Tinker's mana pool, and gives him powerful mana regen, increasing the number of spells he can cast on deployments before returning to base. The Hex is extremely powerful as combined with Rearm it allows Tinker to permanently hard-disable an enemy for as long as he has the mana to do so.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Tinker much needed intelligence to continue use of Rearm, and gives him a magic nuke to assist in pushing. The extra armor and passive attack speed slow also give him resistance against physical damage if he shows up to teamfights, and the active nuke can be refreshed and cast multiple times.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a good cheap mana item that gives Tinker good mana regen and a useful disable. Used properly, the Cyclone can be used to set up disables on enemies offensively, or buy Tinker time if he's caught while pushing a creep wave.<br/><br/>Force Staff extends the size of Tinker's mana pool and gives him a re-positioning tool should he or his team run into trouble. In ganks, it is also a cheap tool to use to break a target's Linken's Sphere so that further disables can be easily targeted.<br/><br/>Dagon is a very powerful burst damage nuke on Tinker that additionally increases the size of his mana pool as it is upgraded. Combined with Laser and Heat-Seeking Missile, it can instantly blow up lone targets, especially once combined with Rearm to increase the damage output by multiples.<br/><br/>Manta Style is useful for giving Tinker stats across the board, increasing his survivability, but its main use is in using the active to dispel debuffs from yourself and giving the enemy multiple targets to pick from. Under the right circumstances, Tinker can cause enough confusion in order to give himself enough time to escape.<br/><br/>Black King Bar prevents Tinker from being locked down in teamfights, particularly since Rearm is a channeled spell that can be interrupted. While it cannot be refreshed by Rearm, it can give Tinker the survivability he needs to cast his spells uninterrupted in a fight.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives Tinker a vast amount of teamfight contribution, as he can use Laser to blind and deal Pure damage to multiple enemy heroes per cast, forcing them to dispel the debuff if they want to deal any physical damage, and bombarding them with long-range artillery using Heat-Seeking Missile.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel 2 is a useful upgrade to Boots of Travel for engaging in fights at inopportune locations. The ability to teleport to allied heroes rather than just creeps allows Tinker to bring instant reinforcements to any unfolding fight, particularly if they take place where there are no friendly creeps to jump to.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape can be a strong survivability item, both for Tinker and his team. As he can constantly have the effect up with Rearm, Tinker becomes much harder to catch since the enemy must bring detection, and their magic nukes become far less potent for focusing him down. In fights, Tinker can use the active on multiple allies simultaneously, allowing him to either save them en masse or give them increased initiation ability.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb is an extremely strong defensive item, both for pushing and for teamfighting. Echo Shell can prevent enemies from easily disabling Tinker, as using targeted disables or nukes reflects them back, disabling or nuking the enemy in turn and forcing them to reconsider the engagement. As well, since Echo Shell can be refreshed with Rearm, it can be placed on multiple allies at once, giving your team a strong edge in fights.<br/><br/>Null Talisman is a better item to build than Bracer, as it provides Tinker with more damage, which helps with last-hitting. As such, it is advised to start with a Null Talisman when playing mid, as the extra damage can make a huge difference against certain lane opponents. As well, it builds into a Dagon, which is far more useful on Tinker than a Drum of Endurance.<br/><br/>Observer Wards are very important to purchase on Tinker due to his mobility. As he can jump immediately to the front lines with Boots of Travel, he is uniquely qualified for placing aggressive wards that his team can capitalize on. Forward wards can give him advance warning on incoming ganks, as well as provide vision for painting targets with Heat-Seeking Missile.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence is a powerful intelligence item to build on Tinker, as it gives many of the same bonuses as a Scythe of Vyse. It can serve as a complementary disable to Hex as Tinker can permanently silence a target in a teamfight when combined with Rearm, allowing him to use Soul Burn on an important spell caster while reserving Hex for their carry.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos gives Tinker intelligence and some more HP, increasing his survivability. While its slow is a much softer disable than a Hex, its long cast range should never be underestimated, and can be useful as a complementary disable.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a powerful utility item to purchase on Tinker. While it only provides mediocre stats and the armor is not always useful on Tinker, the active ability can increase creeps' vulnerability to March of the Machines, allowing him to push more efficiently. As well, used in a teamfight it can drastically improve the effectiveness of Heat-Seeking Missiles and March of the Machines, to say nothing of Dagon or any magic nukes your teammates have. Combined with Rearm, you can ensure that the enemy is permanently inflicted with reduced magic resistance.<br/><br/>Bloodstone can be upgraded from Soul Ring, though it is recommended to purchase a second Soul Ring afterward as the extra 150 mana per cast of Rearm is very powerful. Bloodstone drastically improves Tinker's HP and mana pool, allowing him to cast many more spells on rotations. As well, the active can be reset by Rearm, ensuring that you are always able to deny yourself whenever caught by the enemy. The reduction in respawn time is also very powerful, as Tinker can return to being active on the map faster, preventing the enemy from capitalizing on his death to take map objectives.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade does not give Tinker very beneficial stats, however it is useful for augmenting Tinker's already impressive burst magic damage against enemies, especially if he has built numerous intelligence items, and can be used on himself or teammates to grant immunity against physical damage. In a pinch, it can also be used on one of the enemy's carries to prevent them from attacking if Laser was already used on another target.<br/><br/>Heaven's Halberd is situational pick-up if you are being threatened by heroes relying on basic attacks such as Ursa and Huskar, allowing you to disable their auto-attack for 6–9 seconds per cast between the Halberd's Disarm and your Laser. As well, it can be useful to get if the enemy has built a Monkey King Bar to negate the miss chance of Laser. It may seem superfluous however, when compared to Scythe of Vyse which serves a similar function.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Visage is a highly flexible Hero, able to push and gank very effectively, packing within his abilities a massive nuke with very low cooldown and one powerful slow, useful for taking down enemies when ganking. He is also a strong teamfighter, able to cause tons of damage and apply long-lasting disables with his Familiars, which give Visage its fame for his difficult learning curve, due to his dependence on effective micromanagement of those. Once mastered, Visage becomes a devastating support, with a mix between physical damage, magical damage and long length disables and able to push, gank and fight with his Familiars.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Deals large amounts of single target damage.<br/><br/>Can end up being extremely durable.<br/><br/>Capable of quickly transitioning into a semi-carry with successful ganks.<br/><br/>Movement Speed and attack speed drain, which can be useful in many ways.<br/><br/>AoE long length stun.<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Vulnerable early game.<br/><br/>Level dependent.<br/><br/>Requires intermediate micro skills.<br/><br/>Loses effectiveness if Familiars are dead.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Visage's abilities make him a very strong hero to have in teamfights, as he can bring a powerful array of nukes and disables to bear. He can also use his spells effectively in ganks to jump on and disable targets with little warning and burst them down quickly.<br/><br/>Unlike most intelligence supports, Visage is a very survivable caster due to possessing a high strength growth and powerful damage resistance in Gravekeeper's Cloak. Combined with his other spells, Visage can engage enemies head-on in teamfights and hold his own in the initiation phase.<br/><br/>With a 0.2 second cast animation and long cast ranges on his spells, Visage has great reach if played properly. However, his low base movement speed and slow turn rate also make him relatively sluggish, so positioning is important if he is to take advantage of his strengths.<br/><br/>While Visage is mainly played as a support, he can also become a strong semi-carry if given some farm priority. He can be played as a hard support or a farming support, depending on what his team needs, and transition into a roaming, ganking and split-pushing role.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Grave Chill</h4>Grave Chill is a targeted disable that reduces the enemy's movement and attack speed while boosting up Visage's.<br/><br/>Because of its scaling, only one early point in Grave Chill is needed. Each additional level only increases its duration slightly, and the reduced cooldown does not become useful until much later in the game.<br/><br/>Grave Chill is a very strong ganking spell, as it can inflict a strong slow on an enemy while also robbing them of attack speed, allowing Visage to position himself to easily body-block the enemy's escape path while bursting them down with right-click attacks. These aspects also make Grave Chill a strong counter-gank spell, since it can greatly hinder an enemy that is chasing a weakened ally and reduce their ability to finish off their target with right-clicks, allowing Visage to turn the tables on them.<br/><br/>The increased attack speed provided by Grave Chill means that Visage benefits from building intelligence items rather than simply mana items. Not only will increased intelligence give Visage a bigger mana pool, but it will also increase his base damage to allow him to use his right-clicks more effectively due to the attack speed bonus.<br/><h4>Soul Assumption</h4>Soul Assumption is a potentially powerful damage nuke that increases in strength based on the amount of damage that heroes in Visage's vicinity take.<br/><br/>Soul Assumption makes Visage extremely powerful in tri-lanes, as the amount of damage dealt during ganks and small-scale engagements allow Visage to quickly build up Soul Assumption charges to launch a powerful nuke at an enemy. Additionally, its extremely short cooldown allows it to be cast more than once in a fight, which can allow Visage to deal more and more damage the longer a fight drags on.<br/><br/>Soul Assumption's long cast range makes it a powerful finishing nuke against fleeing enemies. If an enemy has been weakened by allied attacks and spells and is almost about to escape, casting Soul Assumption on them can often be enough to finish them off if the salvo has built up enough charges.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Soul Assumption builds charges based on damage taken on both sides. This means that not only can Visage add more damage on top of his teammates' when damaging an enemy, but also when allies or Visage himself take damage, making it a strong nuke no matter which side is ganking.<br/><br/>Due to the limited window during which charges are maintained, Soul Assumption is more powerful in situations where burst damage is being dealt, as damage-over-time spells can result in charges expiring over time.<br/><br/>Because of its high nuking potential, Visage benefits greatly from maxing out Soul Assumption first among his abilities. The huge nuke potential of the spell allows Visage to deal large amounts of damage whenever fights break out, giving his team more chances at getting kills against the enemy.<br/><br/>Beware that since Soul Assumption has a very low cooldown, it is easy to run out of mana to cast it if used repeatedly. Be mindful of when kill opportunities are possible, and try to conserve Visage's mana as needed.<br/><br/>Due to its low cooldown, Soul Assumption can be cast as an initiating nuke to break an enemy's Linken's Sphere prior to slowing them with Grave Chill. After breaking an enemy's Linken's Sphere, Grave Chill's low cooldown allows it to be cast at least two more times without interference.<br/><h4>Gravekeeper's Cloak</h4>Gravekeeper's Cloak is a powerful survivability passive that gives Visage increased armor and magic resistance.<br/><br/>The layered nature of Gravekeeper's Cloak makes Visage quite resistant to burst damage, which can help him to shrug off initiation nukes by the enemy. However, this also makes Visage very weak against damage over time spells, as multiple small instances of damage can easily shred the resistance layers and leave Visage open to nukes.<br/><br/>Getting multiple early levels of Gravekeeper's Cloak can make Visage quite survivable in the early game, particularly when few enemies have the attack speed to use their auto-attacks to quickly shred the cloak. However, beware if the enemy team's composition is capable of dealing damage over time, which can easily negate armor layers.<br/><br/>Even with multiple levels in Gravekeeper's Cloak, it is recommended to build up Visage's armor and magic resistance, in order to give him some measure of survivability if he must engage the enemy without his armor layers. Armor is more helpful than magic resistance in this regard, since Visage's abnormally high strength growth means that he will eventually have enough HP to outright ignore most magic nukes.<br/><h4>Summon Familiars</h4>Summon Familiars allows Visage to summon two Familiars that can roam the battlefield.<br/><br/>Proper Familiar management is crucial in order to play Visage effectively. Used properly, the Familiars allow Visage to gank targets, push undefended lanes, chain-disable multiple enemies, and deal large amounts of burst damage in fights.<br/><br/>Unlike other summons, Familiars will last until they are destroyed, and can still be controlled even if Visage himself is dead. Try to always be active with the Familiars, using them to accomplish tasks no matter Visage's status.<br/><br/>The most powerful aspects of Visage's Familiars is that they possess flying movement that allows them to ignore terrain. However, while they are very mobile they also have extremely poor vision range and extremely low attack range, making them poor scouters and forcing them to attack enemies at close range.<br/><br/>Familiars' charge-based attacks and low base attack time allow them to deal tremendous burst physical damage to enemies when they focus their fire. Combined with their flying mobility, Familiars become powerful gankers and can quickly kill fragile supports behind enemy lines. However, their reliance on damage charges in order to deal damage also cause their attacks to become extremely weak after expending all their attack charges.<br/><br/>Because of their ability to ignore terrain, Familiars can find safety in hovering over trees, where the enemy cannot easily find them. They can also escape destruction by flying over impassable terrain in order to prevent enemies from easily pursuing.<br/><br/>Remember that the Familiars do not have to be at Visage's side all the time. There are many strong advantages to moving them all around the map, since they can be used to assist teammates who are ganking on a different part of the map, push an undefended lane, attack the enemy from behind during a teamfight, and many other uses. Be creative with how the Familiars are used, and try to always catch the enemy off-guard.<br/><br/>Be very wary of the long cooldown on Summon Familiars, and try not to allow the enemy to kill the Familiars. Not only will this give the enemy a large gold bounty, but can leave Visage without his primary method of burst damage when he needs them.<br/><br/>If the enemy is about to kill the Familiars and they have no path to escape, casting Summon Familiars will instantly kill any active Familiars, preventing the enemy from getting a gold or experience bounty. However, beware that this will also leave Visage without his Familiars for an extended period of time if they are killed again.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve help Visage sustain his HP during the laning phase, preventing him from returning to base due to enemy harassment.<br/><br/>Clarity allows Visage to maintain his mana in order to cast his spells in the laning phase, particularly Soul Assumption, which costs roughly half of his base mana pool and can be important for securing kills during ganks.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection mitigates Visage's poor base armor, giving him resistance to physical harass damage in the early game when he has no levels in Gravekeeper's Cloak. It also builds into a Ring of Basilius from the Side Lane Shop without being forced to return to base or use the courier.<br/><br/>Two Iron Branches are cheap and give Visage a small amount of attributes, a useful way to spend his remaining gold. They can be sold for inventory space, or used to build Magic Wand or Mekansm components.<br/><br/>Animal Courier and Flying Courier should be prioritized for the supports to purchase when needed.<br/><br/>Observer Ward and Sentry Ward are important support items to buy regularly. Observer Wards give Visage's team map vision and allow Visage to better position his Familiars to take advantage of gank opportunities, while Sentry Wards allow Visage to take map vision away from the enemy; as well, Familiars can use their small vision radius to scout high ground areas for enemy wards after placing a Sentry Ward on lower ground to cover more detection area.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are necessary to rectify Visage's poor movement speed. Getting boots as early as possible in the laning phase allows Visage to pursue enemies during ganks, particularly to get within range to cast Grave Chill to slow them.<br/><br/>Magic Stick is a useful burst healing/mana item if the enemies in lane will be casting many spells. It can later be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius, upgraded from Ring of Protection, gives Visage's lane increased physical survivability and some mana regen to sustain spell casting. Past the laning stage, it can be disassembled and the Sage's Mask recycled for other items.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Power Treads is a well-rounded boots upgrade that gives Visage many useful benefits. It boosts his attack speed to allow him to utilize his physical attacks more often, boosted further by Grave Chill, and the attribute switching allows him to give himself more HP or more mana and base damage depending on the situation.<br/><br/>Magic Wand, built up from Magic Stick, gives Visage bonus attributes and increased charge storage for burst regen. As a support, Visage can benefit greatly from both if lacking farm.<br/><br/>Mekansm gives Visage increased utility and allows him to further support his team through healing them. The increased attributes and armor also vastly boost Visage's durability, making him tankier in fights and allowing him to contribute more.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a powerful utility support item in Visage's hands. The item provides armor and mana regen, giving Visage more survivability and maintaining his mana pool. The active allows him to either buff up an ally's armor to help them in fights, or reduce an enemy's armor to increase the amount of damage they take from allies, Visage's attacks, and most importantly his Summon Familiars.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll is important to carry on all heroes at all times. Visage's ability to nuke and disable with his spells makes him a powerful ally to have in any engagement.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter is a powerful item for Visage, as an extra Familiar will increase his burst damage output by 50%, as well as allowing for increased stagger stun duration with Stone Form. The item also provides Visage with all-around attributes, giving him more HP and mana.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is a strong support item that, while expensive, provides extremely strong benefits. The all-around stats, larger mana pool and increased mana regeneration allow Visage to better contribute in teamfights, and the instant hard-disable can be crucial for getting off successful ganks and disabling important targets in teamfights.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard boosts Visage's survivability against physical damage and greatly improves his mana pool and base damage. The active can be used as a slow and nuke, further slowing an enemy alongside Grave Chill and building up damage for Soul Assumption.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass greatly boosts Visage's armor and attack speed, making him a strong presence in teamfights and ganks. The aura can boost his Familiars' attack speed and reduce enemies' armor to allow the Familiars' attacks to deal additional damage.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos provides Visage with more health, more intelligence for mana and base damage, and a long-ranged slow on a low cooldown. It can greatly increase Visage's ability to chase down foes as he can catch them at long range with the active, then close in to further debilitate them with Grave Chill.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque will vastly improve Visage's overall health and health regeneration, greatly increasing his survivability in fights.<br/><br/>Mjollnir is a powerful damage item, greatly boosting Visage's attack speed. The Chain Lightning modifier, as well as the Static Charge active, can allow Visage to deal vast amounts of area damage to build up charges for Soul Assumption throughout an engagement.<br/><br/>Solar Crest, upgraded from Medallion of Courage, provides many of the same benefits. The increased armor and mana regen give Visage even more tankiness and helps keep his mana topped up even in the late game, while the evasion allows him to dodge attacks and prevent the enemy from easily wearing down Gravekeeper's Cloak charges. The active also works to give teammates even more survivability or increasing enemies' vulnerability to Familiar attacks.<br/><br/>Gem of True Sight can be carried relatively safely on Visage, as he possesses survivability in Gravekeeper's Cloak. As with Sentry Wards, he can use his Familiars to scout high ground to spot and destroy enemy Observer Wards.<br/><br/>Blade Mail is an unorthodox survivability item that gives Visage useful bonuses. The armor gives him survivability against physical damage, while the intelligence and bonus damage give him more mana and increase the effectiveness of his auto-attacks, making him a bigger threat with Grave Chill. The active can act as a second layer of defense once Gravekeeper's Cloak has been exhausted, discouraging the enemy from attacking him while his defenses are weakened.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a useful utility and support item. It gives Visage more intelligence, increasing his base damage and the size of his mana pool, and provides some HP regen to keep his HP topped up. The active allows Visage to quickly re-position himself to cast his spells during ganks and fights, and can act as an escape if needed. It can also be cast on teammates caught out of position in order to save them.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is an expensive investment, but can greatly increase Visage's mobility. The increased movement speed allows him to more easily position himself to cast his spells or pursue enemies with Grave Chill, and the teleport can be targeted on his Familiars, allowing him to effectively re-position himself anywhere he wishes on the map.<br/><br/>Necronomicon gives Visage increased teamfight, ganking and pushing ability. The item provides more strength and intelligence, giving Visage more HP, mana and base damage, and the summons can be used to help the Familiars push, or provide more damage output in a teamfight. Upgraded to level 3, the Necronomicon Warrior also provides True Sight, giving Visage increased utility.<br/><br/>Dagon increases Visage's ability to gank and solo-kill enemies. Besides giving him all-around attributes and increased intelligence for mana and base damage, the active nuke allows Visage to instantly build up Soul Assumption charges, greatly increasing his burst damage potential.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity gives Visage more support and utility power. The item provides Visage with more intelligence and mana regeneration, greatly increasing his ability to cast spells, and the bonus movement speed allows him to more easily position himself for casting spells or chasing with Grave Chill. The active can allow Visage to remove debuffs from himself while making himself temporarily invulnerable, or can hard-disable an enemy at range to set them up for Stone Form stuns.<br/><br/>Desolator is a relatively cheap item that increases Visage's semi-carry potential. It increases Visage's physical attack power, giving him more damage output when combined with Grave Chill, and the armor reduction on targets will increase their vulnerability to his Familiars' attacks.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight can give Visage increased survivability and utility for his team. The magic resistance allows Visage to weather magic nukes more effectively when Gravekeeper's Cloak is down, and the magic barrier can shield teammates from magic damage during fights.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence is a useful semi-carry item with an easy buildup that increases Visage's ganking prowess depending on the enemy lineup. It gives Visage many useful benefits, including physical damage output, more mana and powerful mana regeneration. The silence can prevent enemies from casting escape spells during ganks, and deal powerful burn damage from Visage's powerful burst damage at the end of the silence.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi is an expensive semi-carry item, but gives Visage many powerful benefits. It gives Visage stats across the board, increasing his tankiness, physical damage output, and mana. The attack modifier stacks on top of Grave Chill, greatly slowing an enemy for Visage to bring down with his attacks and Familiar burst.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves is a very powerful support item that gives Visage powerful utility in teamfights. The increased attributes and aura make Visage much tankier, and he can heal himself while also removing negative debuffs with the active.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Warlock is a powerful spellcaster capable of turning the tide of teamfights, bringing the Hell powers with his abilities, bonding his enemies to suffer with the same catastrophic fate. He is almost entirely dependent on good positioning, due to lack of front line abilities, but has great cast ranges on his abilities, allowing you to disrupt your enemies from long distances. Warlock also brings a good healing that can also be used to damage enemies, doing a fine job as a lane partner. His ultimate, Chaotic Offering, calls down a powerful summon along with a magic immunity piercing stun that covers the battlefield almost entirely, causing some huge troubles to your enemies.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Many teamfight abilities.<br/><br/>Has a good heal/damage ability.<br/><br/>The Golem can unleash tons of AoE damage, rather efficient for farming waves or the jungle.<br/><br/>Huge AoE 84% slow ( Upheaval).<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>No good escape ability<br/><br/>Mildly low mana pool.<br/><br/>Upheaval requires channeling.<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Warlock is renowned as a strong teamfight hero whose spells can shift the tide of engagements against multiple foes. While he does not possess any immediate single-target hard disables or instant-damage nukes, his spells provide powerful area disable and crowd control, making him a dangerous foe in teamfights.<br/><br/>Despite being an intelligence caster, Warlock has very respectable strength growth, giving him strong survivability against magic and pure damage nukes. However, he also suffers from extremely poor base agility and agility growth, making him vulnerable to physical damage.<br/><br/>Because he relies mostly on casting spells in order to be effective, Warlock should build items that provide him with more mana, mana regen, and mobility. Having a sustainable source of mana allows Warlock to remain active on the map to support his team, and mobility allows Warlock to more easily position to cast his spells. Once he meets his minimum requirements, he can focus on building utility items to help his team, and survivability items to ensure that he does not die before getting his spells off.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Warlock has a very long cast animation, 0.5 seconds on all but Fatal Bonds. This means that positioning and planning ahead are key to using the hero effectively, as his spells take more time to cast than most other heroes.<br/><br/>In general, Warlock should be played as a safe lane support hero rather than as a core farmer. Although he can scale better than most other supports due to the nature of his spells, he is more dependent on levels than on gold, so foregoing farm in favor of supporting can still allow him to contribute to his team.<br/><br/>When you play Warlock, awareness is key. He does not have a good escape, and can be easily caught by ganks if there is no vision.<br/><br/>Warlock can often turn the tide of teamfights due to his many teamfighting abilities, so always carry a Town Portal Scroll and try to get to a team fight as soon as possible if you were not in it initially.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fatal Bonds</h4>Fatal Bonds is a unit-targeted debuff that allows Warlock to link multiple enemies together to deal bonus damage to each one when one of their allies takes damage.<br/><br/>Fatal Bonds is a very powerful teamfight ability, as it can cause area-of-effect spells that hit all bonded units to deal more than twice its listed damage to each foe. While it should not be the first spell that you max out, it should still be a priority spell to level up, and cast as early as possible in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Because of its extremely long cast range and short cast animation, Fatal Bonds should be the first spell cast in a teamfight. However, be mindful that it will only bond enemies that are currently visible, so make sure to wait for the right moment in order to catch the maximum number of enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Fatal Bonds selects which units to bond based on proximity to the target. Keep this in mind when selecting an enemy to cast the spell on, and try to target it on an enemy in the center of a group of other enemy heroes to maximize the chances of bonding heroes rather than creeps.<br/><br/>When deciding at what time to skill Fatal Bonds, gauge how active your team will be in engaging the foe in major teamfights. If you do not expect to encounter 5-vs-5 teamfights early on, then it is safe to level up your other abilities first. However, if the enemy team is employing an early pushing strategy, threatening them with large amounts of shared damage that is magnified by area-of-effect nukes can give them pause.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Fatal Bonds damage is reduced by each individual target's resistances, so dealing reduced damage to an enemy with high armor or magic resistance will not propagate that reduction to other shackled units. However, the reverse also applies, as dealing large amounts of damage to an enemy with little armor or magic resistance will not amplify the damage shared by an enemy that is more resilient.<br/><br/>Fatal bonds can be cast from 1000 units away, so Warlock does not need to get close to use this.<br/><br/>The shared damage is not reduced by the armor or resistance of the hero that initially took the damage, so it can kill off the enemy team if a high physical damage carry focuses on a high hp/armor enemy hero.<br/><br/>The damage has no maximum range, so it prevents enemy heroes from escaping from a fight on low hp if they are linked to a hero still in the fight.<br/><br/>Fatal bonds can stack, so you can apply another stack of fatal bonds and have each unit take 50% of the damage that any one of them takes.<br/><h4>Shadow Word</h4>Shadow Word is Warlock's most flexible spell, capable of healing allies or damaging enemies, is effective in disabling items like Blink Dagger.<br/><br/>Shadow Word should be the first spell to max out in most situations, as it can serve as a powerful nuke or a life-saving heal at any point in a match.<br/><br/>Shadow Word costs 90 mana to heal/damage 180 HP at level 1, and will consume about a third of your mana pool to do so. Therefore, it is wise to avoid casting the spell at level 1 if at all possible, as it becomes much more efficient with additional levels.<br/><br/>Beware that although Shadow Word can heal a single ally by more than 500 HP, it takes time to do so. Therefore, it should be cast as early as possible when a situation arises, so that your ally is not put in a situation where they might not have enough HP to survive long enough to benefit from the healing buff.<br/><br/>Unlike certain healing spells, Shadow Word can be cast on spell immune allies. If an ally has activated their Black King Bar, Warlock can still target them with Shadow Word to heal them if they run into trouble.<br/><br/>Offensive shadow words are less effective in the mid-late game, due to the relatively low help it provides the team in comparison to Warlock's other abilities.<br/><br/>Shadow Word can help Warlock to stay longer in the lane and win the lane, by either casting offensive Shadow Words so that the enemy heroes are forced to stay back, or by allowing Warlock and his allies to remain at high health at all times.<br/><h4>Upheaval</h4>Upheaval is a very large area slow with a very long cast range, capable of inflicting an increasingly powerful slow from up to 1850 range away.<br/><br/>Despite its long cast range and wide radius of effect, Upheaval's slow takes time to build up, and ramps up very slowly at early levels. Try to avoid channeling the spell unless it is at least level 2 or 3, as it is otherwise a waste of mana.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Upheaval becomes stronger based on how long it is channeled, not how long an enemy was standing in it, and that the slow sticks on the target up to 3 seconds after leaving the area. Because of this, it is more effective to preemptively channel Upheaval where the enemy wants to pass through to give it time to build up, rather than casting the whirlpool on top of a foe's current location, since they can simply walk out of the whirlpool before they can be slowed too much.<br/><br/>Upheaval can be used as a ganking disable once it has at least two points put into it, and combined with a leading stun to give the slow time to build up. Provided that Warlock's teammates have enough damage output, slowing the enemy down can be much more beneficial than attacking with right-clicks.<br/><br/>Be sure to take advantage of Upheaval's long cast range whenever possible. The enemy will be sure to attempt to disable you to interrupt the channeling, however, you can make this much harder for them by forcing them to find you first. You can shield yourself behind teammates, from inside the treeline or on high ground, and even cast it from an unexpected direction so that they search in the wrong place.<br/><br/>Upheaval's primary use comes right after initiating or counter-initiating with Fatal Bonds and Chaotic Offering, as Warlock can use the slow to greatly hinder enemy heroes' ability to escape while the golem attacks them. The enemy may choose to expend one of their disables to interrupt the channeling or choose to try to focus down Warlock while he is vulnerable, so make sure to position appropriately. Self-casting Shadow Word prior to channeling can also aid in survivability during Upheaval.<br/><br/>In a pinch, Upheaval can be used to cover retreats, or for area denial. Casting the spell on an area that the enemy wants to traverse can give them pause, as walking into an active Upheaval will slow them down much more than if it was cast on top of them. This can be useful for giving teammates space to run away, or for preventing the enemy from entering an area that they wish to go (such as pushing up high ground into your base, or into/out of Roshan's pit).<br/><br/>Beware, Upheaval is a percent-based movement speed slow, and as such can be ignored by certain abilities such as Stampede, Shukuchi, Surge, and so on. Be sure that you know what abilities the enemy has that can ignore Upheaval's debuff, and plan accordingly.<br/><br/>Upheaval gets stronger over time, so it can be used preemptively before a teamfight if you have a low level in it.<br/><h4></h4>Chaotic Offering<br/><br/>[edit | edit source]<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>As noted earlier, Warlock should generally carry at least some of the support duties on his team. This means that Animal Courier, Flying Courier, Observer Ward, Sentry Ward, and other support items such as Dust of Appearance and Smoke of Deceit should all take priority.<br/><br/>Healing Salve is generally required in most starting item builds, in order to allow players to stay in lane despite harass damage from the enemy. Shadow Word can replace the utility of Tango during the laning stage for replenishing small amounts of HP.<br/><br/>Clarity is recommended in order to take advantage of Warlock's powerful utility spells when they are needed. A Clarity can guarantee at least one more additional cast of Shadow Word or any of your other spells.<br/><br/>Ring of Protection is helpful for protecting Warlock against enemy harass damage, and allows you to build a Ring of Basilius from the Side Lane Shop.<br/><br/>Iron Branch should be used to fill out the rest of your inventory, as they are cheap and the attributes they provide can be very useful in the early game. They can be used to complete a Magic Wand, or build Mekansm components.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Magic Stick is recommended for most heroes. In Warlock's case, his low base strength means that he is relatively easy to kill in the early game, so having the ability to instantly heal yourself for 150 HP is very helpful. The 150 MP also allows you to cast at least one more spell in a teamfight if your mana is low.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are important on any support. In Warlock's case, the flexibility of Shadow Word means that positioning yourself quickly to cast it on an ally or enemy can help to secure a kill on the enemy or save an ally from death.<br/><br/>Bracer provides additional attributes and bonus strength to bulk up Warlock's small base health pool, greatly increasing his survivability in fights.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius is useful for providing armor and mana regen during the laning stage, which aids in survivability and replenishing mana for casting Shadow Word, as well as pushing a lane if needed by turning the aura on. It is best disassembled and the components recycled for use in other items, however, as Warlock's high base intelligence as well as growth ensure that a Sage's Mask is more effective early on due to its percentage-based regen bonus.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Magic Wand provides all the benefits of a Magic Stick, as well as additional stats to increase your survivability. Using stored charges can give Warlock enough mana to cast almost any spell in his arsenal, and can often be enough to cast your ultimate if you're low.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots are important in aiding Warlock's ability to support his team, on top of replenishing his own mana pool so that he can continue using his spells. As he can already heal his teammates with Shadow Word, replenishing their mana as well as Warlock's ensures that your team is ready to fight at any time, or that your carry can continue farming without having to return to base as often.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter should be considered a luxury item if playing a hard support role, but it is also one of the most powerful items that Warlock can purchase, especially when given farm priority. The ability to summon two golems with Chaotic Offering can inflict significantly more damage against the enemy as neither Permanent Immolation or Flaming Fists have their effectiveness reduced.<br/><br/>Due to Warlock's flexible nature and powerful spells, a Town Portal Scroll should always be on hand should it be needed. Warlock's ability to heal teammates in emergency situations and disrupt the enemy formation with his spells should never be discounted.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Refresher Orb is a very powerful luxury item in that it allows Warlock to use his ultimate twice, whether it has been upgraded by Aghanim's Scepter or not, as well as double-stack Fatal Bonds since repeated casts will work independently rather than refresh its duration. While it provides immense mana regen to allow more frequent use of spells, priority should be given to increasing the size of Warlock's mana pool should this be purchased, as his ultimate and Refresher Orb's active can cost a total of up to 1175 mana, to say nothing of his other abilities.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives Warlock a much larger mana pool as well as regeneration, and shores up his other stats as well. Its Hex ability allows Warlock to instantly disable an enemy from range, greatly increasing his teamfight potential.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard gives Warlock immense survivability against physical attacks, and increases his intelligence dramatically as well, providing a much larger mana pool and more base damage. The auras allow him to contribute more in teamfights by reducing enemy attack and movement speed, giving him more crowd control, reducing enemies' attack speed, and giving him an additional slow on top of Upheaval, which does not have to be channeled and can help his golem to chase opponents.<br/><br/>Necronomicon gives Warlock additional strength and intelligence, giving him HP and mana, as well as the ability to summon Necronomicon Warriors to a teamfight, synergizing well with Chaotic Offering. The minions greatly add to Warlock's teamfight contribution as they can be controlled while Warlock himself is channeling Upheaval.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance can be easily upgraded from Bracer, and gives Warlock all-around additional stats. The aura gives Warlock more teamfight contribution, and the active can give his golem more mobility and damage output.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a powerful support item that gives Warlock another tool with which to protect his teammates. The item's active ability can shield allies from magical damage for a short period of time, enough to blunt their initial wave of magic nukes.<br/><br/>Mekansm is another powerful support item that synergizes well with Shadow Word, allowing Warlock to heal teammates and keep them in the fight. The all-around attributes and armor help make Warlock less squishy, and his high intelligence growth ensures that he can easily afford the mana cost of the active.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord is a useful utility item that boosts Warlock's stats across the board, gives him a large amount of bonus intelligence, and gives him more armor. As Fatal Bonds already amplifies the power of area-of-effect magic nukes that hit multiple targets, increasing that further by reducing enemies' magic resistance can greatly increase the amount of damage dealt.<br/><br/>Octarine Core can be very strong on Warlock in the late game, as it can reduce the cooldown time on his spammable spells and allow him to have his ultimate available on a more regular basis. As well, Warlock can lifesteal from Fatal Bonds damage and an offensively cast Shadow Word, increasing his survivability in fights.<br/><br/>Guardian Greaves is a useful late-game upgrade to Mekansm and Arcane Boots, giving Warlock strong teamfight contribution as well as opening up an inventory slot. The self-dispel allows Warlock to remove debuffs from himself, such as silences that are preventing him from casting his spells.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows synergizes well with Shadow Word, as it performs many of the same roles and augments Warlock's flexibility further. It is a strong utility item to build if you do not intend on buying a Bracer, as the strength and mana regen benefit Warlock greatly.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage, and its upgrade Solar Crest, have a myriad of uses for Warlock. As a ranged support he can use it to assist his carry from a distance either by placing the debuff on an enemy or by placing the buff on an ally. The same can be applied to the golem, either to extend its survivability or weaken its target. Finally, it can be used on Roshan to help your team kill him faster.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a good utility item on any support hero, and is no exception for Warlock. It can allow Warlock to get in position to cast his spells, and has utility in re-positioning teammates as well as displacing enemies, and can even be used on your golem to help it to chase fleeing enemies.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter can be helpful if Warlock is constantly being focused down by the enemy's physical right-clickers. Using Ghost Scepter's active can shield Warlock from physical damage for some seconds, allowing him to cast his spells as needed.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering is a useful mid-game utility item that provides a strong teamfight aura. The aura gives Warlock and his allies additional armor and passive HP regen, as well as increased damage and lifesteal. These bonuses benefit the golem as well, increasing its survivability to get more use out of your ultimate.<br/><br/>Aether Lens, built up from the Energy Booster component of Arcane Boots, greatly improves Warlock's ability to get off his spells in teamfights. The cast range increase further augments his already formidably long cast ranges, allowing him to cast his spells from complete safety behind his team, where the enemy will be unable to catch him.<br/><br/>Shadow Amulet can be useful to purchase if you intend on casting Upheaval frequently. As Warlock often has to channel the spell for at least a few seconds for it to reach full potency, hiding yourself from basic sight can increase your safety and keep the enemy guessing on your location, as the spell's cast range allows you to employ the spell from a fairly safe distance and an angle of your choosing.<br/>Upgrading Shadow Amulet into a Glimmer Cape can give Warlock more utility at the cost of less effective cover while channeling Upheaval. As Warlock can channel Upheaval for up to 16 seconds, purchasing a Glimmer Cape prevents him from remaining invisible for the entire duration as it only lasts for 5 seconds. However, it provides utility in that it can be cast on allies to help them initiate, or protect an ally from magic nukes for a short period of time. It can also be cast on your golem to increase its survivability against any magic nukes the enemy may use to try to kill it.<br/><br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a useful utility caster item that is also cheap to build. It improves Warlock's mobility via increased movement speed, allowing him to more easily position to cast his spells, and provides intelligence and mana regen to improve his ability to cast his spells. The active can give him a hard-disable to use against enemies, or can be used on himself to provide temporary invulnerability while removing debuffs (such as silences that are preventing him from casting his spells).<br/><br/>Rod of Atos is a strong item to purchase on Warlock. The increased health pool gives him more survivability, while the increased intelligence gives him additional base damage and a larger mana pool to work with. The active synergizes with his ability to cast his spells at extremely long range, slowing enemies from long distances and making them easy prey for his golem or pinning them down for Upheaval.<br/><br/>Lotus Orb is a strong utility item that allows Warlock to use the enemies' targeted spells against them. The item provides HP and mana regen as well as armor, giving Warlock more survivability and keeping his HP and mana topped up. The active can be cast on Warlock himself or one of his team's carries, discouraging the enemy from using their targeted nukes and disables. It can also be cast on his golem, but it does not reflect spells.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Windranger is a very flexible hero who can be played in any lane, and who can perform many roles from support-disabler to DPS carry.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Good escape<br/><br/>Great pusher<br/><br/>Strong at any stage of the game<br/><br/>High skill cap<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Farm and level dependent<br/><br/>Low armor/spell resistance<br/><br/>Single-target damage<br/><br/>Requires good positioning<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>In general, Windranger should focus on either maximizing her potential in disabling enemies, or increasing her raw damage and upgrading her ultimate for physical DPS; it is not feasible to aim for both. The former may be done as a support or core, however the latter is only feasible if Windranger is given farm priority.<br/><br/>Played as an off-laner, it is recommended to get Windrun as your first skill in order to give yourself survivability against the enemy's supports. You have decent last-hitting capability due to being a ranged hero with a low base attack time, and your escape skill can save you from ganks if used properly. Once you have enough levels, you can use Powershot to get last-hits from a safe range and to harass down the enemy heroes enough to give yourself a chance at a kill.<br/><br/>As a mid, Windranger should purchase an early Null Talisman for more last-hitting power, and save up for a Bottle to give her mana for her spells. Survivability is less of an issue as the enemy's supports will have to rotate in order to gank you, so priority should be given to beating the enemy's mid and leveling up your nukes and disables so that you have a chance to get a kill.<br/><br/>As a safe-lane support, Windranger can focus on harassing down the enemy's off-laner using her ranged attacks, and landing full-duration Shackleshots during ganks. Priority here is given to protecting the safe-lane carry and shutting down the enemy off-laner, so nukes and disables take priority.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Shackleshot</h4>Shackleshot is potentially a very powerful stun depending on how well it is used. Aimed properly, it is possible to stun two enemy heroes for almost four seconds, giving your team a major opportunity to capitalize on.<br/><br/>Positioning is very important when casting Shackleshot, both on yourself and the enemy. Even if shackling two enemy heroes together is not possible in a fight, tying one enemy hero to a tree or nearby creep still gives you a very long-duration disable. Always keep an eye out for possible latch targets, as Windranger has entire treelines to use when fights occur in either jungle.<br/><br/>Shackleshot is very powerful when used in conjunction with any other leading disable. As smart enemies will deliberately attempt to avoid lining themselves up with creeps or trees to allow themselves to be shackled for the full duration, stopping them in their tracks first will give you much more time to re-position yourself around them and cast Shackleshot from an angle of your choosing.<br/><br/>One important facet to keep in mind about Shackleshot is that you do not have to directly cast it on your target in order to disable them. If there are nearby enemy creeps, you can line up Shackleshot on them, and attempt to latch the enemy player as the spell's secondary target. This can be a very useful tactic if the enemy is deliberately attempting to avoid putting themselves between yourself and the treeline or nearby creeps.<br/><br/>In concert to the above, Shackleshot is capable of latching enemies through Linken's Sphere in this way. By targeting the enemy player as the secondary target of Shackleshot, it is possible to stun them for the full duration regardless of their Linken's Sphere. You can then break the Linken's at your leisure during the stun duration using an expendable targeted ability such as Force Staff.<br/><br/>While Shackleshot's mini-stun is very weak, don't forget that it is a mini-stun regardless. This makes it useful if you need a fast interrupting disable against enemies with powerful channeling spells such as Dismember, Death Ward, and so on.<br/><br/>If there is no tree, secondary Hero or creeps near a Shackleshot target, you can still stun them long enough by using Shackleshot, then quickly use Blink Dagger and place Ironwood Branch behind them.<br/><h4>Powershot</h4>Powershot is a potent damage nuke with an extremely long range. It is generally recommended to max it out first, as its long reach allows you to harass, last-hit, scout and kill from surprising ranges.<br/><br/>Powershot's long range and nuking power makes it ideal for sniping fleeing enemy heroes, as well as hitting invisible enemies that you know the approximate location of. As well, keep in mind that you can hit multiple enemies with it at once, so it pays to line up your shots.<br/><br/>Remember that Powershot grants vision over the arrow's travel path. Use this to your advantage to scout out areas ahead of moving in, such as checking if enemies are waiting behind a certain treeline to gank or if the enemy team is killing Roshan.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Powershot's long range allows Windranger to hit multiple jungle camps with a single cast if she lines it up properly. This allows her to farm surprisingly quickly in the jungle, or even use Powershot to draw aggro and stack more than one neutral camp at once.<br/><h4>Windrun</h4>Windrun is a very flexible spell as it provides Windranger with both movement speed and evasion, allowing it to be used both defensively and offensively. If you expect to encounter ganks from the enemy team, one early level is usually wise.<br/><br/>While the primary use for Windrun is as an escape spell against enemy ganks, it also has uses as an offensive spell. Used aggressively, Windrun allows you to chase down enemies and slow and body-block them for teammates to catch up, and ignore their physical attacks if they try to trade right-clicks with you. The bonus movement speed also allows easier positioning for Shackleshot and Powershot, but mind the mana cost and cooldowns so that you don't get caught short.<br/><br/>If you are getting ganked and cannot outrun the enemy with Windrun, consider activating it once the enemy's disables have been used and then channeling a Town Portal Scroll for escape. The enemy will be unable to hit you with physical attacks, preventing them from killing you as you teleport.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, Windrun combined with Healing Salve will prevent autoattacks from cancelling the salve for its duration, potentially allowing you to survive a tough situation early in lane.<br/><br/>Depending on how much of a threat you are posing to the enemy team, they may buy a Monkey King Bar to counter you. The True Strike allows foes to ignore the evasion from Windrun, so be aware of that possibility if you are relying on Windrun to evade enemy attacks in teamfights.<br/><h4>Focus Fire</h4>Focus Fire is a very potent spell that allows Windranger's physical damage to scale. It is useful to get at least one early level no matter what role she is played in.<br/><br/>An early level of Focus Fire allows Windranger to deal tremendous damage to towers if left alone, as even with a 50% reduction in damage output it can triple her overall damage output due to the attack speed alone. If possible, try to bait out the enemy's Glyph of Fortification prior to casting Focus Fire on their tower, so that they cannot reduce the amount of damage your ultimate does to it.<br/><br/>Unless you are building a DPS-focused Windranger, it is not recommended to target the enemy's main carry with Focus Fire at the start of a teamfight, as it is not guaranteed that you will be able to do so for the full duration of the spell. While you can use the spell to whittle down lone targets during ganks, it is most profitably used against enemy towers if you cannot guarantee that it will do enough damage to the enemy's carry in teamfights.<br/><br/>Due to the amount of raw attack speed that Windranger gets from her ultimate, it may be wise to build attack modifiers with stable proc chances, so that you can proc them multiple times over the course of the ultimate. For instance, a Maelstrom has a 25% chance to proc on each attack and thus can deal a significant amount of magical damage in a short period of time, however a Skull Basher will go into cooldown for two seconds once it procs, preventing you from stun-locking a foe.<br/><br/>If building Windranger for a DPS role, an Aghanim's Scepter is more or less mandatory, as it will remove the damage penalty on her attacks and reduce the cooldown such that she can have Focus Fire active constantly.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Consumables are essential early game due to Windranger's low health and the low cooldown of her spells. As such, one each of Tango and Healing Salve are basic requirements, while a Clarity or two are very helpful in giving her mana to cast her spells.<br/><br/>Grabbing a Mantle of Intelligence provides Windranger with a larger mana pool and some more base damage, and can be upgraded to a Null Talisman. Filling the remainder of your inventory with Iron Branches serves to give you a small amount of stats for cheap, and they can be used to build a Magic Wand later as needed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed are essential on any hero during the laning stage. In Windranger's case, having early boots as an off-laner greatly increases survivability as it enables her to evade ganks more easily, and increases the bonus movement speed gained from Windrun as well.<br/><br/>Null Talisman gives Windranger useful stats for a cheap price. The intelligence gives her more base damage and a larger mana pool, while the strength gives her some survivability. The Null Talisman should be sold later on for more inventory slots, as it does not build into any useful items for Windranger.<br/><br/>Ring of Basilius gives Windranger more armor, some damage and a measure of mana regen, all of which help her survive as an off-laner. However, it should either be disassembled or sold once the laning phase ends, as Windranger can get more mana regen from the Sage's Mask alone later on due to being an intelligence hero, and Ring of Basilius does not build into any useful items.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core items:</b><br/>Phase Boots are very powerful on Windranger, as she can take advantage of the extra damage more than additional attack speed due to her low base attack time and her ultimate Focus Fire. As well, the active greatly helps Windranger with positioning, essential for landing Powershot and Shackleshot.<br/><br/>Force Staff is very effective and versatile for positioning a Shackleshot, allowing you to force a unit in front of a tree, force a creep/unit in front of another unit, or force yourself into position. The additional intelligence gives her more mana and base damage as well, and in emergencies it can be used to displace yourself during escapes.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll should be carried on all heroes. Windranger's ability to disable and nuke down enemies should never be underestimated in teamfights or ganks.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is extremely powerful on Windranger, as it allows her to instantly re-position for her spells, especially Shackleshot. It is a powerful item to buy for initiating for your disables, or for being more evasive. May not give the extra stats provided by Force Staff but allows for faster, further, and Windrun can be activated to avoid physical damage, thus providing more opportunities to blink away from unfavorable situations.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter gives Windranger stats across the board, and greatly improves Windranger's damage output using Focus Fire. As well, the cooldown reduction allows her to cast Focus Fire at will, vastly increasing her damage output and target flexibility.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Desolator gives Windranger additional damage output, as well as an armor reduction debuff that can be applied to buildings as well as heroes. As Windranger is a ranged hero, she can simply "tag" multiple enemies with the debuff prior to focusing on a single target, though it is recommended to purchase Aghanim's Scepter as well in order to maximize your physical DPS.<br/><br/>Mekansm can be very powerful on a support Windranger, as it gives her stats and armor, increasing her survivability and allowing her to heal her team during teamfights.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse is very powerful on Windranger, no matter how she is played. The extra intelligence and mana regen greatly increase her base damage and ability to cast spells, and the additional strength and agility shore up her HP and armor, granting her much more survivability. The hex can be used to instantly hard-disable the enemy's carry in a fight, and serves as a potent complement to Shackleshot.<br/><br/>Orchid Malevolence can greatly increase Windranger's physical damage output, as she will get both more mana and base damage from the extra intelligence, and the attack speed greatly complements her low base attack time. The silence adds yet another disable to Windranger's repertoire, allowing her to lock down enemies who rely on escape spells to survive. Later can be upgraded to a Bloodthorn.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos greatly increases Windranger's survivability as well as her damage output and mana pool. While the slow is not a hard disable, it has a very long cast range and can hold a target down so that Shackleshot may be cast from an angle of Windranger's choosing.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard greatly augments Windranger's survivability against physical damage, and gives her more damage output and mana as well. The active blast can be used when chasing down an enemy with Windrun, slowing them down long enough for teammates to catch up and for Windranger to stun them with Shackleshot.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere gives Windranger stats across the board and powerful mana regen. Its spellblock helps to make Windranger much more slippery when evading enemy ganks, or gives her a larger window of opportunity to cast her disables in a teamfight without being disabled herself.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a good cheap utility item if the aim is not to build raw damage items to fuel Focus Fire. The increased base movement speed greatly augments Windranger's mobility in combination with Phase Boots or Windrun, and the extra intelligence and mana regen give her much more utility with her spells. The active can be used to stop an enemy in their tracks and position yourself for landing a full-duration Shackleshot, or for generally disabling enemies or giving yourself temporary invulnerability (while removing debuffs from yourself) during fights.<br/><br/>Monkey King Bar greatly increases Windranger's damage output, and synergizes well with Focus Fire. The Mini-Bash can proc multiple times during the course of her ultimate, and the True Strike allows her to ignore any evasion or blind that the enemy may have.<br/><br/>If playing as a support, be sure to buy the standard support items. This means upgrading to the Flying Courier, as well as regularly purchasing Observer Wards and Sentry Wards.<br/><br/>As a mid or off-laner, a Bottle is generally recommended. A mid Windranger can take advantage of the regen and runes when rotating to the side lanes for kills, while an off-laning Windranger can use the runes as a source of regen to lend her more survivability.<br/><br/>Bracer can be a good alternative to purchase over Null Talisman, depending on the requirements. While Null Talisman provides more intelligence and thus damage, a Bracer can shore up Windranger's low base strength, giving her survivability in the early game. It also builds into a Drum of Endurance, which gives her stats across the board as well as additional mobility and attack speed, both of which are important on Windranger.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage can be a useful utility item to augment Focus Fire's effectiveness even if you are not building a physical DPS Windranger. The armor gives you more survivability while the mana helps with casting your spells, and the active allows you to deal large amounts of damage to enemies even without a lot of damage items. As well, the active can be used on allies to give them armor, and can be used to make Roshan easier to kill.<br/><br/>Maelstrom is a good attack modifier item to build on Windranger, as it increases her damage and attack speed alongside the Chain Lightning modifier. It allows Windranger to clear creep waves and jungle camps quickly when combined with Powershot, and can be combined with Focus Fire to inflict large amounts of magic damage to the enemy team. Upgrading it to Mjollnir can give you a more powerful Chain Lightning, additional attack speed that gives you DPS without the need for your ultimate, and an active shield that can discourage enemies from attacking you or a chosen ally for fear of taking even more magic damage.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is a good defensive item to build on a DPS Windranger, as you can be sure that the enemy will attempt to disable and focus you down to prevent you from dishing out too much damage in a teamfight. Preventing yourself from being disabled will allow you to take full advantage of Focus Fire during a teamfight, especially as it can be combined with Windrun to give yourself immunity to disables as well as physical attacks.<br/><br/>Diffusal Blade can be a useful utility item to build both as a disable-heavy and physical DPS Windranger, particularly as it is not a Unique Attack Modifier. The mana burn can add a measure of damage to Windranger's attacks, especially combined with Focus Fire, and can be useful for depleting the mana from heroes with small mana pools such as Phantom Assassin, Sven, and so on, so that they do not have the mana to cast their spells. Additionally, the active purge is powerful in any situation in removing debuffs from yourself and allies or buffs from enemies, and slows enemy targets down long enough to position yourself for a full-duration Shackleshot.<br/><br/>Daedalus is very powerful in the hands of a farmed DPS Windranger, as combined with Focus Fire and enough damage it can eviscerate most enemy heroes in seconds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Winter Wyvern is a powerful nuker who also provides utility in her spells, making her a well-rounded support. As she does not require gold in order to be effective, she is well-suited to playing as a hard support, protecting her safe lane carry and rotating to gank with her spells.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Scales well into the late game<br/><br/>Does not need items to do her job, and can focus on warding the map<br/><br/>Is a decent pusher if you use your abilities right<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Falls off mid game when most damage is magic, but comes back online late game when physical carries start to come online<br/><br/>Bad Winter's Curse usage can lose a winning team fight.<br/><br/>Cold Embrace makes the ally unable to move, making them easy prey to magical nukers<br/><br/>Bad movement speed<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Unlike most other intelligence-based casting supports, Winter Wyvern possesses respectable strength growth, making her quite resistant to damage. However, her poor base agility also means that she has low base armor, and can benefit greatly from purchasing items that provide her with bonus armor.<br/><br/>Winter Wyvern has an extremely high cast range for all of her spells, allowing her to impact ganks and teamfights from the back lines without endangering herself. Purchasing mobility items allows her to position herself for casting her spells more easily.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, Winter Wyvern has poor base movement speed and a very slow turn rate, making her quite sluggish; as well, she has a very short attack range and slow projectile speed, as well as poor base damage, making her physical attacks quite ineffective at harassing when not boosted by Arctic Burn. Good positioning and planning is necessary in order to make good use of Auroth's abilities, despite their extremely high cast range.<br/><br/>Much of Winter Wyvern's damage output comes from her basic spells, which are costly and have very low cooldowns. Securing a reliable source of mana regeneration allows Winter Wyvern to keep on the move and enter teamfights ready to use her full arsenal at all times.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arctic Burn</h4>Arctic Burn gives Winter Wyvern flying movement while boosting her attack range and night vision, and causing her attacks to burn a fraction of enemies' current health every second.<br/><br/>As it is her primary mobility spell, maxing out Arctic Burn first can help make Winter Wyvern far more mobile and better able to counter enemy actions. While the HP burn is static, reducing the cooldown and mana cost allows Winter Wyvern to have the spell ready as the situation requires, and helps keep her mana pool full for casting her other spells. As well, the increased slow can help to get kills during ganks, and can greatly inhibit enemy movement during teamfights.<br/><br/>Arctic Burn is also a good spell pick as Winter Wyvern's first ability, as it can be used to initiate a fight by slowing and burning enemy heroes or as an emergency escape spell to evade an enemy gank.<br/><br/>Because Arctic Burn's damage is expressed as a percentage of the target's current health, it is more effective the higher an enemy's health is. Using it at the start of a fight will burn down a larger fraction of the enemy's maximum health, allowing subsequent attacks and spells from teammates to be more impactful.<br/><br/>Always take advantage of the flying movement that Arctic Burn provides. When initiating for a gank or teamfight, Winter Wyvern can soar over trees and ledges/cliffs, attacking the enemy from unexpected directions. When used as an escape, Auroth can escape enemies by flying over impassable terrain, preventing them from easily pursuing.<br/><br/>Arctic Burn's combination of flying movement and attack and night vision range bonuses make Winter Wyvern into a very strong nighttime ganker. The increased night vision lets her spot enemies at very long range, allowing her to choose an advantageous approach angle with her flying movement, while the attack range bonus allows her to attack from outside most enemies' vision range, most importantly to put their Blink Dagger on cooldown for at least 8 seconds.<br/><br/>Be careful about using Arctic Burn to scout, as Winter Wyvern still possesses ground vision and is unable to see up high ground or through trees. If going up high ground, try to take a side approach that takes her in from an unexpected angle (using trees for cover as necessary), rather than directly up a stairway where enemies could be waiting.<br/><h4>Splinter Blast</h4>Splinter Blast fires a shard of ice at a target, splintering upon impact and damaging and slowing all other nearby enemies.<br/><br/>Beware that Splinter Blast does not affect the primary target at all, and as such is useless against lone targets. If trying to damage and slow an enemy with the spell, aim it at a secondary target so that the splinters will bounce to the primary target.<br/><br/>Because of its tremendous nuking potential, Splinter Blast can be a strong spell to max out early in the game. The combination of low cooldown and high area damage allows Winter Wyvern to sweep away creep waves in seconds and deal powerful area damage in fights. In particular, at maximum level Splinter Blast is capable of killing ranged lane creeps in a single cast before the 37:30 mark, giving her strong pushing and counter-pushing capability. Increasing Intelligence or buying Aether Lens can further strengthen her nuke damage and maintain her pushing potential.<br/><br/>Splinter Blast's extremely long cast range allows Winter Wyvern to hit enemies up to 1700 range away. Use this to your advantage in fights to keep as much space between yourself and enemy heroes as possible.<br/><br/>Be mindful that Splinter Blast's initial projectile has a fixed 1 second travel time beyond 650 range, and cannot be disjointed, so it is very adept at catching enemies no matter where they are. As well, the secondary splinters that damage and slow enemies in an area cannot be disjointed either once locked on, which allows Winter Wyvern to splash damage at enemies in many situations where other damage nukes cannot.<br/><br/>Because of its extremely long range and low cooldown, Splinter Blast is a very useful spell for breaking an enemy's Linken's Sphere. In particular, it can clear the way to cast Winter's Curse, and come off cooldown shortly after the taunt.<br/><br/>When casting Splinter Blast against lane creeps, keep in mind that the primary target will take no damage and will not be slowed. If creep positioning permits, try to target Splinter Blast on a siege creep, as their 80% magic resistance makes the secondary damage ineffective against them anyways. However, keep in mind that the siege creeps are usually positioned well behind the rest of a creep wave, meaning that unless the melee creeps are aggroed and brought closer, a Splinter Blast targeted on a siege creep will likely only hit the ranged creeps.<br/><h4>Cold Embrace</h4>Cold Embrace is a powerful protective spell that disables a target ally but nullifies incoming physical damage and heals a sizable fraction of their health.<br/><br/>Because it is a percentage-based spell, Cold Embrace is situationally effective in the early game when health pools are very small. However, the physical damage immunity means that a value point in the skill is very effective since it can be used to save allies who are ganked by enemies, particularly since most magic nukes will drain a sizable fraction of gankers' small mana pools.<br/><br/>Cold Embrace's physical damage negation makes it extremely strong for saving a teammate who has been caught out of position and is being focused down by enemy attacks. The principle is that if an ally is being chain-disabled by the enemy, then casting Cold Embrace on them will not matter, as they were already being stunned and the spell will protect them from physical damage while healing them, wasting the enemy's time.<br/><br/>Beware that while an encased ally is immune to physical damage, they are still affected by secondary attack effects, as well as Magical and Pure damage. This means that Essence Shift will still steal attributes, Mana Break will still destroy mana (but deal no damage), Chilling Touch and Arcane Orb will still deal their Magical and Pure damage components, respectively, and teammates can still be finished off by non-physical nukes like Laguna Blade and Sonic Wave. When choosing whether or not to cast Cold Embrace, be sure to take enemy composition and abilities into account.<br/><br/>This vulnerability to other damage types can be mitigated with the help of allies, however. For instance, Repel can render the target spell immune and thus unable to be damaged by anything short of spell immunity piercing Pure damage, Fate's Edict can block magical damage while leaving the target still able to receive other buffs such as Purifying Flames, and so on.<br/><br/>Cold Embrace is an extremely powerful pushing spell, due to its combination of healing, low cooldown and physical damage immunity.<br/>Because of its percentage-based healing, Cold Embrace can restore a sizable fraction of allies' health, allowing them to continue pushing after a successful teamfight and be ready to engage enemies at full health.<br/><br/>As it can be targeted on all allies, creeps can be targeted in order to render them immune to enemy attacks, particularly towers. Casting Cold Embrace on the creep that is currently being attacked by an enemy tower will waste the tower's attacks for the next 4 seconds, allowing all other allied creeps to continue damaging it.<br/><br/><h4>Winter's Curse</h4>Winter's Curse is an extremely powerful single-target spell that fully disables an enemy and applies a taunt to their nearby allies, causing them to attack the target while simultaneously boosting their attack speed.<br/><br/>The greatest strength of Winter's Curse is that it allows Winter Wyvern to turn the enemy's power against themselves, forcing their farmed hard carries to use their powerful physical damage output against their own team. In particular, enemy auras and powerful damage and attack speed buffs (such as Inner Beast, Bloodlust and Empower) can cause then to connive in their own destruction by turning such abilities into liabilities should they ever clump up.<br/><br/>Winter's Curse will lock down the target through spell immunity and cannot be removed by strong dispels, making it very powerful in many situations. If an enemy carry activates Black King Bar, Winter Wyvern can still disable them and force their allies to attack them, wasting the enemy's spell immunity while dealing damage to them.<br/><br/>Remember that Winter's Curse cannot taunt enemies that are spell immune, so they will not attack their allies if they activate spell immunity prior to Winter's Curse. Depending on the situation, try to lock down the spell immune enemy over adjacent teammates.<br/><br/>Target prioritization is key to using Winter's Curse; try to exploit its long cast range and use it on a key enemy that has powerful teamfight spells or powerful utility items. If possible, try to cast it on a squishy enemy who is standing next to their farmed hard carry, in order to increase the odds of getting a kill (additionally, it can also remove important teamfight spells and items from the field). Even if a kill cannot be secured, delaying a key enemy from participating in a fight for a short duration can make the difference between victory and defeat.<br/><br/>Because of its quite long cooldown, try to avoid wasting Winter's Curse on lone targets. Save it for teamfights where it is most profitably cast, as not having the spell available can give the enemy an edge in engagements where they can fight without worry of being inflicted with the taunt.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that all affected enemies will take no damage from Winter Wyvern or her team for the duration of Winter's Curse, so do not waste spells or attacks attempting to do so. Use Winter's Curse either to secure a kill, or set up the enemy in place while your team re-positions.<br/><br/>Remember that the taunt will still be applied to anything passing through the radius after Winter's Curse is initially cast, whether nearby enemies or the disabled target itself. If the target is facing the right direction, try to use a Force Staff on them in order to push them within proximity of their allies and bring more units within the radius of the taunt.<br/><br/>Many passive abilities do not work against allied units, so do not expect an enemy Phantom Assassin to inflict Coup de Grace strikes on her teammates.<br/>A short summary of the most common effects which do not trigger on allies: Most attack modifiers (critical strike, cleave and all active attack modifiers), Blade Mail, Spiked Carapace, Counter Helix and Corrosive Skin<br/><br/>Short summary of effects which do react on allies: All damage block, all sources of damage negation and reduction, Reactive Armor, Return, Essence Shift, Cloak and Dagger, Headshot<br/><br/><br/>Winter's Curse also can be a good spell for allied heroes to land their spells which benefit by affecting as much enemy as possible, such as Black Hole, Death Ward (especially after upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter), Chakram and Blood Rite. Another mention is Great Cleave from Sven, while it doesn't deal any damage until the duration ends, Sven can use Storm Hammer after the curse duration ends, stunning multiple enemies in the proccess, allowing for easy kill with God's Strength, effectively decimating the entire team (if you manage to catch all team into the curse).<br/><br/>Note though that in the case of spells like Dispersion or Bristleback, the reflected damage or passive quill sprays do not hit allies, but enemies still. The only exception is Centaur Warrunner's Return, which damages allies.<br/><br/>All bashes excluding Spirit Breaker's Greater Bash and Slardar's Bash of the Deep works on allies. Examples: Berserker's Rage, Monkey King Bar, Skull Basher, Time Lock.<br/><br/>Some item attack modifiers also work against allies. Examples: Desolator, Sange and Yasha, Eye of Skadi<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and Healing Salve are useful in the laning stage to deal with harassment.<br/><br/>Clarity provides a way to replenish mana early, important since both of Winter Wyvern's nukes are very expensive in the early game.<br/><br/>Iron Branches are cheap and give a small amount of attributes, and can build into a Magic Wand or Mekansm components.<br/><br/>As a hard support, Winter Wyvern is expected to buy the Animal Courier.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early Game:</b><br/>Magic Stick gives Winter Wyvern burst health and mana regen, which can allow her to survive just long enough to cast one more important spell in a teamfight.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed are a must for all heroes, and will help improve Winter Wyvern's lackluster movement speed. It is particularly useful in order to get in position or chase/escape with Arctic Burn.<br/><br/>Urn of Shadows gives Winter Wyvern additional strength for more health and some mana regen. The active can be used alongside Cold Embrace to heal teammates, or adds yet more damage to her arsenal of nukes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core Items:</b><br/>Town Portal Scroll is crucial to carry at all times, particularly on supports. Auroth's ability to save teammates and turn ganks around makes her a powerful ally to have in any engagement.<br/><br/>Observer Ward is important to purchase regularly as a support, in order to provide map vision. Getting vision on the enemy allows Winter Wyvern to know when and where to rotate to counter their movements.<br/><br/>Magic Wand gives Winter Wyvern additional stats and increased charge storage for a cheap price. 255 health and mana can sometimes be the breaking point that allows her to get her ultimate off against the enemy.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots improves Winter Wyvern's movement speed while giving her a bigger mana pool and a way to replenish both her mana and that of her allies.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a cheap multipurpose item that greatly increases Winter Wyvern's utility. The intelligence and health regen give her more mana and better roaming capability, and the active can help her to position herself more easily for casting her spells, particularly to get Winter's Curse off on an important target. It can also be used to displace allies during Cold Embrace to move them to less dangerous terrain.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Mekansm gives Winter Wyvern more stats and armor, and the active gives her another method with which to heal teammates on top of Cold Embrace.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse greatly improves Auroth's intelligence and provides all-around attributes as well as plenty of mana regeneration to fuel her costly spells. The hex is a powerful hard-disable that greatly increases her ability to contribute to ganks and teamfights.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a cheap but very powerful utility item that gives Winter Wyvern many strong benefits. The intelligence and mana regen greatly improve her ability to cast her spells, and the additional base movement speed makes her more mobile and able to position herself for casting her disables. The active can be cast on herself for temporary invulnerability and debuff removal, or used as an additional disable to take an enemy out of the fight or pin down an enemy during a chase/escape.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight is a strong teamfight item that allows Winter Wyvern to shield her teammates from enemy magic nukes. The magic resistance improves her survivability as well, giving her more leeway to cast spells in the thick of engagements.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a great way to increase Winter Wyvern's mobility and allows her to more easily initiate with her ultimate.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos gives Winter Wyvern a tremendous amount of health and greatly improves her intelligence for more mana and base damage. The active can stack alongside Arctic Burn to greatly slow an enemy from extremely long range.<br/><br/>Glimmer Cape is a cheap but powerful utility support item in Winter Wyvern's hands. It can be cast on herself to allow her to invisibly approach the enemy during initiations, or can be targeted on an ally under the effects of Cold Embrace to fortify their magic resistance on top of nullifying physical damage.<br/><br/>Sentry Ward is important to purchase regularly on top of Observer Ward. Winter Wyvern is very adept at de-warding due to her increased night vision and flying movement from Arctic Burn, both of which allow her to easily check elevated terrain for enemy wards.<br/><br/>Flying Courier should be purchased as early as possible, gold permitting, in order to allow allies to more easily purchase and retrieve items.<br/><br/>Orb of Venom is a situational pickup, as Winter Wyvern is a ranged hero who can only apply a limited slow with the item. However, combined with Arctic Burn, it can increase the amount that an enemy is slowed, sometimes enough to ensure a kill.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is a cheap purchase that increases Winter Wyvern's ability to cast her spells. It provides health regen and a small amount of mana regen, allowing her to roam more independently. The burst mana regen allows Winter Wyvern to cast her spells more readily, and the health cost can be recouped through Cold Embrace.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots is a very cheap boots upgrade that improves Auroth's roaming capabilities. The movement speed boost helps to mitigate her poor base movement, and the armor and passive health regen help to increase her survivability and allows her to reserve Cold Embrace to cast on allies rather than on herself, conserving mana.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage and its upgrade Solar Crest give Winter Wyvern may powerful bonuses for a comparatively cheap price. The armor (as well as evasion with the Talisman of Evasion component) makes her much tankier, allowing her to take advantage of her respectable strength growth, while the scaling mana regen helps keep her mana pool topped up. The active can be cast on a Winter's Curse target, weakening their armor and increasing the odds of killing them.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord gives Winter Wyvern all-around stats and armor, giving her survivability. The active synergizes with her spells, increasing the amount of damage that Arctic Burn and Splinter Blast deal, and can be cast from extremely long range like her spells.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard adds yet another slow to Winter Wyvern's arsenal, while improving her mana pool and survivability. The armor makes her much tankier, allowing her to use Arctic Burn offensively to swoop in while casting the active to apply the aura and damage nuke to multiple enemies. However, its Freezing Aura undesirably slows enemy attacks during a Winter's Curse, the former's radius being slightly larger than the latter's cast range. To mitigate this anti-synergy, this item should be paired with Aether Lens to increase the Winter's Curse cast range and Winter Wyvern should not get close while the spell is in effect.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is an expensive purchase, but drastically increases Winter Wyvern's teamfight contribution. The item provides extremely strong mana regen, ensuring that she will always have the mana to cast what she needs, and having two casts of Winter's Curse at her disposal can secure key kills in major teamfights.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi gives Winter Wyvern stats across the board, making her much tankier and giving her much more mana to cast her spells. The attack modifier can drastically slow an enemy alongside Arctic Burn, allowing her to lock down enemies from extremely long range.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Witch Doctor is a strong support that scales well throughout the game. If well positioned can change the flow of battle with his ultimate.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Ultimate is very damaging with a short cooldown<br/><br/>Maledict is very damaging<br/><br/>Paralyzing cask can stun groups of enemies for long amounts of time<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Dies very easily<br/><br/>Ultimate can be disrupted by stun<br/><br/>Maledict is hard to cast<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><h3>General</h3>Witch Doctor is great with Blink Dagger for fast positioning as allows you to blink in between trees as well on top of cliffs to channel Death Ward safely. Also, it makes up for the short casting range of Maledict.<br/><br/>It can be a good idea to build a Shadow Blade and use it exactly after casting Death Ward. Activating Shadow Blade does not interrupt Death Ward's channeling and makes it harder for the enemy team to interrupt your channeling. However, be cautious about enemies buying Dust of Appearance, Gem of True Sight, Necronomicon, or AoE stuns such as Warlock's Chaotic Offering.<br/>Alternatively you can save gold by simply buying the Shadow Amulet alone. During the 1.5 second fade time you are able to issue any orders without hindering the invisibility from occurring. This is easily achieved with the double tap to cast on self option. When you are ready to place the ward, double tap the hotkey for your amulet, as you are about to fade place the Death Ward. Soon after, you turn invisible while still channeling the spell. It is best to practice this technique with Maledict before attempting in a proper fight.<br/><br/><br/>Consider getting an Orchid Malevolence as it combined with Maledict can bring any damage done to the affected enemy to massive proportions.<br/><br/>The Witch Doctor's early game damage and utility from Paralyzing Cask and Maledict are extremely strong in the laning phase. Consider skipping points in Voodoo Restoration until you reach level 10 to maximize lane pressure and damage output. Having Maledict at maximum level as soon as possible allows you to pull off shorter duration Death Wards to secure important kills.<br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Paralyzing Cask</h4>Paralyzing Cask can be used to continuously stun two heroes with 200 distance to each other.<br/><br/>Paralyzing Cask is most effective when there are just two enemies close together. Under ideal conditions you can stun two enemies for up to 4 seconds each with this ability.<br/><br/>Paralyzing Cask stuns jungle creeps for five seconds, allowing the Witch Doctor to jungle effectively from around level 7 onwards. This is especially useful if you are falling behind or need to speed up a key item such as your Black King Bar or Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/>Paralyzing Cask stuns units in the fog of war, meaning if you use a high enough level Cask on foes nearby jungle camps, there is a good chance it will bounce back to your enemies.<br/><h4>Voodoo Restoration</h4>At level 1, Voodoo Restoration is one of the most efficient AoE heals in the game based on mana-spent-per-hitpoints-gained. It is often a good idea to invest a single point into this ability during early laning and then max it later after your other abilities once you have the mana regen to support the higher cost.<br/><br/>If there is a Rubick on the enemy team, keep in mind that you can cast Voodoo Restoration even while channeling, which prevents him from stealing death ward.<br/><br/>If you plan to pick up an early level in Voodoo Restoration, it is often more effective to buy additional Clarity Potions instead of a set of Tangos or a Healing Salve.<br/><h4>Maledict</h4>Casting Maledict on opponents often immediately forces them to retreat for fear of taking crippling damage while under its effects. You can use this to make enemies flee who would otherwise easily kill you or your allies. If they do not flee, then at best they're trading themselves for you.<br/><br/>Maledict is a very weak and expensive spell at level 1, and its damage only starts to kick in once you get it to at least level 2 or 3. In very early game fights, do not worry about landing a level 1 Maledict unless you're sure you can curse multiple enemies or you have enough burst to follow up.<br/><h4>Death Ward</h4>Casting Death Ward from a hidden position such as the trees, or uphill in the fog, makes it much harder to disrupt.<br/><br/>Try to wait on casting Death Ward in teamfights until the enemies have already used some of their stuns, making it less likely you will be interrupted.<br/><br/>Death Ward is an extremely effective spell against carries that typically rely on Magic Immunity to stay relevant in teamfights, such as Luna, Gyrocopter, Lifestealer, Sven, or Dragon Knight.<br/><br/>Although Death Ward is easily interrupted, it is an effective zoning tool in teamfights that either draw immediate attention from foes with important crowd control spells or forces enemies to retreat from the area which the Death Ward resides in.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting:</b><br/>Tango, Clarity and Healing Salve are all regeneration items such and are strong choices to stay in the lane.<br/><br/>Gauntlets of Strength gives Witch Doctor extra health for survivability, and can later be upgraded to a Bracer.<br/><br/>Animal Courier is a good choice for Witch Doctor as he is a support and is not heavily item-dependent.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early:</b><br/>Magic Stick is a useful health/mana restoring item if the enemies in lane are casting many spells. It can later be built into a Magic Wand.<br/><br/>Boots of Speed give a speed boost, offering better escape and catch-up. They can later be built into Arcane Boots.<br/><br/>Bracer provides extra attributes that can help keep Witch Doctor alive in fights.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Magic Wand is good for burst healing and mana while providing bonus attributes compared to the Magic Stick.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots provides Witch Doctor with an increased mana pool, as well as the ability to supply himself and nearby allies with mana.<br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter allows Death Ward to deal more damage, as well as the ability to bounce between each nearby enemy. This allows for far greater damage output, though it is most effective when you are paired with large initiation stuns such as Tidehunter, Faceless Void, or Enigma. This prevents enemy heroes from breaking Witch Doctor's channeling.<br/><br/>Observer Ward are a good choice for Witch Doctor as he is played primarily as a support. The vision provided by wards has the potential to prevent enemy ganks or catch enemies when they are off guard.<br/><br/>Town Portal Scroll are essential for cross-map transportation. TP scrolls allow Witch Doctor to return to lane quicker after a death, meaning he misses out on less experience in the lane. They can also be used to quickly jump into a fight or defend a tower in a different lane.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational:</b><br/>Medallion of Courage is a cheap item which reduces an enemy target's armor. Since Death Ward deals physical damage, using the Medallion of Courage on a low armor hero greatly increases the damage dealt by your ultimate.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse gives Witch Doctor a large increase to his mana pool, as well as additional attributes and the ability to hex an enemy target. The ability to disable an important enemy target is crucial in the late game.<br/><br/>Black King Bar provided Witch Doctor with an increase to his low health pool, as well as the ability to become magic immune. This prevents most enemies from cancelling your ultimate.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard allows Witch Doctor to slow and deal additional damage in a team fight, as well as provide an increase to his mana pool and armor. It should be noted that the active ability can be used during your ultimate.<br/><br/>Bloodstone allows Witch Doctor to use Voodoo Restoration for much longer. With enough Bloodstone charges, the Bloodstone regenerates more mana than the ability consumes.<br/><br/>Dagon is an effective damage dealing weapon for Witch Doctor if there is an important target that needs to be focused on the enemy team. It also synergizes well with Maledict, applying a large amount of bonus damage if the enemy does not heal immediately afterwards.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is a useful item for Witch Doctor for the same reason as Black King Bar. While it only prevents one single target stun, its cooldown is much shorter and can be used on priority allies to increase their survivability.<br/><br/>Flying Courier can be bought after the 3:00 minute mark. Being a support hero, Witch Doctor should purchase it as soon as possible (assuming no other Flying Couriers have been purchased).<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Playstyle</h3>Zeus is an intelligence based hero played solely as a nuker. He has the highest magical damage output of any hero in the game and his strongest aspect is his early to mid game dominance as well as a extremely strong late game, even with minimal farm. If you play him correctly he can easily win games on his own.<br/><br/><b>Pros</b><br/>Does a massive amount of magic damage<br/><br/>Global Ult<br/><br/>Strong midgame nukes<br/><br/>Easy to play<br/><br/>Can easily snowball<br/><br/><br/><b>Cons</b><br/>Not flexible<br/><br/>Needs mana control<br/><br/>Low mobility<br/><br/>Useless if enemy have Magic Immunity<br/><br/>Bad Attack Animation<br/><h2>Tips & Tactics</h2><br/>Zeus is a great hero. He can dominate lanes, take easy kills, deal massive damage and give vision to your team for easy ganks. He is not very item-dependent but can benefit greatly from them.<br/><br/>Lightning Bolt has a ministun which allows you to cancel channels.<br/><br/>If you ground target Lightning Bolt from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.<br/><br/>If you think someone is just about to escape vision, you don't need to cast Lightning Bolt on the hero, just cast it on the ground right behind them.<br/><br/><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Arc Lightning</h4>In the laning phase Arc Lightning can substitute for your normal attack to get last hits due to its low cooldown and long range, helping you stay out of harm's way given that Zeus's own attack animation, damage and range is rather meager early on.<br/><br/>Arc Lightning is a great tool for tower defense, because it draws aggro from a safe range and deals damage over every unit.<br/><br/>Consider putting two points into Arc Lightning and then maxing your other abilities, as three hits of 85 damage leave the enemy ranged creep just one hero attack away from death, and you don't want to have to go forward to get that lasthit. With two ranks, your second cast will put the creep down to 100 hp, which only very few heroes can deny in a single attack.<br/><h4>Lightning Bolt</h4>Always use Lightning Bolt before Arc Lightning so you may not lose your opponent in the fog.<br/><br/>Always watch your positioning as Zeus and Arc Lightning have relatively long ranges, and Thundergod's Wrath has global range. Often, there is no reason to be up close in battle unless you are chasing down heroes; and Zeus' fragility compounds this.<br/><br/>Remember that Lightning Bolt and Thundergod's Wrath provide True Sight. Do not be afraid to use your ultimate or cast Lightning Bolt where you think they may be if you believe an invisible enemy may be sneaking up on you or attempting to escape; if an enemy is invisible in a team fight make sure to cast Lightning Bolt before casting Thundergod's Wrath so that the granted True Sight allows your ultimate to damage the invisible target.<br/><br/>Because Lightning Bolt offers 4.5 seconds of True Sight and flying vision, you can cast it on the ground near cliff-sides or other popular warding areas to check for wards or de-ward without actually purchasing sentry wards.<br/><h4>Static Field</h4>Leveling Static Field increases your damage output by a great deal and scales very well into the lategame.<br/><br/>During team fights, use all of Zeus's spells (including his ultimate) as soon as possible to make the best use of his passive, that it's based on the percentage of current health, not maximum health, so it will do more damage to heroes at full health. If you wait for the enemy team's health to go down before using Thundergod's Wrath, then Static Field will not do as much damage as it could have.<br/><h4>Thundergod's Wrath</h4>When trying to kill low hp heroes (low, but not low enough for Ultimate only) in hard to navigate areas use Thundergod's Wrath to gain vision of your enemy so you can Lightning Bolt them to death.<br/><br/>Considering the 25% magic resistance most heroes have by default, Thundergod's Wrath effectively deals 168.75/262.5/356.25 damage, provided they have no other source of magic damage reduction.<br/><br/>Thundergod's Wrath can have a good synergy with Bloodseeker's Thirst, since it reveals any heroes that are at low health, so Zeus can simply ulti them to get a kill(s).<br/><br/>Thundergod's Wrath should only be used to acquire a kill if your carry is unable to attain it himself. In most encounters, it should be used early in the fight to make things easier for one's team.<br/><br/>Since magic damage doesn't scale well into late game as physical damage, combining it with allied spells like Soul Catcher, Bloodrage and Ancient Seal keeps him relevant for longer.<br/><h2>Items</h2><b>Starting items:</b><br/>Tango and a Healing Salve are taken for the good HP regeneration.<br/><br/>Three Clarity will make your spells more spammable, since Zeus is very mana dependent.<br/><br/>An Iron Branch and a Circlet will give you more attributes, helping you with survivability and mana management.<br/><br/><br/><b>Early game:</b><br/>Boots of Speed will make you faster, allowing for easier escapes and a better time catching up to enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Bottle allows for lane control and sustainability through runes and crowing. Getting it early helps you to maintain your mana to get last hits consistently.<br/><br/>Null Talisman will give more intelligence, allowing for a larger mana pool and more damage, as well as bonus attributes to help with survivability.<br/><br/><br/><b>Core:</b><br/>Arcane Boots are used to help sustain Zeus' high rate of spell casting and give him the mana pool necessary to remain relevant in longer engagements. It can also be later disassembled to use the energy booster in another item, and eventually upgraded into BoT.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord provides a useful amplification of your magical damage dealt to any enemy caught in its blast. In addition to this, the 6 armor bonus helps mitigate the impact of Zeus' poor base armor, allowing him to survive longer against heavy physical damage lineups.<br/><br/>Aether Lens makes you better at your job by dealing lots of magical damage from as far back as possible.<br/><br/><br/><b>Situational items:</b><br/>Aghanim's Scepter will make your ultimate deal more damage and gives good bonuses to his attributes. If you need to be more tanky and durable Aghanim's Scepter is a better choice than Refresher Orb, since it gives both health and Strength, as well as a boost to other useful attributes.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is used to activate your Thundergod's Wrath twice if you have sufficient mana pool. In late game Refresher Orb is a better item than scepter as it will allow Zeus to use his spells more often, which owing to his scaling passive is more important than stronger ultimate damage. Using your three spells with a scepter in late game will deal less damage than using your three spells, then refreshing them and using them again. Using a Refresher Orb will drain a lot of mana, making you unable to cast your abilities if used carelessly.<br/><br/>Scythe of Vyse helps in many situations, and can be used to make an enemy helpless; it also gives a nice boost to your mana pool.<br/><br/>Bloodstone grants more health and more mana, which are very needed for Zeus. The more kills you do, the more mana regeneration you get.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity is a good utility item: it gives more mana regeneration, a bit more of speed and a good ability to incapacitate enemy Heroes.<br/><br/>Octarine Core is a nice addition to Zeus' inventory as most of his damage output will be from his spells, which means that he will be healed for 25% of all spell and item damage that he inflicts. The lower cooldown of his ultimate will also be appreciated by Zeus players, especially for global scouting. His DPS in teamfights will also raise dramatically, as the lower cooldown on his nukes allow him to trigger his passive more often.<br/><br/><br/>Soul Ring can help with early mana issues, easing jungling and can be used to make a Bloodstone later.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a good choice for mobility and utility, very useful for evading carries and kite magic immune targets. Blink Dagger can also be picked up, Zeus benefiting a lot from mobility items.<br/><br/>Ghost Scepter can be a great choice if you find yourself getting blown up by physical damage. It can also be upgraded into an Ethereal Blade, which can be used to disable the enemy carry, save allies and deal massive amount of burst damage in combination with your spells.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard increase your mana pool enough to cast your combo while offering good enemy control.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos gives you a much needed health boost, catch-up and a possible escape mechanism. The intelligence stats are very cost effective as well.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><br/><br/>
