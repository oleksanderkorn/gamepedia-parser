      "bio": "The Font of Avernus is the source of a family's strength, a crack in primal stones from which vapors of prophetic power have issued for generations. Each newborn of the cavernous House Avernus is bathed in the black mist, and by this baptism they are given an innate connection to the mystic energies of the land. They grow up believing themselves fierce protectors of their lineal traditions, the customs of the realm--but what they really are protecting is the Font itself. And the motives of the mist are unclear.<br/><br/>When the infant Abaddon was bathed in the Font, they say something went awry. In the child's eyes there flared a light of comprehension that startled all present and set the sacerdotes to whispering. He was raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took--to train in war, that in times of need he might lead the family's army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist. He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist.<br/><br/>There was bitterness within the House Avernus--elders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his responsibilities. But all such accusations stopped when Abaddon rode into battle, and they saw how the powers of the mist had given him mastery over life and death beyond those of any lord the House had ever known.",
      "tips": "If you are playing the team's support hero it is usually wise to max Mist Coil and Aphotic Shield first before getting any points in Curse of Avernus as your first two abilities provide a lot of utility early game ranging from healing, to debuff removal, protection and even denying yourself if needed. <br/><br/>Remember that Aphotic Shield can remove stuns and slows from its target, you can use this to save your allies from many certain death situations. <br/><br/>Abaddon is a very durable hero due to his unique ultimate, Borrowed Time, however do not let this fool you into diving enemies where retreating is the better option. <br/><br/>Casting Aphotic Shield upon the same target before its duration has ended will automatically detonate the shield before reapplying another. Combining this tactic with its massive radius can help to increase your DPS in a teamfight or finish off enemies during a chase.<br/><br/>During the early game you can use Aphotic Shield on creeps that are soon to die causing any heroes who move in for the last hit to take damage. With itemization geared toward mana regeneration this can be maintained as harassment in an Abaddon's lane support tactic. Even if the target hero realizes your tactic you can still burst your Shield by attacking the creep yourself. <br/><br/>Due to his ultimate Abaddon is one of the few heroes that can dive towers even in early stages of the game, to add with his ability to chase down heroes you may also want to purchase a Mask of Madness as the extra damage Abaddon takes from activating it will not matter because of Borrowed Time.<br/><br/>Most veteran players will pay attention to when Abaddon's ultimate activates and will not attack until its duration has expired, you can however heal yourself using Mist Coil during this time, or by putting yourself among enemy creeps or damage-over-time abilities that have already been cast such as Jakiro's Macropyre. Pay attention however that your ultimate has a relatively short duration.<br/><br/>Sometimes the best way to deal with Rupture is simply to run. Though Rupture will always outlast a manually triggered Borrowed Time, you still have total control of how much distance you can cover, as well as how much health you stand to lose or gain during Bloodseeker's ultimate.<br/><br/>Since Culling Blade can kill Abaddon even through Borrowed Time you might be able to bait out the ability from an enemy Axe by manually activating your ultimate just before you hit the threshold.<br/><br/>If you are planning on playing the team carry early points in Curse of Avernus will give you much needed chasing power and increased damage output and will also apply the same to your allies. In this case it might be a good choice to max Aphotic Shield before Mist Coil because you are likely to be diving the enemy a lot which will assure that your shield will burst quickly, allowing you to repeatedly cast it on yourself. Though trying to be the carry for the team is not recommended as Abaddon has much more utility as one of the most durable support heroes in the game.<br/><br/>Curse of Avernus can have defensive uses as well, such as hitting an enemy that is chasing your ally to slow them down. You can also use this to save yourself as well under certain circumstances as hitting your target will reduce their movement speed by 20% while give you a 15% movement speed buff. That short boost of movement speed can sometimes save you or your allies.<br/><br/>The on-hit buff and debuff of Curse of Avernus applies to any target that Abaddon may hit, including your own creeps. This means that enemy creeps will gain a speed boost after attacking one of your creeps with you. If you took an early point in Curse, use this to tinker with lane equilibrium during the laning phase.<br/><br/>Note that Curse of Avernus's debuff fully stacks with unique attack modifiers. Considering this you may sometimes want to buy an Orb of Venom or Eye of Skadi which gives a combined movement speed change of 22% for OoV at level 1 Curse and 75% for a Skadi with max Curse. When playing a carry Abaddon this aids you greatly with chasing down heroes. The same can be said with a Sange and a completed Sange and Yasha that gives you both a movement speed boost and an additional slow. <br/><br/>Against less experienced players it may be possible to initiate a team fight with Abaddon by diving into the enemy and absorbing most of their spells and disables since in most cases Abaddon cannot be focused down before his ultimate. This will allow your teammates to enter the fray without the fear of being disabled themselves. This strategy is very unlikely to fool more veteran players.",
      "desc": "Abaddon is one of the strongest magicians in the game with a versatile spectrum of spells at his arsenal. He can support his team not only with protective and healing spells, but also he should be perceived as a serious offensive unit capable of making harm to the enemies, turning the damage they can cause to Abaddon’s team against them. Depending on team’s needs, the multipurpose characteristics of Abaddon&#39;s skill set allow to use him both as a support, and as a carry. Abaddon is often played in a safe lane. When cast, his defensive spells can protect his team from serious damage, while his offensive spells can reinforce damage output of his team. One should take into consideration that Abaddon’s Mist Coil and Aphotic Shield possess rather long duration of cast animations. Another weak side of Abaddon is that his agility is too poor, which makes his armor base and speed of attack very low, despite the fact that he is a strength hero. That’s why he is rather vulnerable to physical damage."

      "bio": "The sacred science of Chymistry was a Darkbrew family tradition, but no Darkbrew had ever shown the kind of creativity, ambition, and recklessness of young Razzil. However, when adulthood came calling he pushed aside the family trade to try his hand at manufacturing gold through Alchemy. In an act of audacity befitting his reputation, Razzil announced he would transmute an entire mountain into gold. Following two decades of research and spending and preparation, he failed spectacularly, quickly finding himself imprisoned for the widespread destruction his experiment wrought. Yet Razzil was never one to take a setback lightly, and sought escape to continue his research. When his new cellmate turned out to be a fierce ogre, he found just the opportunity he needed. After convincing the ogre not to eat him, Razzil set about carefully concocting a tincture for it to drink, made from the moulds and mosses growing in the prison stone work. In a week's time, it seemed ready. When the ogre drank the potion, it flew into an unstoppable berserker rage, destroying the cell bars and exploding through walls and guards alike. They soon found themselves lost somewhere in the forest surrounding the city with a trail of wreckage in their wake and no signs of pursuit. In the tonic's afterglow, the ogre seemed serene, happy, and even eager. Resolving to work together, the pair set off to collect the materials needed to attempt Razzil's Alchemic transmutation once more.",
      "tips": "An early point in Greevil's Greed will significantly increase Alchemist's income.<br/><br/>Smart opponents will make it difficult to land Unstable Concoction by juking and avoiding your vision, causing the backfire. It may be better to use it immediately when an enemy reaches the treeline, even if you lose damage and stun duration.<br/><br/>Fully brewed, Unstable Concoction is one of the most potent stuns in the game, in both damage and stun duration. While the enemy cannot see your timer, they will still be able to see the \"shaking\" animation (Alchemist shaking his vials). It is imperative that you either start channeling within range, or channel a few seconds of the concoction from within fog before revealing yourself. This ability is most devastating to low armor support heroes who almost take its full damage upon impact, especially if they are softened up by acid spray. <br/><br/>Use Acid Spray to dissuade enemies from defending their towers, or pushing into yours.<br/><br/>Feel free to use Chemical Rage for its healing effects; it will even regenerate its own mana cost over the duration, and even more if you have %mp regen from items like Sage's Mask or Perseverance.<br/><br/>Avoid skirmishes if your Chemical Rage is on cooldown, especially in the early/mid-game stage when you have few items.<br/><br/>If you are in a tight spot and nowhere to run with low HP especially without Town Portal Scroll or Boots of Travel, use Unstable Concoction to commit suicide if possible.<br/><br/>Chemical Rage is the strongest single target DPS booster in the game (giving a 70% boost in DPS at level 3). This means that Alchemist scales very strongly with right-click items, however at the same time Alchemist does very little damage without right-click items. This means if Alchemist is going to contribute into team battles down the road, it is imperative to get yourself some right-click.<br/><br/>With Acid Spray it is possible for Alchemist to farm Ancients safely early on. This, combined with Greevil's Greed can (if used efficiently) give Alchemist incredible amounts of gold over time. It is not uncommon to have Radiance or Mjollnir by 14 minutes with this strategy.<br/><br/>Beware! Heroes like Lifestealer, Slardar and Dazzle can remove the little armor you have, making you even more vulnerable and easy to kill. This is especially true in the case of Lifestealer, since Feast helps him break you down.<br/><br/>Though unlisted, Medallion of Courage is a very good item for Alchemist, helping add both armor and mana regen, as well as increasing damage dealt by attacks and spells as well. Build it in place of Ring of Basilius.",
      "desc": "Talking about Alchemist, we should keep in mind that this hero is able to use a number of powerful spells, which may help him not only to survive, but also to be a dangerous rival for his opponents. One of these spells is Unstable Concoction that is believed to be the most powerful stun that is not only distinguished by the time of duration, but which also causes serious damage to the enemies. Whenever Alchemist needs to be healed, there is a good way out – to use Chemical Rage that possesses good healing effect. It also regenerates mana used for its casting. As far as Chemical Rage heals well, it is recommended to have more armour over health, since it empowers his effective hit points. Alchemist can safely farm ancient creeps with the use of Acid Spray. To get more gold, it is advised to combine it with Greevil&#39;s Greed. In the game, there are heroes Alchemist should keep himself away. They are Dazzle, Lifestealer, and Sladar. The most dangerous among them is Lifestealer with his Feast."

      "bio": "Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition, is an image projected from outside time. He springs from the cold, infinite void that both predates the universe and awaits its end. Kaldr is, Kaldr was, Kaldr shall be...and what we perceive, powerful as it appears to us, is but the faintest faded echo of the true, eternal Kaldr. Some believe that as the cosmos ages and approaches its final moments, the brightness and power of Kaldr will also intensify--that the Ancient Apparition will grow younger and stronger as eternity's end draws nigh. His grip of ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a light too terrible to behold. An Apparition no longer!",
      "tips": "Use Cold Feet to harass in the early game, but mind your mana pool.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity in combination with Cold Feet can almost always guarantee a stun (though at the cost of Cold Feet's damage over time). It also allows you to land a short-range Ice Blast in quick succession. <br/><br/>Chilling Touch can be useful to max along with Cold Feet if you are laning with another ranged hero. The harass is extremely potent and can often push your enemies out of the lane. <br/><br/>Ice Vortex can be used to slow enemies when chasing or being chased, as well as reduce their resistance. It also gives vision, so it can be used to scout the Roshan pit, ancients, trees (if someone jukes into them), high ground, and so on. The cast range is very long, so all of this can be done from a safe distance. You can even scout Roshan from the Dire Secret Shop!<br/><br/>Ice Blast is a multi-purpose spell that can be cast to anywhere on the map. Use it to aid your allies in ganks, initiate team battles, finish off low-HP heroes, and clear large creep waves.<br/><br/>Remember that Ice Blast prevents all healing effects from regenerating HP. Landing this spell on the enemy team at the start of a team fight will prevent healers such as Dazzle, Chen and Omniknight or a Mekansm carrying hero from regenerating any hp to their team. The debuff reaches its ideal effect especially if you have an Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/>Ancient Apparition can solo mid in the early game, as he has all the necessary tools to control his lane. AA will look to start ganking as soon as possible and use the early Ice Blasts to his team's advantage.<br/><br/>In spite of his ability to solo, AA is still very potent in a dual or tri lane. Cold Feet functions well as a follow-up to an ally's stun, and Chilling Touch is able to buff every one of AA's allies, effectively multiplying its effectiveness by the number of allies you have available.<br/><br/>All of Ancient Apparition's spells have incredible range. Try to avoid close combat when possible.<br/><br/>You don't have an escape mechanism, so having vision of your opponents is crucial for you to survive. Ask your teammates to ward or do it yourself whenever possible."

      "bio": "The monks of Turstarkuri watched the rugged valleys below their mountain monastery as wave after wave of invaders swept through the lower kingdoms. Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their Unliving Lord's poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth survived--a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God's priesthood. With nothing but a few of Turstarkuri's prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God's magic users--but to put an end to magic altogether.

      "tips": "Blink is the most common choice for your first ability point, as its immediate benefit is better than either of your passives. Put some points into Spell Shield and attributes if you are facing strong opponents or go for Mana Break if you want to be aggressive.<br/><br/>Blink is a very versatile and powerful escape mechanism. You can also use it to chase, maneuver, or to avoid spells during battles.<br/><br/>Manta Style is a commonly built item on Anti-Mage as your illusions can also apply Mana Break, tripling the ability's effectiveness. It also provides an increase to all attributes and a means to remove most disables, especially silences, that could prevent escaping via blink.<br/><br/>Mana Break is most effective against heroes with low mana pools, as you can completely deplete and disable them in less time.<br/><br/>Your laning phase is an absolute nightmare. Many heroes can cripple your early game by harassing you and chasing you away. Also, if you don't utilize your laning phase the game may well end before you reach Anti-Mage's maximum potential. Ask your teammates to babysit you.<br/><br/>Anti-Mage has relatively low base health. If you can't kill an enemy quickly, it may be best to disengage, as a favorable fight can easily result in your own death.<br/><br/>While Spell Shield provides substantial magic resistance, it is not a substitute for magic immunity as it does not block non-damage effects of enemy magic.<br/><br/>Mana Void is very difficult to use to full effect. Constantly check enemies with large mana pools. Use it on enemy casters after they have used their abilities and burnt most of their mana. It can absolutely devastate an enemy team if used properly. Note that it does have a short stun, allowing you to cancel spell casts and channels.<br/><br/>You are utterly useless in team fights if you can't physically attack enemies. There are many ways to counter raw physical damage in DotA, especially if it's melee. Decent players will buy items like Scythe of Vyse, Blade Mail and Ghost Scepter to shut you down. Timing your entrance into the battle is everything for you.<br/><br/>If you find yourself being killed quickly with stun locks and high physical damage, it is a good idea to pick up Vanguard for the HP boost and damage reduction. Alternatively, a Vitality Booster provides most of the benefit and can be later built into a Heart of Tarrasque.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots can be a viable alternative to Battlefury and Treads if your lane has a lot of harass. Rather than needing to go back to base or resorting to jungling, just back off the creep wave (preferably out of los of enemy heroes) and heal to full before you resume last hitting again. This also has the advantage of passively providing you 4 armor under heavy harass, almost a 30% reduction on incoming autoattacks!<br/><br/>A quick Battle Fury will greatly increase your farming ability which will greatly help later in the game. If you do not need a Vanguard, Battlefury is a good alternative.<br/><br/>Never use Blink to start a fight unless you know you can win it. Doing so could leave you stranded in a bad situation.<br/><br/>Although Anti-Mage has the potential to be a carry with his extremely low BAT (Base Attack Time), with his extreme mobility and manaburn in the middle game he can be played as a ganker and semi-carry (mana burn is more effective early as armor and mana pools are lower).<br/><br/>Don't just simply be farming. If the enemy is pushing Anti-Mage can push a different lane solo with a reliable escape mechanism with Blink and TP scroll and can indirectly defend by forcing the enemy to defend.<br/><br/>Be very wary of heroes like Shadow Demon, Dark Seer and Terrorblade, as illusions created from you carry the Mana Break spell as well, and combined with Anti-Mage's high Agility, could easily turn the tides of a teamfight.<br/><br/>Once you get full slotted you could opt to sell your Battle Fury for a different item, but its creep clearing abilities are still very useful and sometimes critical. You should sell it if you absolutely need another item that can turn the tides, such as a Monkey King Bar.<br/><br/>Many players are tempted to switch Power Treads to agility, but given your low strength gain (1.2), it may be better to keep them on strength. This is especially true early game, or if you opt for a Battle Fury instead of a Vanguard.",
      "desc": "When talking about Anti-Mage, we have to concentrate on the spells he can cast in the game. Blink is a very polygonal and potent means by which a hero may escape. It can be also used for maneuvering, chasing, or for avoiding enemy’s spells in a fight. Manta Style is another powerful spell of Anti-Mage. Alone with increasing of all the attributes of the hero, it is also a very good mechanism of removing the majority of disables (e.g. silences), which may not let you escape using Blink. Against enemies, which mana pools are on edge of exhaustion, Anti-Mage can use Mana Break. This spell may totally deplete their mana pools but, on the other side, it means that Mana Void will not cause as much damage as it could have as its volume of damage depends on the maximal size of the mana reservoir. Beware of long-lasting fights! Anti-Mage possesses rather low base health, thus, being engaged in a long fight may cause his death. Therefore, the best way is to kill enemies faster than they could kill you!"

   "arc_warden": {
      "bio": "Before the beginning of all, there existed a presence: a primordial mind, infinite, awesome, and set to inscrutable purpose. As the universe thundered into being, this mind was fragmented and scattered. Two among its greater fragments--who would come to be named Radiant and Dire--found themselves locked in vicious opposition, and began twisting all of creation to serve their conflict.<br/><br/>As war and cataclysm threatened the nascent cosmos, the will of a third fragment made itself known. Naming itself Zet, this intellect sought to resolve the disharmony and return all to perfect unity. Appalled by its kin's conflicting nature, Zet gathered the sum of its power. In a sudden flash, it overwhelmed its siblings, and fused the warring aspects into a stellar sphere before hurling them into the darkness to orbit a nondescript world. Harmony was restored, though only the barest fraction of Zet's strength remained. Setting its gaze on the prison, Zet chose to use its weakened power to serve as watchful warden until time's end. For uncounted aeons, this vigil stood.<br/><br/>Life flourished upon the world below, oblivious to the dangers imprisoned within the softly glowing moon, or of Zet's struggles to contain them. As the captives' eternal clash reverberated within, the surface of the prison shuddered, over time beginning to crack. Ultimately, Zet's depleted power proved insufficient to contain the breach, and at last the moon was shattered. The prison's ancient inhabitants had escaped to sow their conflict anew.<br/><br/>Flung to the farthest reaches by the prison's explosion, Zet was transformed by the dissonant energies of its former captives. No longer of single form and thought, its presence had become split among many--some lesser, some greater--each connected by a fleeting arc of consciousness. Struggling to suppress its own disunity, Zet sped toward the burgeoning conflict of its siblings, bending its fractured wills toward a singular conclusion: the aspects of the primordial mind must be made to reunite, or all must be destroyed lest the conflict spread further...",
      "tips": "Consumables (Healing Salve, Enchanted Mango, Clarity) and Bottle can be used by the Tempest Double. Early game, it can be beneficial to keep at least one such item in the inventory and then use the double's consumables on the main hero after creating it, to negate the health/mana cost.<br/><br/>The same applies to items with charges such as Drum of Endurance and Diffusal Blade. Arc Warden can have potentially unlimited uses of these items if at least 1 charge is kept on the main Arc Warden, then only used it on the Tempest Double. He can also preserve higher duration Black King Bar by not using it on the main hero, so Tempest Double is always created with a higher duration Black King Bar.<br/><br/>Items that place buffs or debuffs can have their duration doubled if timed right, as well as perhaps correcting any mistakes the main Arc Warden has made (such as targeting the wrong unit).<br/><br/>Items that place buffs on allies, such as Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb, can be used on the main Arc Warden for increased protection and then using the main one's own to their allies, or vice versa.<br/><br/>The Double can use teleport items such as Town Portal Scroll or Boots of Travel. This means while the main Arc Warden is somewhere else, farming, pushing or defending, the Double can be on the opposite side of the map contributing to a gank or farm the enemy jungle easily.<br/><br/>The Double's items and abilities are always off cooldown, with Refresher Orb and Tempest Double as the only exceptions. This means items with long cooldowns, like Hand of Midas or Shiva's Guard, can be used immediately by the Double.<br/><br/>Using Hand of Midas with the Double grants the player the gold and 2.5x experience. Due to the double's Midas being always off cooldown upon spawn, it has an effective cooldown of 65/60/55 seconds, compared to the item's actual 100 seconds. This means that Arc Warden gains 190 free gold whenever he creates his Double and uses its Hand of Midas, almost doubling the gold gained through Midas when used whenever Tempest Double is off cooldown.<br/><br/>One Hand of Midas on the hero results in (190/100*60=)114 gold per minute if used whenever it is off cooldown. For the Tempest Double, the gold per minute is (190/65,60,55*60=) 175/190/207 gold per minute, resulting in 289/304/321 gold per minute for the player when both are always used when off cooldown, 2.5/2.66/2.8 times more than other hero besides Lone Druid.<br/><br/>It is wise to use the Double to farm or stack neutral camps if it has nothing else to do with its remaining duration for more efficency and to gain more gold and experience."

   "axe": {
      "bio": "As a grunt in the Army of Red Mist, Mogul Khan set his sights on the rank of Red Mist General. In battle after battle he proved his worth through gory deed. His rise through the ranks was helped by the fact that he never hesitated to decapitate a superior. Through the seven year Campaign of the Thousand Tarns, he distinguished himself in glorious carnage, his star of fame shining ever brighter, while the number of comrades in arms steadily dwindled. On the night of ultimate victory, Axe declared himself the new Red Mist General, and took on the ultimate title of 'Axe.' But his troops now numbered zero. Of course, many had died in battle, but a significant number had also fallen to Axe's blade. Needless to say, most soldiers now shun his leadership. But this matters not a whit to Axe, who knows that a one-man army is by far the best.",
      "tips": "Axe is especially dangerous early game with high starting statistics and the speed from Battle Hunger contributing to his ability to push up to the enemy tower relatively safely, even for a semi-carry.<br/><br/>Berserker's Call provides the full armor bonus at level one. It is the primary factor in his ability to survive physical damage without good statistics.<br/><br/>Resist using Culling Blade when not roaming or teamfighting. While Axe is powerful early game, he levels stat-wise fairly badly, and it is best to drop kills to a carry past the point when a team acquires their ultimate if the speed boost for a killing blow is not immediately necessary.<br/><br/>Items such as the Vanguard, Hood of Defiance and the Shiva's Guard are essential as they help reduce the damage being dealt to Axe while he tanks and initiates a battle without a Blink Dagger. With a Blink Dagger, this aspect can be ignored when initiating to an extent.<br/><br/>During the early phase of the game, a Stout Shield is all Axe needs to survive the lane. If possible, instead of fighting along with allied creeps, Axe can try to go and clash with the enemy creeps by himself with Counter Helix allowing him to take down unstacked creeps by himself.<br/><br/>A more advanced technique used by players is to max out Battle Hunger by Level 7. This enables Axe to constantly deal damage over time (dots) in the lane, dealing crippling damage and blocking any potential to push or counterpush. This meshes well with Axe's capability to tank and keep the enemy at bay while stopping them from last hitting or denying creeps, allowing Battle Hunger deal its full damage.<br/><br/>If Axe is going against two weak melee heroes in a lane without sufficient burst damage (such as Phantom Assassin or Spirit Breaker, etc.), do not hesitate to stand between them and their creeps. It allows for complete lane dominance as they cannot last hit and it denies them of experience and gold as Counter Helix hurts a lot early game.<br/><br/>You can type bind \"P\" \"toggle dota_health_per_vertical_marker 250 325 400 550\" into the console to easily find the instakill health thresholds for Axe's ultimate. Press 'P' in game to change the corresponding number of the health bars. This sets each bar of health to the value you set, which means when they are under 1 bar of health, you can successfully kill the hero. This can also be applied to other spells such as Dagon, Finger of Death, or Laguna Blade, but magic resistance should be factored in. For details on enabling the console, see Console. <br/><br/>Axe is an excellent counter-pick to heroes with abilities that can greatly increase their attack speed (i.e. Ursa, Troll Warlord), as a combination of Berserker's Call and Blade Mail can be devastating to such heroes, especially if Counter Helix procs numerous times.<br/><br/>Instead of using Berserker's Call to draw creep aggro in lane, it's usually better to right click enemy hero (which automatically pulls the creep aggro). It applies to any enemy heroes visible on map, thus you can pull aggro by standing in the middle of wave and right clicking visible enemy on the other side of the map.<br/><br/>Soul Ring can provide all of the mana needed through the early and midgame. Use this in conjunction with a form of HP regeneration such as Tranquil Boots or a Vanguard.<br/><br/>Because of Counter Helix, attacking the enemy's creep wave when it spawns is an effective strategy for Axe to quickly earn experience. This will keep the enemies in your lane suppressed by your creeps during the early game. However it is not recommended if the opponent has an easy way to farm your incoming creep wave.",
      "desc": "Axe is an exceptionally good disabler and initiator. During initiations, the hero can cause lot of physical damage, using simultaneous power of both Counter Helix and Berserker&#39;s Call. The spells allow him to gain massive offensive potential as well as an ability to survive. On the other hand, the hero can be used as a powerful off-lane character and a strong jungler. The use of Berserker’s Call provokes the enemies that stand close to Axe for attack, while armor boost allows him to resist these attacks. No immunity to spells can resist Axe’s Berserker’s Call. For this ability to gain maximum effectiveness, the hero should have a developed mobility skills, since constant jumping just in the center of group of enemies allows Berserker’s Call to reach its utmost. When pursuing fleeing enemies, this ability makes them engage in a fight, thus letting the rest of the team reach them. In addition, Berserker’s Call terminates the Town Portal Scrolls effect as well as taunts invisible enemies."

A force of terror too powerful to be contained by sleep, he surfaced from her slumbers, fed upon her immortality, and stole his vaporous form from her inky blood. He is the essence of fear. Mortals who hear his voice hear their darkest secrets whispered in their ear. He calls to the hidden fear in every Hero's heart. Wakefulness is no protection, for Bane's black blood, continuously dripping, is a tar that traps his enemies in nightmare. In the presence of Bane, every Hero remembers to fear the dark.",
      "tips": "Between levels 6-12 Bane is comparatively a very powerful hero. If you maxed Brain Sap you will be able to solo kill most heroes by means of Fiend's Grip followed by Brain Sap. It is necessary to get kills during this phase of the game; as if Bane is not well-geared and leveled up later in the game, he will be relegated to a support unit.<br/><br/>It is important for the player to judge when to change roles; as mentioned above, Bane should gank constantly in the middle of the game to gain a gold advantage and avoid getting shut down or subjugated to a conservative support role. A well-managed Bane can change the outcome of a team fight in the late game with effective use of items such as Necronomicon, Scythe of Vyse, and Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/>Bane is not an initiator; despite having two disables, he is far too delicate to withstand the initial retaliation. Instead, he should hide until such time as his abilities become crucial when the team fight has ensued(preventing escapes, finishing off enemy heroes with Brain Sap, etc.).<br/><br/>Avoid heroes with stuns, as they can interrupt Fiend's Grip. If you must deal with them, incapacitate them via Nightmare, a Scythe of Vyse, or Fiend's Grip itself. Picking Bane in a match against several heroes with disables is unwise. Black King Bar is typically an effective first major item to build on Bane if you need to help your team disable someone before they retaliate.<br/><br/>If the enemy team lack area-of-effect stuns or interrupts, a Shadow Blade can make your ultimate harder to stop, since your opponents must first reveal you and then interrupt you. As with all similar abilities, you can activate invisibility without breaking your channel. While Shadow Blade is also effective for ganking solo heroes and escaping, you should still get Black King Bar instead if the enemy team have ranged AoE interrupts such as those possessed by Lina, Drow, Dark Seer, or Death Prophet, for example.<br/><br/>Bane is a strong mid-lane character. Enfeeble can severely weaken heroes reliant on physical damage to last hit, while Bane's strong ultimate and nuke allow him to solo almost any hero, while ganking should be no problem. Mid-lane also allows Bane to farm up his core items."

They say the Rider was just a lad cutting chaff in his family's field when he was taken, swept up by a massive morde-bat looking for take-out. But this boy had a better idea, and wriggled his way from his captor's grip, onto the beast's back, and hacked it down with his tools. Emerging from the bloody wreckage and intoxicated by the thrill of flight, the boy realized he'd found his calling. The boy grew, and every summer he'd return to his family's field, often setting out into the bush seeking to reclaim that first thrill of facing death in the form of jaws or a fatal fall. The years went on, but his fire only grew stronger. He studied the overgrowth, plunging deeper with each expedition, until finally he found his way to the caves at the heart of hostility. They say the Rider, on the eve of a scorching summer night, had nothing but a rope, a bottle of liquid courage and a burning determination to feel the skies once more, when he plunged inside..."

Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king's menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks. <br/><br/>Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation. He could, in fact, speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds. The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures. He has grown into a warrior at one with nature's savagery.",
      "tips": "His Wild Axes ability is a powerful farming tool.<br/><br/>Beastmaster can stack/farm ancients incredibly effectively with Wild Axes since it can affect magic immune units. This can be very effectively used in Dire offlane (bottom), as he doesn't need to leave the lane to do so.<br/><br/>Although his abilities have a long range, Blink Dagger is still useful for lining up Primal Roar.<br/><br/>Beastmaster works well alongside carries who already have attack power but lack attack speed (Like Sven and Tiny) due to his attack speed boosting aura.<br/><br/>If you buy Assault Cuirass, it will allow your main carry to focus on raw damage items, as he will already have 65 bonus attack speed from Beastmaster. It will also increase your whole team's survivability and physical damage output.",
      "desc": "In order to facilitate farming for Beastmaster, it is recommended to provide him with Wild Axes. With their help, Beastmaster is able to farm/stack ancient creeps very efficaciously, as Wild Axes can influence even those units that have spell immunity. This feature is preferably to be used in Dire offlane, since this character has no necessity to leave the lane for doing it. No matter that Beastmaster possesses numerous abilities, Blink Dagger is still to be used to help lining up Primal Roar. Beastmaster can be very helpful for those carries (Namely – Tiny or Sven) who possess powerful attacking abilities, but poor attacking speed, as his aura produces an effect of attack speed increasing. When purchasing Assault Cuirass, the main carry can concentrate solely on raw damage items, since he will get an additional 65 points of bonus of attack speed, obtained from Beastmaster. And that in its turn will substantially increase the total team’s abilities to survive and produce physical damage."

The Flayed Ones require oceanic amounts of blood to keep them sated and placated, and would soon drain their mountain empire of its populace if the priests of the high plateaus did not appease them. Strygwyr therefore goes out in search of carnage. The vital energy of any blood he lets, flows immediately to the Twins through the sacred markings on his weapons and armor. Over the years, he has come to embody the energy of a vicious hound; in battle he is savage as a jackal. Beneath the Mask of the Bloodseeker, in the rush of bloody quenching, it is said that you can sometime see the features of the Flayers taking direct possession of their Hound.",
      "tips": "Bloodseeker, whilst being an efficient jungler and dual laner, is also a prime choice for solo mid, as it gives him easy access to the side lanes for ganking.<br/><br/>Reaching level six as quickly as possible should be a priority of the player; ganks should not usually be attempted before he has his ultimate.<br/><br/>Blood Bath gives Bloodseeker significant staying power in lane, healing him whenever he last hits or denies a creep.<br/><br/>An early Quelling Blade will help you get the most benefit out of Blood Bath.<br/><br/>Thirst is especially useful for allowing for clear targets on a team with no map vision or communication. Otherwise, its best for greatly increasing the risk under which weakened enemies move out or providing conditional speed.<br/><br/>Leveling Bloodrage causes it to turn into a steroid with a more powerful attack damage buff on every level, but it also serves as a powerful early game nuke and disable. The steroid effect on a fully-leveled Bloodrage is very powerful, often on par with the full arsenal of buffs carried by a given team.<br/><br/>Bloodrage should be cast on enemies beginning an engagement to prevent nukes. If Bloodseeker is laning against supports it is an extremely useful spell. Late game, it becomes a dedicated steroid for Bloodseeker or other carries or to twitch disable big caster threats such as Enigma or Earthshaker.<br/><br/>At level 3 it can be used almost continuously, since it has a short casting animation.<br/><br/>Rupture is one of the best abilities to intercept an enemy hero that is chasing you or your allies, especially since it goes through magic immunity and does full damage regardless of armor and magic resistance. Heroes with high mobility like Anti-Mage, Lycan, Luna, Queen of Pain or Night Stalker suffer devastating damage when Ruptured as they are chasing or running away.<br/><br/>When ganking it is sometimes best to save your Rupture for when your target begins running away rather than right at the beginning of the gank. You may want to follow up on an allied disable using Bloodrage to silence the target and saving Rupture should the target not die during the initial damage done.<br/><br/>Each individual Meepo will add to the Thirst bonus stack.<br/><br/>Due to the passive Blood Bath being able to heal you upon killing any enemy unit. It is advisable not to spend gold on Morbid Mask, skipping therefore on Lifesteal items. Moreover, Bloodseeker should have a high damage output in order for faster killing, which subsequently gives faster healing.<br/><br/>Skull Basher or Abyssal Blade can opt to be taken if your team lacks disables and your enemies are using Teleportation spells like Town Portal Scrolls to escape your onslaught.<br/><br/>Force Staff, in conjunction with Rupture can cause significant burst damage (120/240/360) to enemy heroes by forcing them to move. It also serves as a quick escape tool, something that Bloodseeker does not naturally possess. However, it should be noted that the burst damage is relatively little to the level of your enemies and the level of your ultimate, and may just potentially push your target to safety.<br/><br/>Helm of the Dominator can introduce interesting new utility if Bloodrage is used as a steroid.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian can be picked up if you are confident in your killing power. It synergizes well with Blood Bath and Bloodrage's damage increase, but can also make you easier to kill, especially when focused.<br/><br/>Rod of Atos can give Bloodseeker even better chasing ability and can be bought if you don't want to rely on Sange's random Maim chance. However, the 25 bonus Intelligence is wasted on Bloodseeker.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can be used to surprise your enemies, especially when they are alone. Backstab damage, movement speed and attack speed boosts your hunting ability along with your Thirst.<br/><br/>Bloodseeker is a very good counter for Slark due to Thirst. You will make him unable to regenerate health from Shadow Dance when his hp is below 50%. Additionally, Bloodrage can be used to silence him to prevent him from escaping. It is also worth noting that Slark cannot use Dark Pact to purge either Rupture or Bloodrage.",
      "desc": "When playing Bloodseeker, one should always keep in mind that he should reach the sixth level as quickly as possible, since before Rupture becomes available, ganks should not be endeavoured. To intercept a foe, which chases you or your friend, one should use Rupture. Rapture causes severe damage to such mobile heroes as Luna, Night Stalker, Anti-Mage, Queen of Pain, or Lycan. Enemy’s carries with Black King Bar are also a good target for casting this spell. When initiating a gank, it is preferably not to use Rupture saving it until your target starts to flee. To astonish an enemy, one may use Shadow Blade. The best effect is achieved when they stay alone. When using Rapture, be very cautious, as some heroes possess abilities that can resist it. One of these heroes is Storm Spirit. The best way to use Rupture against such kind of heroes is to cast this spell when they have no mana at their reservoirs. Otherwise, they just easily escape while you lose your ultimate in vain."

He trained with the greatest aesthetes of the Order, eventually earning, through diligent drunkenness, the right to challenge for the title of Brewmaster, that appellation most honored among the contemplative malt-brewing sect. <br/><br/>As much drinking competition as mortal combat, Mangix for nine days drank and fought the elder master. For nine nights they stumbled and whirled, chugged and struck, until at last the elder warrior collapsed into a drunken stupor, and a new Brewmaster was named.

It is generally leveled up first.<br/><br/>Against extremely strong physical harassment (such as Sniper or Weaver), consider going for a Drunken Haze and Drunken Brawler build to maximize your dodge chance.<br/><br/>Many players opt for Arcane Boots if the hero is being played in a ganking or initiator role, as it can allow you to use Thunder Clap and Primal Split in succession much earlier and solve mana issues.<br/><br/>Use Primal Split sparingly, as it has an extremely long cooldown. Try to avoid using it to run away if at all possible.<br/><br/>If Brewmaster is being played more in the semi-carry role, consider using his ultimate as a life saver to keep yourself in the fight when you would normally die. The utility of the Brewlings works excellently for finishing off opponents as well as initiation. <br/><br/>When playing Brewmaster, try to gain an advantage for your team early before anybody on the enemy carry can build a Black King Bar.

It is also recommended to use Thunder Clap, which is especially powerful at the initial phases of the game. Some players, who prefer to play Brewmaster as a ganker and initiator, take Arcane Boots to let him use Thunder Clap and Primal Split one after another earlier.

For a bit of brew, Bristleback was hired to collect tabs, keep the peace, and break the occasional leg or two (or five, in the case of one unfortunate web-hund).<br/><br/>After indulging in a night of merriment during which bodily harm was meted out in equal parts upon both delinquent patrons and his own liver, Bristleback finally met his match.

      "tips": "Use your passive ability Bristleback to your advantage; anticipate enemy attacks and turn your back on them, so that you can reduce as much damage as you can. <br/><br/>An early ability point on this ability during the laning phase can help you stay in the lane a while longer, especially if you are having trouble against auto-attacks.<br/><br/>Even if your enemies can easily defend against you with a Magic Wand, you can still heavily damage them with Warpath; as long as you're stacking your spells against them, the bonus damage will do its job.<br/><br/>Viscous Nasal Goo is an extremely useful cripple, provided that you keep casting it against your target, as it slows their movement speed for 32/44/56/68%. The cripple's duration is up to you, since you can continuously cast it to refresh the duration, and its cooldown is only 1.5 seconds. However, this ability has a significant backswing, so when you're chasing, be sure to issue a walk or attack command immediately after you see the snot come out.<br/><br/>This ability is very effective when combined with Warlock's Fatal Bonds, as the damage inflicted on the crippled target from other bound creeps or heroes is applied to the armor reduced hero at said reduced value. This makes the Bristleback/Warlock lane combination very potent, even into the late game. When combined with area of effect items and attacks, a lot of damage can be dealt very quickly.<br/><br/>Bristleback's mana woes can easily be remedied by a Sage's Mask or a Ring of Basilius, since his abilities have extremely low mana costs.<br/><br/>One of Bristleback's main weaknesses is his lack of disables, meaning he cannot silence or interrupt an enemy from casting spells. You can either rely on your teammates for disables, or create an item of your own, so long as it benefits him in some way (a good example would be a Scythe of Vyse, since it gives him good mana regeneration for his abilities, and a devastating hex disable).",

The lack of disables makes Bristleback’s skills set incomplete, that is why he finds problems trying to interrupt enemy whenever he decides to cast his spells against you. The only way out is to rely on teammates who possess that ability and could disable the enemy, or to purchase items, such as Scythe of Vyse, which can give him mana regeneration and a destructive hex disable.

Tiring of the intrusions, she paid a visit to Ptholopthales; and when he proved unwilling to discuss a compromise, she wrapped the Vizier in silk and set him aside to be the centerpiece of a special birthday feast. Unfortunately, the absence of the Magnetic Ziggurat's master merely emboldened a new generation of intruders. When one of her newborns was trodden underfoot by a clumsy adventurer, she reached the end of her silken rope.

The regen and movespeed bonus combined with Broodmother's slow is very effective for diving on heroes with no reliable escape or stun.<br/><br/>Broodmother is very effective against solitary targets, but against multiple enemies she suffers; as her lifesteal can generally only replenish the damage taken from a solitary foe.<br/><br/>A quick Yasha will give her more movement speed to evade ganks and remain a threat for that lane. Then this can be made into a Manta Style which will give her a way to remove dust and confuse the enemy to escape ganks and waste their crowd control spells.<br/><br/>Try forgoing the passive for a Desolator and early skill points in attributes instead: your spiders will deal more damage because of that -7 armor, and works on towers as well, and the extra attributes might help you stay ahead of your opponents.

To outsiders, the four-legged clans of Druud are often mistaken for simple, brutish creatures. Their language has no written form; their culture lacks pictographic traditions, structured music, formalized religion. For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self. If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist.

One should not undervalue Return. It is one of the most powerful abilities. Even at initial levels, it can ravage strong heroes with low rates of health and high rates of damage by increasing character’s damage rates against foes, ganking Centaur in the finite period of the game. Due to the long period of cooldown, Stampede&#39;s movement speed boost is recommended to use only occasionally – in some rare cases, when there is a need to help allies flee.

Phantasm provides massive illusions ever, creating an army, which empowers Chaos Knight&#39;s damage up by 400%. Used in combinations, it can make you the deadliest hero in the gameplay."

      "bio": "Born in the godless Hazhadal Barrens, Chen came of age among the outlaw tribes who eked out an existence in the shimmering heat of the desert. Using an ancient form of animal enthrallment, Chen's people husbanded the hardy desert locuthi, a stunted species of burrowing dragon that melted desert sands into tubes of glass where twice-a-year rains collected. Always on the edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each other, Chen's clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong caravan. <br/><br/>In the vicious battle that followed, Chen's clan was outmatched. The armored Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked and died in waves. With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perished-or would have. Defeated, on his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the blade. Moved by Chen's obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword. Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen took to the faith with a ferocity. He joined the Fold and earned his armor one bloody conversion at a time. Now, with the fanaticism of a convert, and with his powers of animal enthrallment at their peak, he seeks out unbelievers and introduces them to their final reward.",
      "tips": "You should try to end the game as soon as possible, because Chen's effectiveness diminishes as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Chen is a good jungler and can take any camp at level 1 if you level Holy Persuasion.<br/><br/>While jungling, don't be too selective about the creeps. Just persuade the higher level ones in the large creep camps and persuade new creeps if yours are on low HP.<br/><br/>Try to keep your creeps group in a Hotkey of some sort (Command groups, tabbing, selecting all other units) and also have another hotkey for both creeps and Chen.<br/><br/>Always try to send in your creeps while keeping Chen at a safe distance (don't send him in the middle of a battle with your creeps) and keep an eye on him and his hp while controlling the creeps.<br/><br/>Always try to keep an eye on the minimap in case you have to use Hand of God to heal a teammate.<br/><br/>Try always to have enough mana to use Hand of God when it isn't on cooldown, as it may be needed at any time. <br/><br/>For jungling, it's useful to have a Satyr Tormentor, as it makes your creeps regenerate HP faster and can use an AoE spell.<br/><br/>For ganking, it's very useful to have at least a Centaur Conqueror/Hellbear Smasher (for the stomp stun/slow) and a Dark Troll Summoner (for the Ensnare so the centaur can get positioned)<br/><br/>You can have guaranteed ganks at level 1 or 2 if you get either a Centaur Conqueror or an Hellbear Smasher and your ally has a stun or a slow.<br/><br/>For pushing, it's very useful to have either Satyr Tormentors (with their nuke they take down creep waves easily), an Wildwing Ripper (its Tornado takes down creeps fast) or even Centaur Conquerors (they are tanky)<br/><br/>For team battles, Centaur Conquerors are the best option, as they can keep the enemy stunned for up to 6 seconds if Chen has gathered more than one.<br/><br/>In team battles, try to use your Mekansm (if you have it) before Hand of God as it gives an armor boost too.<br/><br/>Try to use either Mekansm or Hand of God when all your allies are damaged to maximize the healing, rather than just healing a damaged ally while the rest are with full hp.<br/><br/>You can try to kill Roshan around level 6-7 since your creeps can tank his damage very well and you can instant heal them with your ultimate. However, this is usually not a good idea as Chen is a support and is needed to be in teamfights to heal or, obviously, support his allies. Also, rather give Roshan to your carry instead to give them the much needed gold and experience.<br/><br/>If the game keeps going on until late game (which you should avoid and try to finish the game fast) you should persuade an Alpha Wolf, and make it follow your carry, as it will greatly increase his/her damage dealt.<br/><br/>Be especially wary of Doom, Lifestealer, Enchantress and Clinkz as they can take away your creeps instantly and with the help of a Hand of Midas two of your creeps can be destroyed before they even get near the enemy. Clinkz is a special mention as due to the fact that the creeps Chen persuades have increased HP Clinkz not only gets a huge HP boost from consuming your creeps but also a large damage boost on top of it using his ultimate. The same can be said about Naix if he is not properly locked down as he can use the increased HP of your creeps to not only Infest your creeps to heal himself on the spot but also deal nuke damage back to you and all of your allies present. Doom and Enchantress on the other hand while incapable of healing themselves using your creep can instead use the abilities of your own creeps against you as Doom's Devour ability grants him the abilities of the creep he consumes while Enchantress' enchant simply takes the creep from under your control. <br/><br/>Also be wary if the enemy team has an Ancient Apparition as Ice Blast prevents your ultimate ability from healing the affected units.<br/><br/>Although the lifesteal isn't very useful to Chen, building a Helm of the Dominator will allow you to control an additional creep."

Once a sworn protector of the Hoven lands, Clinkz earned a reputation for his skill with a bow. In the three-hundredth year of the king-mage, the demon Maraxiform rose from sixth hell to lay claim to the forest. In response, the king-mage decreed an unbreakable spell: to any who slew the demon would be granted Life Without End.<br/><br/>Unaware of the spell, Clinkz waded into battle, defending his lands against the demon's fiery onslaught. Clinkz drove Maraxiform back to the gates of sixth-hell itself, where on that fiery threshold the two locked in a mortal conflict. Grievously wounded, the demon let out a blast of hellfire as Clinkz loosed his final arrow. The arrow struck the demon true as hellfire poured out across the land, lighting the black pools and burning Clinkz alive at the instant of the demon's death. Thus, the mage's spell took effect at the very moment of the archer's conflagration, preserving him in this unholy state, leaving him a being of bones and rage, caught in the very act of dying, carrying hell's breath with him on his journey into eternity.",
      "tips": "While he can be an excellent ganker, Clinkz is extremely fragile and puts out huge amounts of DPS, making him a priority target in teamfights. Try to let your teammates start things off while you dance around the edge of the fight dealing damage to distracted or disabled opponents.<br/><br/>You can use orb-walking with Searing Arrows to harass your opponents. Be wary of the moderate mana cost, however.<br/><br/>Use Skeleton Walk a good amount of time before you expect to ambush an enemy, or appear in a fight. This will allow you to use Skeleton Walk again soon after, either for a quick escape or to chase down any survivors.<br/><br/>In most cases, max out Searing Arrows first for the reliable damage increase.<br/><br/>If you are ganking a lot with Clinkz, take Strafe as your second ability to max as the decreased cooldown makes you a great threat. If you are playing as the team's lategame carry, maxing Skeleton Walk will keep you safe and able to move quickly into untaken lanes and the jungle to farm.<br/><br/>Always try to use Death Pact on the biggest creep in the large creep camps, such as the Satyr Tormenter and Centaur Conqueror.<br/><br/>You can deny an enemy jungler some farm by stealing creeps with Death Pact, leaving as little as possible behind so they are forced to clear it for the respawn to trigger. Death Pact may also be used on dominated or controlled neutrals such as those used by Chen or Enchantress to kill them instantly.<br/><br/>Because of the huge amount of physical damage Clinkz can deal over a short period, he is also excellent at killing towers provided something else is there to take the aggro.",
      "desc": "When we speak about Clinkz’s abilities, first of all, we have to admit that he is an impeccable ganker. <br/>Being exceedingly friable, Clinkz is able to inflict massive amounts of damage per second, and that is no wonder he usually becomes the aim number one for enemies in teamfights. Due to his extraordinary abilities to cause tremendous numbers of raw physical damage in a very short period of time, he can be used for destruction of towers as well.To resolve Clinkz’s shortages in mana reservoirs, one has to use the Soul Ring. Just cast it prior to the Death Pact, and it will take 0 HP.<br/> In case, you encounter enemies, which have numerous Ethereal Blades or Ghost Scepters, it is better to purchase Diffusal Blade.<br/> In case, you are going to have much ganking with Clinkz, you should consider acquiring Strafe.<br/>Whenever you encounter a huge groups of creeps, do not hesitate to use Death Pact against the biggest of them.<br/>In order to cause massive damage in the very beginning of the game, you should consider acquiring Desolator."

The son of the son of a clockmaker, Rattletrap was many years apprenticed to that trade before war rode down from the mountains and swept the plains villages free of such innocent vocations. \"Your new trade is battle,\" his dying father told him as the village of their ancestors lay in charred and smoking ruins. <br/><br/>It is a poor tradesman who blames his tools, and Rattletrap was never one to make excuses. After burying his father among the ruins of their village, he set about to transform himself into the greatest tool of warfare that any world had ever seen. He vowed to never again be caught unprepared, instead using his talents to assemble a suit of powered Clockwerk armor to make the knights of other lands look like tin cans by comparison. Now Rattletrap is alive with devices, a small but deadly warrior whose skills at ambush and destruction have risen to near-automated levels of efficiency. An artisan of death, his mechanizations make short work of the unwary, heralding a new dawn in this age of warfare. What time is it? It's Clockwerk time!",
      "tips": "Clockwerk is a formidable ganker with nice farming capabilities who can be effective even with very few items in the early and mid game. This makes you comfortable at almost any lane; side lane, mid lane or solo lane are all viable options.<br/><br/>Clockwerk has great synergy with high DPS nukers. Power Cogs can isolate a single enemy and set them up for AOE or single-target nukes.<br/><br/>Clockwerk has two very powerful escape mechanisms in Power Cogs and Hookshot. Use them to enter fights or escape.<br/><br/>Battery Assault works as a ministun, and is effective for interrupting channeled spells or teleports. This prevents heroes from casting spells with extended cast times.<br/><br/>You can spam Rocket Flare to gain map control due to the vision it provides. Consider using it before the game starts to find out where enemy heroes are.<br/><br/>You can utilize the global cast range of Rocket Flare to kill fleeing opponents.<br/><br/>If a rocket flies over an empty neutral camp exactly during their respawn timer (every 1 minute), it will be counted as blocking (similar to ward blocking) and thus no neutrals will spawn there. However, this requires extremely precise timing, as the rocket needs to be 'physically' present there, not after it explodes.<br/><br/>Clockwerk is a mortal threat to many heroes. However, his spells scale off late game. Be sure to have a strong ganking presence in the mid game to create space for your team.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is also a good item to get on Clockwerk. The damage from the summoned units, mana burn, and the true sight all synergize well with Clockwerk's ability to trap enemies in his cogs.<br/><br/>Force Staff is also a good choice to be able to quickly escape your own cogs, while leaving opponents trapped inside. This is especially useful against heroes that can rapidly deal melee damage (e.g. Slardar, Alchemist, Lifestealer,etc).",
      "desc": "When we talk about Clockwerk, the first thing we have to know is that this is an impressive ganker and initiator. He is not the one, who needs a vast number of items to be effective. His complete set of nukes and disables let him take control of the crowd in all possible situations, since his ability to disrupt foes is really a formidable weapon. Clockwerk’s base agility is rather poor, nevertheless, he compensate it with stunning base strength and ability of strength growth. Direct physical damage can cause him a lot of troubles, that is why he needs to possess on the regular basis those items, which could add him some armour protection. As a rule, Clockwerk is used as an off-laner. Battery Assault is a spell that can be successfully used by Clockwerk against lone targets. It has a stun effect and is good for interrupting channeled spells. This spell is better used when a target has less movement speed than Clockwerk. Thus, he can surely slow him down, giving allies time to come nearer."

      "bio": "Born in a temperate realm, raised with her fiery older sister Lina, Rylai the Crystal Maiden soon found that her innate elemental affinity to ice created trouble for all those around her. Wellsprings and mountain rivers froze in moments if she stopped to rest nearby; ripening crops were bitten by frost, and fruiting orchards turned to mazes of ice and came crashing down, spoiled. When their exasperated parents packed Lina off to the equator, Rylai found herself banished to the cold northern realm of Icewrack, where she was taken in by an Ice Wizard who had carved himself a hermitage at the crown of the Blueheart Glacier. After long study, the wizard pronounced her ready for solitary practice and left her to take his place, descending into the glacier to hibernate for a thousand years. Her mastery of the Frozen Arts has only deepened since that time, and now her skills are unmatched.",
      "tips": "Crystal Nova is a large area of effect nuke that also slows your enemies. You can hit enemies from 1100 units away with it (700 casting range + 400 radius).<br/><br/> Frostbite is a great disable which prevents the target from moving or attacking. It also interrupts channelling spells and teleports. Unfortunately, it does not prevent enemy heroes from casting spells (except for True blinks).<br/><br/> Arcane Aura benefits the whole team greatly, especially one with a strong caster/ganker line-up, as it grants them a better lane presence due to the increased number of spells they can use.<br/><br/>Generally, 3 points in Arcane Aura, with 2 levels taken early, are sufficient for most of the game. Adjust your ability build to the needs of your team.<br/><br/>This bonus is doubled on Rylai herself, granting a whopping +5 bonus mana/second at level 4.<br/><br/> Freezing Field is an incredibly strong spell. However, it can be unpredictable and usually gets interrupted by your enemies very quickly. Freezing Field consumes a lot of mana, so use it sparingly.<br/><br/>Many players choose not to level Freezing Field until quite late in the game, as it is a situational spell that is most effective in large clashes; and its use consumes a huge amount of mana. However, its slow and gigantic (if unpredictable) damage can be very useful in early game, especially against enemies that lack the means to interrupt it. Let your decision be informed by enemy line-up as well as laning composition.<br/><br/>Crystal Maiden's potent spells grant her an incredible early-game roaming and ganking presence, particularly when her slow movement speed is offset with Tranquil Boots.<br/><br/>Frostbite's 10 second duration on creeps can be used to earn Crystal Maiden some spending cash in the jungle, either during roams or while her carry's lane is uncontested.<br/><br/>Observer Wards and Sentry Wards should be bought over and over again to provide map control throughout the match.<br/><br/>Later on, Crystal Nova may be used to help push a lane without contesting carries for last hits, as the damage is not quite enough to kill a wave of creeps. However, make sure to keep it off cooldown in the possibility of an upcoming teamfight.<br/><br/>In teamfights, cast Crystal Nova early to reduce incoming damage due to the attack speed slow.<br/><br/>If you have a few coins to spare, buy items that boost your survivability, or get yourself an escape/positioning mechanism such as Blink Dagger or Force Staff.<br/><br/>Freezing Field must be used at the right time to avoid interruption and being focused. Generally speaking, in an encounter it is best used after the initial nuking phase; when the enemy's stuns are on cooldown (building a Black King Bar will provide immunity to stuns; but Crystal Maiden does not typically get much gold and this can be very difficult to build in a game where your team is not getting a lot of kills). If your team has an initiator with the capability to disable a group of enemies, such as Tidehunter or Enigma, Freezing Field should be used in synchronization with their mass disable. Using Freezing Field very often results in Rylai's death, and she rarely is able to channel it for its full duration, but if she can maintain it even for a few seconds it will be useful for her team.<br/><br/>Although Freezing Field's damage can be upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, to do so is to gild the lily; Freezing Field at level 3 is staggeringly powerful even without a scepter and it's wiser to build items that improve her chances of channeling it."

Hailing from a place he calls 'The Land behind the wall,' Dark Seer remains an outsider here-a warrior from a realm beyond the veil of this reality. <br/><br/>Once a great general among his people, and a valiant defender of the god-king Damathryx, Dark Seer's army was wiped out by a much larger force in the final days of the Great Boundaries War. Facing certain defeat, he made one last desperate act: he led the enemy forces into the maze between the walls. At the last moment, just before capture, he crossed over-then sealed the walls forever in an explosive release of dark energy. When the dust settled, he saw that he had saved his people but found himself blinking at the sun of a different world, with no way to return. Now he is committed to proving his worth as a military strategist, and vows to show that he's the greatest tactician this strange new world has ever seen.",
      "tips": "With a Stout Shield and healing items, Dark Seer can go to kill neutral creeps almost immediately.<br/><br/>An advanced jungling tactic involves Smoke of Deceit. By combining it with Ion Shell, Dark Seer can jungle without taking any damage from creeps, as the only thing that removes the invisibility is proximity to an enemy hero or auto attacking a unit. In this way, Dark Seer can stack a single camp multiple times, cast Ion Shell on himself, pop Smoke, and stand at the camp until the creeps have been killed. Because of the steep cost of Smoke, it is advised that players do not use it without stacking camps first. As of the July 26th patch neutrals will now run away when attacked by an invisible enemy, players can still choose to use this method of jungling by chasing the creeps while invisible or casting on a weak neutral but the method will be far less efficient compared to before.<br/><br/>If laning, be sure to harass enemies with Ion Shell by placing it on their melee creeps (for melee heroes) or ranged creeps (for ranged heroes). Additionally, placing Ion Shell on the second allied melee creep to arrive at the creep line is a good way to push the lane as well as create a moving damage-dealing creep that will chase enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Be sure to take at least 1 early point of Surge, as it can help escaping ganks and chasing, as well as giving more mobility.<br/><br/>When chasing, self-cast Ion Shell and run next to the enemy without attacking, using Surge if you need to catch up. Even better, use surge to body-block enemy heroes (that is, get in front of them to hinder their movement) and deliver auto-attacks without moving out of range of the Ion Shell.<br/><br/>Wall of Replica is usually leveled after you've maxed both Ion Shell and Vacuum, as early game illusions don't deal much damage. Additionally, the relatively high mana cost at lower levels can be prohibitive, as you won't be left with much mana to cast other spells.<br/><br/>AoE spells, especially those that require positioning, greatly benefit from Vacuum, as you can place all of them together to ensure a hit.<br/><br/>Using Vacuum on enemy heroes to send them through your Wall of Replica will disallow foes from preventing illusions, as well as causing guaranteed damage from passing through the Wall.<br/><br/>Due to Vacuum and Ion Shell's instant cast, your usefulness in large team fights permit Dark Seer to synergize extremely well with heroes such as Enigma and Jakiro. Make sure to cast these abilities with Black Hole and Ice Path/Macropyre/Liquid Fire to maximize AoE damage and maybe turn the tide in battle.<br/><br/>Mekansm is a strong pickup on Dark Seer, as it makes him tankier and he can very quickly farm one up.<br/><br/>A Bottle can also be used to sustain high mana use, if the Dark Seer is put midlane. It has the added benefit of rune control as most runes are useful for Ion Shell harass."

Others return with strange aptitudes. But all who go there are changed by their experiences. Driven by the need for enlightenment, Dazzle was the youngest of his tribe ever to request the sacred ritual. At first the order refused him, saying he was too young. But Dazzle was not to be dissuaded. Sensing something special in the headstrong young acolyte, the elders relented. Dazzle drank down the sacred potion and sat by the fire while the rest of his tribe danced through the night. In this ethereal dimension of the Nothl Realm, the properties of light and dark are inverted. Thus his brilliant healing light, beautiful to our eye, is actually a sinister kind of evil; and the darkest deeds are done in a dazzling glow. The elders' intuition was prophetic: Dazzle returned to his people as a Shadow Priest like none seen before, with the power to heal as well as to destroy. Now he uses his gift to cut down his enemies and mend his friends.",
      "tips": "Don't forget that Shadow Wave deals damage around your healed allies as well, roughly a Melee hero swing and a tiny bit more.<br/><br/>Each level of upgrade for Shallow Grave makes it cost less mana; if you're having mana problems (and you likely will), consider upgrading it sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>Your first skill can be any of the three depending on the situation; Poison Touch if you're hunting for first blood (with teammates, by yourself or with a single lane partner is probably not enough and can be risky in the event of a reversal), Shallow Grave if the enemy has not been spotted in their lanes and you suspect a possible gank incoming, and Shadow Wave if you're fighting an aggressive melee gank with an ally. <br/><br/>Don't forget that the range of Shallow Grave increases with each level; it starts out less than your normal attack, but at level 4 goes to twice that length. You don't want to have an ally die just because you had to run in closer.<br/><br/>Using Shallow Grave is one of the most important things Dazzle does. Gauge the situation to time it right, keeping an idea of which spells have already been used yet can prevent you from using Shallow Grave too early or too late. In a teamfight, try to prioritize your targets: your team's main carry, allies that haven't used their ultimate yet, or heroes that can change the tide of battle. In the early game laning phase, you can aggressively attempt a kill and then use Grave on yourself once you're near death; however, this can easily backfire due to burst damage and stun, preventing you from using the spell.<br/><br/>While Weave is a spell with a fairly simple effect it can massively increase both the deadliness and the durability of your team, especially if it is heavy in physical damage dealers who need to close with the enemy like Ursa and Sven.<br/><br/>Learn to use Weave pre-emptively to maximise the armor buff/debuff for the team fight. In addition, it can be used to discourage your enemies from sieging a tower or attempting Roshan: as their armor deteriorates while they make an attempt, their chances of following up with a team fight in their favour becomes much lower.<br/><br/>One of the main advantages of Shadow Wave is that, being a healing spell that can deal big damage in one time only if the situation is right (similarly to Earthshaker's Echo Slam), most enemies won't expect you to be a threat to them, and will chase you carelessly in a straight line. Decrease their armor with Weave or Medallion of Courage, then lead them into a wave of allied creeps. Once they're surrounded by the creeps, Shadow Wave them. Your attacker's diminished armor will not stop the raw physical damage. Then either slow him and chase after him, making sure your creeps stand around him for more Shadow Wave damage, or face him and Shallow Grave yourself if the enemy's damage output is too high for you to handle.<br/><br/>Unlike in Dota 1, the buff from Weave can be stacked with Refresher Orb. If cast simultaneously it will change armor by 2 every second. Alternatively, the prospect of a double Shallow Grave will prove to be gamebreaking in ganks and teamfights in keeping team-mates alive."

But after years of inquiring on behalf of others, she began to seek clues on her own fate. When death refused to yield its secrets, she tried to buy them with her life. But the ultimate price proved insufficient. Death disgorged her again and again, always holding back its deepest mysteries. Her jealousy grew. Others could die for eternity--why not she? Why must she alone be cast back on the shores of life with such tiresome regularity? Why was she not worthy of the one thing all other living creatures took for granted? Still, she would not be discouraged. Each time she returned from the grave, she brought a bit of death back with her. Wraiths followed her like fragments of her shattered soul; her blood grew thin and ectoplasmic; the feasting creatures of twilight took her for their kin.. She gave a little of her life with every demise, and it began to seem as if her end was in sight. With her dedication to death redoubled, and no client other than herself, Krobelus threw herself ever more fervently into death's abyss, intent on fulfilling the one prophecy that eluded her: That someday the Death Prophet would return from death no more.",
      "tips": "Exorcism is a fantastic pushing ultimate that can easily take down towers and roshan if left unhindered. Fighting into an activated Exorcism is quite dangerous as well, which means hindering her is not easy.<br/><br/>Crypt Swarm is typically maxed first as it is a very strong AoE nuke with low cooldown, followed by Witchcraft, which greatly reduces the mana cost of Crypt Swarm as well as alleviating Krobelus' very low base movement speed. Maxing Witchcraft early also enhances Exorcism, which is a useful ability at all stages of the game.<br/><br/>Consider holding off on the fourth point in Crypt Swarm in favor of the final points in Witchcraft. It's slightly more efficient, both as damage per second and damage per mana, not to mention the additional bonuses given by Witchcraft.<br/><br/>Put a single point in Silence early, as 3 seconds of silence is well worth the 80 mana it will cost you.<br/><br/>Always remember Exorcism's damage is physical, and as such Armor reduction increases its damage. Focusing on targets with low armour (Int and many Str heroes) will yield the best result of Exorcism. That said, its damage is a threat even to targets with very high armour.<br/><br/>In a large clash, Krobelus should be swooping around silencing and nuking enemy supports while eroding their health with Exorcism. Carries almost unfailingly have higher armor than supports, and since Exorcism is physical damage, her damage potential is highest when she focuses on the supports.<br/><br/>Despite her abysmal base movement speed, with Witchcraft and Phase Boots Krobelus moves extremely fast and can often avoid damage simply by being faster than her aggressor. A Eul's Scepter of Divinity is also common pickup on her and will increase her movement speed to phenomenal levels. Krobelus tends to chase people around a lot with Exorcism, so high movement speed is a must and can also help the spirits damage enemies around Krobelus while she is safe.<br/><br/>Use Exorcism as early as is practically possible for clashes, as the sooner it is cast the sooner her spirits will return and heal her. Her spirits will easily harvest enough life to restore her HP entirely, and the conclusion of her ultimate can save Krobelus' life; as well as severely endanger the lives of her adversaries as she returns to battle with full health.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage makes Exorcism do a lot more damage to a single target, as well as provide more mana regeneration and armor when not active, both of which Death Prophet needs.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass is fairly easy for Death Prophet to farm because of Crypt Swarm being a fast farming tool, and her ability to take towers in seconds with Exorcism. Assault Cuirass gives a lot of armor and attack speed to herself and her team, as well as reducing the enemy's armor, allowing Exorcism to do even more damage in engagements and pushes."

They are the fractured remnant of a once-great civilization, a fallen tribe, their stormcraft strange and inscrutable, cobbled together from scraps of lost knowledge which even they no longer fully understand. For those on the high plain, weather has become a kind of religion, worshiped as both the giver and taker of life. But the electrical storms that bring life-sustaining rains arrive at a cost, and many are the charred and smoking corpses left in their wake. <br/><br/>Although small for his kind, Disruptor is fearless, and driven by an insatiable curiosity. As a youth, while still unblooded and without a stryder, he explored the ruins of the ancestral cities--searching through collapsed and long-moldering libraries, rummaging through rusting manufactories. He took what he needed and returned to his tribe. Adapting a coil of ancient design, he harnessed the power of electrical differential and now calls down the thunder whenever he wishes.

      "tips": "The vision granted on Thunder Strike's target is great for negating jukes, and at later levels Glimpse can ensure an enemy cannot escape.<br/><br/>If you see an enemy teleporting to a tower, Glimpse can send them right back where they started. This can be crucial to cut off reinforcements when tower-diving.<br/><br/>Kinetic Field's formation time is significant, so try and combine it with allied disables to ensure capture.<br/><br/>A mark will indicate where a Glimpsed target will return, so you can cast Kinetic Field around the mark to ensure capture.<br/><br/>If you can trap 3 or more enemies inside a Kinetic Field/Static Storm combo you will shift the tide of battle greatly in your team's favor as the enemies will be left without their arsenal of spells and will take significant damage over time. This is usually better achieved as a follow up to another initiation such as Magnus's Reverse Polarity. <br/><br/>Due to its low starting damage, Static Storm will also benefit from an allied initiation before placement.<br/><br/>Static Storm can act as an instant silence thanks to Disruptor's miniscule castpoint. Use it to interrupt channeling abilities.<br/><br/>It is better to cast Static Storm first before Kinetic Field or at the same time to ensure that enemy heroes will stay in the Storm the longest amount of duration possible. By casting Kinetic Field just before enemy heroes are about to try and leave the AOE, the duration of Static Storm is maximized."

Six and sixty times his wings were branded, until only smoking stumps remained. Without wings, he slipped loose from the tethers that bound him within the light and he fell screaming to earth. A crater in the desert, Paradise lost. Now he attacks without mercy, without motive, the only living being able to move freely between the seven dark dominions. Lashed by inescapable needs, twisted by unimaginable talents, Doom carries his own hell with him wherever he goes. Defiant to the last. Eventually, the world will belong to Doom.",
      "tips": "Doom has very poor Agility gain and one of the lowest starting armor in the game so it is essential to tank him up with armor items such as Assault Cuirass and Shiva's Guard to make his high HP go farther against physical attacks.<br/><br/>Be aware of heroes that commonly build Linken's Sphere as casting Doom on them will result in it being completely wasted. Cast LVL? Death on them first to burn the Linken's Sphere cooldown before casting Doom.<br/><br/>Always make sure to never max out LVL? Death, but instead level it when your enemies are in multiples of 6,5,4, and 3 in order to make it hit as hard as possible.<br/><br/>Cast Doom early in teamfights - the huge 15 second duration can render spell-dependent nukers such as Zeus or Lina virtually useless. Alternatively, if you can catch a hero carrying key support items like Mekansm and Pipe of Insight you can prevent those items from being used during the subsequent fight.<br/><br/>Make use of Devour's ability steal to give yourself and your team useful neutral creep abilities like stuns, slows, ensnares, or different types of auras.<br/><br/>Dark Troll Summoner is one of the best creeps to devour for a jungling Doom in early game. It gives Raise Dead, allowing you to summon two skeleton warriors who can tank creeps for you.<br/><br/>Another useful creep for jungling is Satyr Tormenter, its Unholy Aura provides great health regeneration (4 health/second), and can also be used while laning to help you and allies hold lane longer. The Shockwave nuke has a high mana cost, but has good range and moderate cooldown, which you can use to finish off fleeing enemies with low health. In the early stages of the game, it can also be used to effectively harass your opponents in-lane.<br/><br/>Hill Troll Priest's heal and mana regeneration aura are good for laning as well. The low mana cost healing spell can be useful against heroes who deal damage over time like Venomancer, Viper, or Axe, and is particularly useful against Silencers Curse of the Silent.<br/><br/>In midgame, you may opt for more powerful spells such as War Stomp (from Centaur Conqueror), or Ensnare (Dark Troll Summoner). A Satyr Trickster gives you a Purge spell on a very low (5 seconds) cooldown, it is a very versatile ability and is another strong choice. Remember that it has very short cast range of 200, only a little over melee range.<br/><br/>In lategame, one of the best options is an Alpha Wolf with passive critical hit chance (20% for 2x damage) and 30% bonus damage aura.<br/><br/>A Kobold Foreman's movement speed aura can also be useful for pushing, ganking, chasing and fleeing.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is a very strong item on Doom, since Scorched Earth will heal your summons as well. The item also gives Doom valuable intelligence.<br/><br/>Unlike other melee heroes, Doom has 150 attack range (while the normal melee hero has 128 attack range)",
      "desc": "Doom is a many-sided warrior, who is preferably played as a safe lane carry. In the late period of the game, he may become a very serious threat to all of his enemies through his smashing nukes and ultimate, making his disables last for more than 15 seconds. Being a versatile carry, he allows one to develop his skills in several different ways.<br/> The weakest point of Doom is his minimum armour base, as well as poor agility. That makes him very sensitive to physical damage. That is why he has to be equipped with items, which increase armour, just to stay alive in fierce teamfights. He also needs items that boost attack speed, for him to make any damage to his foes. The volume of his mana pool is insufficient, thus, it will be a real help for him when he is supplied with some items that increase it.<br/>On the other hand, Doom is an outstanding farmer. He can easily get the gold to let himself buy powerful core items that could compensate his weak sides. This ability is a key to his versatility."

Seeing no honor to be gained in dragon-murder, Knight Davion prepared to turn away and leave his old foe to die in peace. But a voice crept into his thoughts, and Slyrak gave a whispered plea that Davion might honor him with death in combat. Davion agreed, and found himself rewarded beyond expectation for his act of mercy: As he sank his blade in Slyrak's breast, the dragon pierced Davion's throat with a talon. As their blood mingled, Slyrak sent his power out along the Blood Route, sending all its strength and centuries of wisdom to the knight. The dragon's death sealed their bond and Dragon Knight was born. The ancient power slumbers in the Dragon Knight Davion, waking when he calls it. Or perhaps it is the Dragon that calls the Knight...",

Some players even choose to take Attribute Bonus over further levels in it.<br/><br/>Many guides recommend not levelling Elder Dragon Form at lvl 11, but those guides are outdated. Prior to version 6.78, the Red Dragon did not carry over the corrosive effect from the Green Dragon, which made it inferior at pushing down towers. Due to the recent patch, it is no longer necessary to skip levelling the ultimate at lvl 11. <br/><br/>Soul Ring is a useful item on Dragon Knight, as it allows him to farm using Breathe Fire constantly, and the extra regeneration from Soul Ring and Dragon Blood offsets the health loss."

      "bio": "Drow Ranger's given name is Traxex-a name well suited to the short, trollish, rather repulsive Drow people. But Traxex herself is not a Drow. Her parents were travelers in a caravan set upon by bandits, whose noisy slaughter of innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow people. After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child hiding in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned. Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself as ugly. After all, her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers. Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could approach. Lithe and stealthy, icy hot, she moves like mist in silence. That whispering you hear is her frozen arrows finding an enemy's heart.",
      "tips": "Manually casting Frost Arrows (known as orbwalking) will prevent Traxex from drawing creep/tower aggro. Traxex can also use this to kite and escape from enemies when caught out. <br/><br/>An early level of Gust can be crucial to defend against spellcasters.<br/><br/>Due to the mechanics of Marksmanship, positioning is the key for Traxex. Traxex needs to be at least 400 units away from enemies to enable Marksmanship, or else it won't be active and won't give Traxex the ever needed bonus agility. <br/><br/>Marksmanship will have a noticeable particle effect that emanates from Traxex's body. If Traxex is too close to an enemy hero, the particle effect will disappear, meaning Traxex will not receive the bonus Agility. This also occurs when invisible units are nearby. <br/><br/>If during a team fight the enemy heroes get close to each other, using Gust in many or even all of them can simply turn the battle aside. This can make Traxex not just a great carry, but also a powerful disabler/initiator too. <br/><br/>When in possession of Shadow Blade, Traxex can effectively gank by taking a shot to break the invisibility and immediately using Gust, leaving the target: slowed, damaged, silenced, and being completely unable to react (apart from using items).<br/><br/>Because of the removal of the bonus agility when there is an enemy hero near Traxex, it is advised to avoid picking her when the enemy carries are especially mobile (Antimage, Faceless Void) or otherwise employ powerful slows that can match Frost Arrow (Viper, Phantom Assassin)."

But his spirit is still that of the earth; he carries its power in the magical totem that never leaves him. And on the day he returns to dust, the earth will greet him as a prodigal son.",
      "tips": "Fissure creates an impassable barrier, which can be effective for stopping enemies from escaping.<br/><br/>It is important to keep in mind, however, that this barrier is also impassible to yourself and allies. Be careful of how you position yourself and the Fissure wall.<br/><br/>Use Enchant Totem in conjunction with Aftershock to stop escaping enemies, even when Fissure is unavailable.<br/><br/>Upon initiating, Aftershock allows for your Enchant Totem and Echo slam to disable the enemy team for longer periods of time.<br/><br/>Because of the echo damage, Echo Slam is best used in the middle of the enemy team, especially when they have a large amount of units near them.<br/><br/>A Blink Dagger or Force Staff will help you get into position to use Echo Slam. Note that it might not always be best to initiate and it can sometimes be best to wait for the enemy team to start the fight and group up.<br/><br/>Try to find a balance between building items that help you be the team's initiator and those which increase your mana, Intelligence and or Strength so that you can remain effective throughout the game.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is often a particularly effective item on Earthshaker, as it provides both health and mana regeneration while giving you the option for mana whenever needed.<br/><br/>Arcane Boots give Earthshaker more team utility through active mana regeneration, increased movement speed, and an increased mana pool to allow you to cast more spells.<br/><br/>Because of Echo Slam, it is a fatal mistake to push against an Earthshaker without taking precautions to not get caught while grouped up. Echo Slam's damage has no upper limit and so Earthshaker has the potential to wipe out an entire team of heroes instantly if there are enough bodies present.<br/><br/>Because of Echo Slam, Earthshaker is particularly effective against heroes that can create illusions or clones, such as Chaos Knight, Naga Siren, Phantom Lancer and Meepo, as well as heroes that can summon or control units such as Broodmother, Nature's Prophet, Enchantress and Chen."

   "elder_titan": {
      "bio": "Well may you ask, \"How did this world take its form?\" Why of all the worlds in creation, has this one its strange properties, its diverse and motley collection of creatures, cultures and lore? \"The answer,\" One whispers, \"lies with the Titans.\"<br/><br/>These original progenitors were there near the Beginning--if not actual witnesses to the creation, then born with it still echoing in their ears. Stamped with the earliest energies of the universe, they wished nothing more than to continue as creators themselves. Thus they bent to the task of shaping matter to their will: hammering and heating, bending and blasting. And when matter proved less challenging than they liked, they turned their tools upon themselves, reshaping their minds and reforging their spirits until they had become beings of great endurance. Reality itself became the ultimate object of their smithing. Yet, along the way, they sometimes erred. In cases of great ambition, mistakes are unavoidable.<br/><br/>The one we know as the Elder Titan was a great innovator, one who studied at the forge of creation. In honing his skills, he shattered something that could never be repaired, only thrown aside. He fell into his own broken world, a shattered soul himself. There he dwelt among the jagged shards and fissured planes, along with other lost fragments that had sifted down through the cracks in the early universe. And this is why the world we know resembles an isle of castaways, survivors of a wreck now long forgotten. Forgotten, that is, by all but the One who blames himself. He spends his time forever seeking a way to accomplish the repairs, that he might rejoin the parts of his broken soul, that we and the world alike might all be mended. This is the One we know as Elder Titan. ",
      "tips": "Depending on your team composition and level of play, Elder Titan's skills have differing priorities to max. Level Echo Stomp to increase the sleep's duration, making it easier for Elder Titan and his team to set up their own area-of-effect spells without disturbance. Astral Spirit provides the highest overall damage increase. Maxing Natural Order early massively increases its effectiveness, as enemy heroes will have little to no bonus defenses and will thus be taking almost full damage.<br/><br/>Astral Spirit spawns at a target location up to a distance of 1200 away from Elder Titan and can then be moved further away from there. Elder Titan can use this to initiate by casting Astral Spirit in the middle of an enemy team followed immediately by Echo Stomp; if the enemy team was unaware of Elder Titan's location beforehand they usually won't have time to react before Echo Stomp's cast time is finished. If Echo Stomp's level is high enough the enemies should be stunned for the entire 3 seconds it takes for Earth Splitter to form and activate, assuming they don't take any damage that breaks the stun.<br/><br/>Astral Spirit is an effective harassing and pushing tool throughout the early game that can be used without putting Elder Titan in danger.<br/><br/>Be careful, though: it costs 110 mana per use. This mana cost can be remedied if your lane partner or you build Arcane Boots. <br/><br/>Although unmentioned, a Refresher Orb is a fairly good choice for the Elder Titan; two casts of Earth Splitter will both severely damage the enemy and slow them for an extended duration, if both hit. Be aware that you need items to augment your mana pool, though.<br/><br/>Elder Titan can excel even with just one or two core items. Eul's Scepter of Divinity, for example, solves his mana problems while giving a reliable disable to set up an Echo Stomp or Earth Splitter.<br/><br/>Due to his tankiness, Elder Titan can carry auras effectively. Items like Ring of Basilius, Drum of Endurance, Mekansm, Pipe of Insight, Vladmir's Offering and Assault Cuirass can help the whole team, as long as Elder Titan stays alive and close to his allies.<br/><br/>Power Treads will make you able to land more hits after the Spirit returns, and switching to Intelligence can help with the low mana pool; Phase Boots pair well with the movement speed bonus granted by the Astral Spirit; Arcane Boots give much more mana to spam spells; later in the game, Boots of Travel can be used to counter-push or counter-gank.<br/><br/>While Elder Titan makes a great initiator, he is also great at breaking enemy team initiations. If you can react fast enough and use a long range Echo Stomp through your spirit the moment your allies get initiated on you will open the way for your allies to reorganize and re-position to follow up on your Earth Splitter. <br/><br/>In later stages of the game when your team sieges and pushes towers Astral Spirit makes a magnificent tool in scouting ahead to check enemy positions without putting anyone on your team in danger. To better control your spirit you can actually assign it to a group so you can immediately select it whenever it is available.<br/><br/>Remember that the sleep from Echo Stomp is not a stun and enemy units will immediately wake up if they take any sort of hero damage. If an allied Elder Titan is preparing to initiate make sure you do not attack the enemy until his Earth Splitter activates and maims the enemy team.<br/><br/>Early game in certain cases you can use the mechanics of Echo Stomp to your advantage. Consider the fact that only player based damage awakens sleeping units if you perhaps can knockout an enemy in the range of your tower for example you can do considerable damage.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is an item which can allow you to deal 70% of enemies' HP in a team fight by casting Earth Splitter twice in succession, severely crippling them within moments. This set up will need careful coordination with your team and a successfully executed Echo Stomp.<br/><br/>An early Soul Ring will allow you to spam Astral Spirit constantly while still in the laning phase, adding a considerable amount of harassment potential to Elder Titan."

Aiushtha hears the pleas of the small creatures, the furtive folk who need green shade and a leafy canopy to thrive. She lends her ears to those who have no other listeners.

Other legends tell that he is an ancient being of strange gravity, the abyss personified-a twisted voice from out the original darkness, before the first light in the universe. And there are older legends that say he is the first collapsed star, a black hole grown complicated and sentient-his motivations unknowable, his power inexorable, a force of destruction unleashed upon existence itself.",
      "tips": "Keeping Eidolons around you is a very good idea when there is a Pudge or Mirana on the enemy team, as it makes you very difficult to be hooked or arrowed, which is important considering that Enigma is very easy prey for kills in the early game.<br/><br/>In sufficient number, Eidolons can be used effectively in encounters, as en masse their collective attack does significant damage. If you die in an encounter and you have Eidolons still alive, use them to boost your team's damage a little.<br/><br/>Enigma's presence in encounters is greatly diminished while Black Hole is on cooldown, but he can make himself useful by saving Malefice for a crucial moment and also sneaking around to use Midnight Pulse within an area the enemies may try to escape through. A good combo is to use Malefice on an enemy walking through Midnight Pulse.<br/><br/>Enigma works best with allied heroes who have strong AoE capabilities, such as Warlock or Queen of Pain.<br/><br/>Enigma can kill Roshan before the 10-minute mark, with the help of Level 3 or 4 Eidolons. For acquiring them, use Demonic Conversion on either a neutral creep if he's on the Radiant side, or a lane creep if he's on the Dire side. An item commonly picked up is a Medallion of Courage, as it allows him to reduce Roshan's armor for a higher damage output. Begin the fight by tanking Roshan yourself, until your Eidolons have multiplied; let the Eidolons take over and apply a Healing Salve. Try to micro the Eidolons to distribute the damage that Roshan does to them. Re-cast Demonic Conversion on one of the Eidolons before they expire and repeat the process (tank, heal up, nuke). If executed properly, Roshan will fall within about one minute.<br/><br/>Enigma's large mana consumption means that an Arcane Boots can be an effective boots upgrade. If the player chose to ignore upgrading boots, Boots of Travel may be taken later on to take advantage of his pushing power. <br/><br/>Necronomicon is a powerful tool when used with Black Hole. <br/><br/>Shadow Blade is a viable alternative to Blink Dagger.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a great substitute for Blink Dagger, offering some Intelligence. <br/><br/>Rod of Atos also works on Enigma as it helps with both his mana and health.<br/><br/>Blademail discourages Heroes outside of your Black Hole from attacking you. Ghost Scepter can be used to a similar effect. <br/><br/>Urn of Shadows may also prove to be a useful item on a team with hardcore gankers as the mana regeneration and strength boost really helps him out early in the game. <br/><br/>Enigma can get Mekansm and Pipe of Insight quickly thanks to his jungling ability. <br/><br/>Linken's Sphere, as an alternative to Black King Bar, is a good item when up against Heroes with disables as their ultimates such as Doom and Bane.<br/><br/>One of the deadliest combos executed with Black Hole is Sand king's Epicenter. Locking all heroes in will allow Sand King to channel it safely, while also making sure the pulses hit 95% of the time, dealing extraordinary damage. Even more so if both have Aghanim's Scepter."

It remains a mystery why this being from another dimension believes the struggle for the Nemesis Stones is worth entering our physical plane, but apparently an upset in the balance of power in this world has repercussions in adjacent dimensions. Time means nothing to Darkterror, except as a way to thwart his foes and aid his allies. His long-view of the cosmos has given him a remote, disconnected quality, although in battle he is quite capable of making it personal.",
      "tips": "Mask of Madness will allow Faceless Void better to utilize Chronosphere throughout game, as does almost any item that gives attack speed or damage. A BKB is usually a good choice after getting a MoM as nukers outside the chronosphere can be ignored, while they otherwise burst the fragile Void very easily.<br/><br/>When using Chronosphere it's important that you prioritize the targets to deal maximum damage. Important targets include carries and spellcasters.<br/><br/>If you want to play your lane aggressively, level Time Lock first, conversely if you need to play defensively, level Backtrack after getting at least one level of Time Walk as it is still your primary escape mechanism, while also having some offensive potential.<br/><br/>Chronosphere will pause friendly units (exception : units under control of Faceless Void) and heroes as well as foes. Try to position it so enemies are within the sphere and allies are outside and can reach enemies inside without having to enter the Chronosphere itself.<br/><br/>Using later levels of Time Walk and Chronosphere in tandem can easily catch entire enemy teams off guard.<br/><br/>Faceless Void goes together well with heroes that have ranged ultimates, such as Lich, Jakiro, Witch Doctor and Gyrocopter. Chronosphere can trap enemy heroes in place for several seconds. <br/><br/>If you are trying to decide on what item build is best for Faceless Void remember that his main goal is to do the most damage and hopefully kill at least one key enemy hero inside his Chronosphere where he has a 5 second free rein to attack a target without any chance of retaliation. <br/><br/>While Aghanim's Scepter may diminish your carry potential sometimes it might come in handy as it increases your Chronosphere duration to 6 seconds and reduces its cooldown to only 60 seconds, allowing your ultimate to be ready in almost any team fight and while it may not contribute to your damage output very much it does increase your survivability by granting you stats and HP.<br/><br/>Juggernaut's Omnislash is not stopped inside your Chronosphere, provided Juggernaut wasn't caught in the Chronosphere in the first place.<br/><br/>A Black King Bar is very crucial item if you find yourself interrupted by magic attacks from units not caught in your Chronosphere e.g. stuns and disables. Every second counts when the Chronosphere is in use, and getting stunned or hexed from outside interference can result with your Chronosphere expiring without any enemies getting killed.<br/><br/>A Refresher Orb combined with Aghanim's Scepter will allow you to lock down the entire enemy team for 12 seconds at Level 3 Chronosphere and will provide the longest hard Crowd Control in the game, provided you have the initial manapool to cast Chronosphere twice and use Refresher's active. This is more than enough time to kill two or three enemies, even without damage items, and allows you to make use of the full duration of Mask of Madness active. While it is not viable in most circumstances, if purchased fast enough after Aghanim's Scepter, it will allow you to wholly dominate the enemy team. <br/><br/>Battlefury gives you good damage with health and mana regen. It is also great when you use Chronosphere and have multiple heroes caught inside it. Its cleave enables you to deal damage to multiple foes rather than one target at a time. If Faceless Void is powerful enough, he can kill an entire team caught inside the Chronosphere with Battlefury."

      "bio": "After serving through a lifetime of wars, upheaval, riots, and revolutions, the brass figured Aurel had seen enough. But in addition to a few trinkets and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter, the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and money, he set to work building the device. As the years wore on and the remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight. As dusk settled in he set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris. Days later, when Aurel returned to his workshop, he set to work on yet another gyrocopter, this one capable of carrying a much heavier, more dangerous payload.",

   "huskar": {
      "bio": "Emerging from the throes of the sacred Nothl Realm, Huskar opened his eyes to see the prodigal shadow priest Dazzle working a deep incantation over him. Against the ancient rites of the Dezun Order, Huskar's spirit had been saved from eternity, but like all who encounter the Nothl he found himself irrevocably changed. No longer at the mercy of a mortal body, his very lifeblood became a source of incredible power; every drop spilled was returned tenfold with a fierce, burning energy. However this newfound gift infuriated Huskar, for in his rescue from the Nothl, Dazzle had denied him a place among the gods. He had been denied his own holy sacrifice. In time the elders of the order sought to expand their influence and Huskar, they agreed, would be a formidable tool in their campaign. Yet becoming a mere weapon for the order that denied him his birthright only upset him further. As the first embers of war appeared on the horizon, he fled his ancestral home to find new allies, all the while seeking a cause worthy of unleashing the power his total sacrifice could bring.",
      "tips": "Remember that Huskar becomes more powerful with less health, but can still die. Figure out when enough is enough.<br/><br/>You can use Inner Vitality on yourself before jumping into a fight to counteract the damage you take.<br/><br/>Burning Spear and Life Break both use up health, and feed your Berserker's Blood.<br/><br/>Remember that Burning Spears will stack on an enemy. Switch it to auto-attack and burn them down!<br/><br/>Life Break lowers the target's current HP to 1/2 (1/3 if upgraded), and lets Huskar jump to his target immediately. Consider between chasing a wounded enemy and dealing damage to a tough one.<br/><br/>You should be warned not to use your ultimate on a hero who has an active magic immunity or else you lose a percentage of your health while the target does not. However, the slow will still pass through magic immunity.<br/><br/>Huskar's Berserker's Blood increases your survivability significantly. At 30% health, and level 4 Berserker's Blood, you have 83% magic resistance, allowing you to keep your HP in place while taking physical attacks if you have lifesteal and decent damage from items. It is also worth noting that with enough stacks and HP left, it can help you survive execution spells that deal magic damage such as Sniper's Assassinate and Necrophos' Reaper's Scythe.<br/><br/>Black King Bar is important to keep in mind on Huskar since you don't lose a percentage of your health when you use your ultimate, and allows you to kill pure damage based Heroes like Timbersaw without the risk of death.<br/><br/>Some players only level Burning Spears to level 1 (for early harassment), and then go on to max Berserker's blood and pick up an early Morbid Mask (later Helm of the Dominator and eventually Satanic). You will absorb more HP and deal more damage the lower your hp is, and the Helm of the Dominator is a great tool for jungling, but ever since latest buff to Burning Spears, this build (or not taking the ability at all) is considered outdated.<br/><br/>Huskar is effective at dealing with lone targets, but often time struggles when enemies are grouped up. Don't get too cocky, even if you can take on anybody on the enemy team. It's usually best to let somebody else initiate, and then come into the fight when the enemies are spread out, that way, you can take them on one at a time and most likely win each of the duels.<br/><br/>One can build a Maelstrom or Mjollnir to take advantage of Huskar's fast attack speed, and proc Chain Lightning, giving Huskar decent teamfight ability. <br/><br/>Use Inner Vitality before you use Life Break because Inner Vitality has a fairly long duration.<br/><br/>While with Berserker's Blood Huskar is nigh impossible to kill by spell casters, be very cautious of pure damage and HP removal. Dealing with heroes such as Bane and Timbersaw can result in death, as using Life Break in their presence can have dire consequences, since their spells aren't reduced by magic resistance.<br/><br/>Also beware that despite his agility gain Huskar's armor is relatively low even until the middle stages of the game and thus if your ultimate is used carelessly the enemy team will only require one or two disables to allow their own carries to kill you. In this respect you must pay special attention to heroes with long duration disables such as Bane, Alchemist, Shadow Shaman, Dragon Knight etc.<br/><br/>As Life Break deals Magical damage to an enemy relative to his current HP, it is possible through damage amplification to kill any enemy in one hit provided it is not magic immune or has access to very high Magical resistance (e.g. Spell Shield).<br/><br/>It is possible to use certain combinations of items and heroes together with Huskar to kill any hero instantly. For example applying the effects of Veil of Discord, Ethereal Blade, Orchid Malevolence to a target and then hitting them with an Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Life Break will cause an instant death. However building all these utility items onto Huskar himself will destroy a great deal of his carry potential. This same effect can be achieved using Shadow Demon's Soul Catcher instead of Veil of Discord or Pugna's Decrepify instead of Ethereal Blade.<br/><br/>When faced with fed physical damage dealing carries and you have no counter-pick on your team, it is wise to build items that specifically counter them so that you can duel them such as Heaven's Halberd or in special cases Orchid Malevolence for heroes with escapes like Storm Spirit or Anti-Mage."

   "invoker": {
      "bio": "In its earliest, and some would say most potent form, magic was primarily the art of memory. It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell's power. The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells--four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one--with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap--a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world's first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world's dying days.",
      "tips": "Learning the combinations for Invoker's spells is essential for success.<br/><br/>Invoker is a prime candidate for mid lane; however, due to his flexibility he can also take other lane positions. Safe lane solo vs another solo laner or as the farmer with supports also allow Invoker to get the gold and EXP he needs to be strong.<br/><br/>What orb you should start with can sometimes be decided once you see your lane matchup, but often needs to be decided when you buy your items.<br/><br/>Starting with Quas is the most durable starting build, giving you +3 hp/s with 3 orbs, but leaves you with very low damage, which can make it hard to lasthit without being denied. Your starting build should probably be high on attributes and low on regen to compensate. At level 2, you get access to Cold Snap with Invoke, which is an amazing spell to fight back in lane. This start is strong for lanes that are strong against you and can harass you down.<br/><br/>Starting with Exort gives you the strongest lasthitting potential, giving you +11 damage with 3 exort orbs (+3 per orb and +2 from the intelligence gain). This gives you much easier lasthitting. Against melee lanes or other weak lanes, you can start with a high attribute build to dominate lane, but against laners that can fight you, you'll need a high amount of regen to stay in lane. At level 2, you can take Invoke to get access to Sun Strike or take a point in Quas and delay Invoke to level 3. If the other lanes are high in stuns, Sun Strike allows you to help get kills, but it isn't very strong without team coordination.<br/><br/>Starting with Wex is not recommended. However, in niche cases, it can work. Starting with boots and wex, if you're going offlane against a strong dual-lane or tri-lane can allow you to escape with your life intact, but both that starting item choice and starting ability choice are for players experienced with offlaning and Invoker.<br/><br/>There are three primary ability builds for Invoker, though Quas-Wex and Quas-Exort are the more common and generally stronger choices.<br/><br/>A Quas-Wex build is primarily about disabling your opponents, while making you a bit more durable; its main drawback is that without items you will be in need of Intelligence or mana regeneration. This is usually fixed with a Eul's Scepter or Scythe of Vyse. In the early game, you should try to use Cold Snap to scare enemies and maybe kill them, while your main combo in the mid game will be Tornado followed by EMP, with it, you'll deal a lot of damage and will drain most of your enemies' mana, but you have to time it well, since EMP won't work on cycloned units. In the late game, try to use Alacrity on yourself or the main carry if you're able to; use your main combo and/or Deafening Blast to disable enemies.<br/><br/>A Quas-Exort build is focused primarily on damage, from both your spell combos and right-click. Your goal in the early game is to have 4 points in Exort followed by 4 points in Quas to get two Forged Spirits, achievable at level 9. Forged Spirits in combination with Cold Snap is great for kill potential and Forged Spirits are great for pushing down towers or clearing jungle camps. Your primary spell combo is Chaos Meteor followed by Deafening Blast.<br/><br/>An Exort or Wex-Exort oriented build gives a lot of Intelligence, but leaves you with less HP. In the early game you'll have global presence thanks to your Sun Strike which, if timed well, can deal huge damage. In mid and late game, try to initiate with your Chaos Meteor, followed by Deafening Blast. You can also add Tornado before the two abilities if you have enough mana, which will make it harder for the enemies to escape or flee. Use Alacrity on the main damage dealer if you're able to.<br/><br/>While your orbs are primarily thought about for what ability they invoke, having the right orbs for your situation is also important for strong Invoker play. If you're lasthitting, having 3 Exort orbs out is best. If you're not at max HP, having 3 Quas orbs out is best. If you're moving around the map, having 3 Wex orbs out is best. The tough part becomes rapidly switching between the orbs, eg. pulling out 3 Exort orbs, immediately throwing out an attack to get a last hit, then swapping back to Quas orbs, and repeating for every last hit when not at max HP.<br/><br/>As Invoker is one of the most level-dependent heroes in the game, and also scales well with gold, a Hand of Midas can be a very strong pickup. Be careful, however, as getting a Midas too late into the game or against heroes that are strong in the early game can be a bad idea, as buying a Midas leaves you weaker than buying other items in the immediate future.<br/><br/>For Quas, the highest level you will usually need is 2-4, as higher levels are generally not useful; Level 4 is only useful in that it allows you to have 2 Forged Spirits.<br/><br/>All of Invoker's spells have fairly long cooldowns and are individually fairly complex, while also having strong synergy with each other. Understanding how to use his spells effectively and how to combo them is key to playing Invoker well.<br/><br/>Cold Snap is, in most cases, your first and main ability in the early portion of the game. Use it to scare and harass enemies, especially when they are among allied creeps. To make better use of this ability, activate it right after right clicking on the enemy Hero, then keep attacking him whenever possible, without putting yourself in danger.<br/><br/>Ghost Walk is your most reliable escape mechanism. It makes you invisible with no fade time, and also slows enemies. Be careful when Invoking it, as it costs 200 mana to activate. Be careful about walking through opponents that have detection or spells that hit invisible units, however, as it reveals your position.<br/><br/>Ice Wall is perfect for teamfights as well as for 1 vs 1 fights. You need good positioning to use it, so it's preferable to have Phase Boots, Force Staff or even Blink Dagger to help you use this ability effectively. It damages and greatly slows enemies, making it perfect in combination with Cold Snap, Sun Strike, Chaos Meteor, EMP and Deafening Blast. You can cast Tornado right before it to make positioning easier.<br/><br/>EMP is an AoE nuke that drains the enemies' mana, while damaging them. Use it in combination with Tornado to guarantee mana drain and damage. It's a nice nuke for mid game teamfights, but it becomes less efficient as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Tornado is a useful ability that can be used to save teammates, damage enemies or even chase them, thanks to its enormous range. It can be a great setup for EMP, Chaos Meteor, Sunstrike, and Ice Wall, just be mindful that your opponents are invulnerable while in air. This spell is also great for clearing out creep waves, though be mindful about using it for that, as it does have a lengthy cooldown.<br/><br/>Alacrity is a great pushing ability, which is especially useful in late game. Use it on yourself, on your allies or even on your Forged Spirits to take down towers with ease. Cast it on your team's carry to help him deal even more damage.<br/><br/>Sun Strike is a deadly nuke with global range, which is perfect to kill fleeing Heroes. It has a little delay, so time it well. Avoid hitting more than one enemy, otherwise it will deal less damage, since it's spread evenly between targets in its area of effect. This includes creeps, so aiming for heroes in creep waves will also greatly reduce the damage.<br/><br/>Forge Spirit lets you summon one or two Spirits that will reduce the enemy Heroes' armor while attacking. It can be used to harass, scout or push. Use it with Cold Snap, Alacrity or Ice Wall to inflict constant damage over time.<br/><br/>Chaos Meteor is a powerful nuke, capable of hitting many units at once. It rolls forward and, much like Sun Strike, it has a little delay, so you have to take positioning into account while using it. It can be used with Deafening Blast to initiate a battle and deal colossal damage if executed correctly, especially in the mid and late game. You can cast Tornado before using your Chaos Meteor to make positioning easier, and to make sure that the enemies can't escape. This spell is also great for clearing out creep waves, though be mindful about using it for that, as it does have a lengthy cooldown.<br/><br/>Deafening Blast has many uses, slightly depending on your ability build. It's mainly used to disable enemies, so that they can't run away or an ally of yours (or even yourself) can escape. If going for an Exort oriented build, it is best used in combination with Chaos Meteor to keep your opponents under the meteor for longer, increasing the combo's damage. If going for a Quas-Wex oriented build, its damage will be greatly reduced, but on the other hand its disabling power will make it easier to win teamfights or to save allies, while pushing back enemy Heroes.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is a very useful item on Invoker since his invoked abilities have rather high cooldowns. There are some occasions you find yourself waiting for your cooldowns, such as lengthy team fights."

Io is nothing less than the sum of all attractive and repulsive forces within the material field, a sentient manifestation of the charge that binds existence together. It is only in the controlled warping of these electrical waylines that Io's presence can be experienced on the physical plane.

      "tips": "Tether can be used on allied heroes to get to their side with great speed, as it latches from a considerable distance.<br/><br/>Approaching a confrontation from behind will allow for easier use of Tether's slow. Positional items are also useful for this.<br/><br/>Spirits requires much practice and focus to control, and due to its high mana cost it is not advisable to use it frivolously.<br/><br/>Building Heart of Tarrasque or other HP regen items will allow for much more liberal use of your Overcharge. Also, the regen you get from these items will heal your tether partner, allowing you to heal allies by using Overcharge.<br/><br/>Remember that Tether can be used on friendly creeps, and in a dangerous situation Io may be able to avoid death by Tethering to a lane creep, owing to Tether's large latch distance.<br/><br/>Should an emergency arise, Io may Tether to a wounded ally and then Relocate to the fountain to heal both Io and his ally.<br/><br/>You can also save the life of a crucial allied hero with this method, but it will often result in your own inevitable death when Relocate forces you to return to your original location. Be sure to un-Tether your ally before you return.<br/><br/>The inverse of this can also work; Relocate from your fountain to the crucial ally and Tether them to bring them back. This is not always viable however, as it entails the 12 second discrepancy between Relocations.<br/><br/>If Io's team has an end-game carry such as Phantom Assassin or Faceless Void, his top priority becomes ensuring the survival of this hero at any cost, including his own life. Io's skillset makes him very good at doing this, and if he succeeds in preserving the life of his carry then they will eventually become hugely powerful, and most likely win the game for their team.<br/><br/>A good way to make Io cause a lot of damage with his nuke quickly is to summon the spirits, make them get closer, and when the cooldown has ended, get close to the enemy and activate the spell again. This way, all the spirits around you will explode damaging the enemy and five new ones will appear, potentially exploding on him too. Best used if Io is laning with someone with a good slow or stun, and when used to maximum potential (exploding all 10 spirits at maximum level) will cause 1000 magical damage.<br/><br/>When ganking or escaping, always remember that Tether duration is the same as its cooldown, so it can be maintained on constantly as long as you have enough mana.<br/><br/>Though using Tether to offer bonus healing from items such as Tranquil Boots or an Urn of Shadows charge is a good idea, your Tethered ally will not gain anything if you are fully healed. Using Overcharge to lower your health and mana before using any healing items will assure you are able to pass along the boosted regeneration.<br/><br/>Soul Ring is an excellent Item if you have Tranquil Boots so that you can give your Tethered target HP regen and also the Soulring Activation Mana. <br/><br/>A Bottle is good for the same reasons as Soul Ring; healing yourself and your partner in battle, and as well as giving mana.<br/><br/>Mask of Madness is a great situational item for increasing Io's DPS and survivability. Thanks to Overcharge, at max level Io only takes 10% extra damage for up to 170 IAS, 30% extra movement speed and 20% lifesteal. Due to Io's fragility, however, it is important that Mask of Madness is used in conjunction with HP and Armour boosting Items, as he can't be burst damaged down while under its effects. Note that if you use Overcharge and Mask of Madness while tethered to an ally or Necro warrior/archer, the movement speed boost is increased to 47% for yourself, and the Tethered unit still gains the 20% damage reduction and 70 attack speed and 17% movement speed bonus."

      "tips": "When getting to level 6, you may opt to skip your ultimate when you don't have Arcane Boots, as the crowd control it does in comparison to spamming your other abilities is lesser and much more expensive.<br/><br/>Leveling Icepath over Liquid Fire and Dual Breath is not advisable as each level of Icepath only adds 0.4 seconds of duration and 1 second of cool down and no additional damage. Leveling Icepath past level 1 does not provide much additional impact in the early game. <br/><br/>Leveling Dual Breath over Liquid Fire is also not advisable. This is because each level of Dual Breath only provides 100 additional damage for a relatively significant mana cost increase (5/15/15/15) while Liquid Fire provides a free spell (not an attack if cast manually, i.e., goes through evasion) that causes enemy heroes to have significant difficulty with last hitting as the increase of the attack speed slow per level of Liquid Fire is 10%/level and reduces the cool down by 5/5/5/6. This provides a consistent 30 dps/50% attack speed slow if maxed at level 7 with 0 mana cost compared to a level 4 Dual Breath that only provides 38 dps at a mana cost of 17 mana per second without increasing the movement or attack speed slow. Maxing Liquid Fire first also provides a significant boost to early damage dealt to towers if your lane is pushing. This spell also slows towers attack speed providing less damage to your team and creeps when a tower is being pushed.<br/><br/>On level 1 Dual Breath does similar damage to Icepath. So your choice is between ms/ias slow from Dual Breath or a stun from Icepath.<br/><br/>The huge range and lasting area effect of Icepath make it roughly analogous to Earthshaker's Fissure. It is an amazing spell for opening up opportunities to fight or to shut down aggression. It doesn't do much damage however. <br/><br/>If another hero in your team is already getting Mekansm, you can instead buy a Veil of Discord to not only boost your already high AOE damage, but your teammates' as well.<br/><br/>Though Dual Breath has the greatest damage of any of his abilities when at level 4, it should still not be prioritized over Liquid Fire because it only does 8 dps more than Liquid Fire while draining your mana. Dual Breath and Icepath should not be prioritized over Liquid Fire even if your team is focusing on ganking as it provides the biggest impact via attack speed slow and consistent dps. <br/><br/>Liquid Fire is a spell with a smaller area of effect but has the largest damage growth (the dps for all four levels roughly doubles for each level and the dps is as follows: 3.75/6.67/12.5/30), but its effect is free additional damage and provides an attack speed slow, and should be prioritized during the early game as it can be active consistently when fully leveled.<br/><br/>Hits with Liquid Fire are very useful for tower pushing as it reduces their attack speed and deals damage even if Jakiro and his lane mates are not staying in tower range to attack it. Hit-and-runs with Liquid Fire can reduce tower health significantly.<br/><br/>It is also suitable for pushing lane creeps in the same way, although players should not expect to push down waves in the same way as other, more powerful lane control spells. Instead, they should use it in conjunction with Dual Breath and use the combined Damage over time to push the lane.<br/><br/>When you can afford it, opting for a Shiva's Guard can be used to stack with your Dual Breath and Liquid Fire's MS slows to maximize the time your enemies spend inside Macropyre's AOE.<br/><br/>Shiva's Guard also stacks with Dual Breath and Liquid Fire's attack speed slows providing even more impact.<br/><br/>Combine Macropyre with spells that keep the enemy in place as long as possible, such as Chronosphere, Black Hole or Upheaval. It does not guarantee damage without these effect and is a fairly low damage spell, so chaining it with other spells is necessary for any real effect. <br/><br/>This also works to counter enemy spells and melee heroes that require they stay in an area; throw Macropyre from outside Chronosphere, for example, to dissuade Void from attacking your teammates.<br/><br/>Jakiro's fun/alternate name was Double Dragon, the first arcade and console game published by Taito."

Using it alongside Healing Ward can result in escaping even the most difficult situations.<br/><br/>Blade Fury works great in combination with the Move command. After starting Blade Fury, use the Move command on the enemy hero to automatically follow him and maximize the spell's damage output.<br/><br/>Omnislash works best if you catch an enemy hero away from their creeps. Time it well to avoid wasting hits on creeps, and ensure your enemy doesn't have any blink or invisibility spells, as those will cause your ultimate to not affect them.<br/><br/>Healing Ward is a great way to keep pushes going and heal yourself. Make sure you don't neglect it!<br/><br/>Taking the Attribute Bonus rather than Healing Ward and Blade Dance at very early levels may be a good idea due to your high mana costs and lack of survivability. Focusing on attributes and Blade Fury up until you can get Omnislash makes you far more viable in survivability and mana management.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled into thinking you are hard to kill while using Blade Fury. Enemies who have a high amount of physical damage, such as Drow Ranger or Sven, will be able to deal heavy damage to you even if you are under Blade Fury's effects.<br/><br/>Watch out for any enemy hero/heroes who have the ability to become Ethereal. Ethereal heroes caught by Omnislash will be left unhurt by it and only wastes precious slashes.<br/><br/>Experienced Juggernaut players can use a Blink Dagger in order to continue an Omnislash if there are targets some distance away.

As such, he will always have money for wards, and should ward extensively; as vision of the enemy allows for powerful Illuminate strikes.<br/><br/>Although Illuminate is extremely powerful for early-game pushing and harassment, it will disrupt the farm of your laning partner; so if used it should be positioned only to damage the enemy heroes. Owing to his ability to replenish his mana, Illuminate can be used constantly; but mana replenishment is generally better used on his laning partner.<br/><br/>Using Mana Leak and then Illuminate on a foe will force them either to take damage or lose mana; depending on whether or not they choose to move.<br/><br/>Remember that you are a support. While maxing Illuminate seems a good choice for the damage and the pushing potential, it will also make you an easy prey to ganks. Unless you wish to push hard really early, consider maxing Chakra Magic first, which is very useful in the early stages of the game. If you are soloing a lane, a viable option for Ezalor; Illuminate can be maxed first and used to scare the enemy heroes into losing their lane.<br/><br/>Keeper of the Light is a very effective lane support for Heroes who are very mana dependent; Chaos Knight, Morphling, Juggernaut, Wraith King, Magnus, Tiny, Zeus, Leshrac, Ancient Apparition and many other Heroes will have their lane sustainability greatly augmented by your presence.<br/><br/>Mana Leak will instantly stun Lone Druid's bear, as he has no mana by default. Use this to save yourself or your teammates from being chased down by the bear.<br/><br/>When being chased, don't be afraid to use Spirit Form to aid in your escape. While Mana Leak can discourage enemies from chasing you, you could also use Blinding Light to knock back and blind chasing enemies, or cast Illuminate in the direction you are headed, either forcing the enemy to walk in front of the channeling spirit and take damage, or stop chasing and allowing you to escape."

      "bio": "As The Admiral of the mighty Claddish Navy, Kunkka was charged with protecting the isles of his homeland when the demons of the Cataract made a concerted grab at the lands of men. After years of small sorties, and increasingly bold and devastating attacks, the demon fleet flung all its carnivorous ships at the Trembling Isle. Desperate, the Suicide-Mages of Cladd committed their ultimate rite, summoning a host of ancestral spirits to protect the fleet. Against the demons, this was just barely enough to turn the tide. As Kunkka watched the demons take his ships down one by one, he had the satisfaction of wearing away their fleet with his ancestral magic. But at the battle's peak, something in the clash of demons, men and atavistic spirits must have stirred a fourth power that had been slumbering in the depths. The waves rose up in towering spouts around the few remaining ships, and Maelrawn the Tentacular appeared amid the fray. His tendrils wove among the ships, drawing demon and human craft together, churning the water and wind into a raging chaos. What happened in the crucible of that storm, none may truly say. The Cataract roars off into the void, deserted by its former denizens. Kunkka is now The Admiral of but one ship, a ghostly rig which endlessly replays the final seconds of its destruction. Whether he died in that crash is anyone's guess. Not even Tidehunter, who summoned Maelrawn, knows for sure.",

   "legion_commander": {
      "bio": "They came without warning. Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound, and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count, wielding flame and foul sorcery, slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose. Of once-mighty Stonehall's military strength only the Bronze Legion, led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin, was near enough to answer the call of battle. They rode into their city, fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets, cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion: an ethereal rift within the city square, and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion.<br/><br/>Enwrapped in a corrosive shimmer, the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade, cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil. Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast. It turned, smiling at her through a maze of teeth. Heedless of the battle raging around them, they charged one another.<br/><br/>Deflecting blow after blow, the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them. Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her. The odds turned. The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly, a brutal thrust from the side, but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke. Blade scraped on blade, beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below, carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood. The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack, driving her blade through her foe's flesh into the stampeding heart within. With a scream that split the clouds above, the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish. The stygian portal wavered, the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared. The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel.<br/><br/>Though victorious, the survivors saw little to celebrate: the city lay in ruins, and survivors were few. Fires continued to spread. Unfurling her banners of war, Tresdin gathered what allies she could. Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss, and damned be any who would dare stand in her way.",
      "tips": "When using your Ultimate, be sure to cast it on an enemy Hero who is relatively weaker than you, or has a fairly low amount of health remaining in order to ensure that the bonus damage will be given to you.<br/><br/>Legion Commander works well with gankers, especially Bloodseeker, who is able to detect low-health Heroes in the map.<br/><br/>If teamed up with a Pudge try to keep close with him. Pudge can make enemy heroes come to you, when enemies know full well not to get caught in your ultimate. Let him do his combos first to soften up the caught foe, before casting Duel to ensure a kill. You'll both benefit this way, Pudge gets his bonus strength and you get the bonus damage.<br/><br/>Even if an ally dealt the killing blow on the Hero that you are dueling, the bonus damage is still applied to Legion Commander.<br/><br/>Always go with your team. Although Legion Commander is a carry, she is better off with her team, ganking and getting kills through her ultimate rather than farming too much.<br/><br/>Always try to get into fights, just be mindful and select the fights you know you can win. During early to mid-game, try targeting the softer casters or supports e.g. heroes like Crystal Maiden and Shadow Shaman. This way if you were to lose a Duel and they gain the bonus damage, it won't affect your team in the late-game as these heroes rely more on their spells than their auto-attacks.<br/><br/>Any items that can give Legion Commander both health and attack speed is a good pick for her, as she needs the health to be tanky in a Duel, and the attack speed to finish off the enemy before Duel expires. Her attack damage increases through kills from Duel, so items that only give attack damage aren't best bought first.<br/><br/>Minus armour items are particularly good on Legion Commander once you have won a few Duels because she gets attack speed from Press The Attack and damage from winning Duels.<br/><br/>Before casting Duel on someone, try casting Press The Attack first to give you needed bonus attack speed."

His penetrating intelligence is such that he can never ignore for a moment the agonizing horror at the heart of all creation. Once a great philosopher who sought the meaning of existence, he plumbed the depths of nature with the haunted Chronoptic Crystals, and was forever altered by the hideous mysteries thereby revealed to him. Now the darkest depths of his enlightenment are illumined only by the fitful glare of his arrogance. Like other elemental characters, he is completely at one with nature, but in his case it is a nature lurid and vile. He alone sees the evil truth of reality, and has no use for those who believe the cosmos reserves a special reward for those who practice benevolence.",
      "tips": "Diabolic Edict does colossal damage to singular targets; this includes enemy buildings. One-on-one early-mid game, Leshrac is almost impossible to defeat.<br/><br/>Leshrac is a wise pick when you have heroes on your team with a direct stun (e.g. Vengeful Spirit), as they help you land your tricky Split Earth.<br/><br/>In encounters, Leshrac should be very cautious; despite his gigantic damage output he is very easily focused down. Building tanky items or escape items will help with this.<br/><br/>It is important to gain a level and gold advantage early with Leshrac owing to his frailty and dependence on mana items.<br/><br/>If you fail to gain a level and gold advantage early-game, Pulse Nova is extremely useful for farming.<br/><br/>Leshrac is countered by high-burst-damage heroes such as Lina and Ursa, as while Leshrac's damage output is staggering, he requires time to inflict it.<br/><br/>You can increase the overall DPS of Pulse Nova by waiting for the second pulse of damage and then reactivating the ability, because it deals damage as soon as it is activated, you can bypass the 1 second wait and do damage again by reactivating the ability, but keep in mind the high mana cost for reactivating and the cooldown the ability has when using that."

   "lich": {
      "bio": "In life, the frost-mage Ethreain (not yet a Lich) had used the threat of destructive ice to enslave entire kingdoms. His subjects, aided by a few desperate magicians, eventually grew bold enough to ambush him. Armed with enough charmed rope to bind him forever, they tied the frost mage to adamant weights and dropped him in a pool known chiefly for being bottomless. It wasn't. He only fell for a year or so before an outcrop snagged him. There he rested, dead but undecaying, until the geomancer Anhil thought to verify the legend of the supposedly bottomless Black Pool. Anhil's plumbline snarled with the ropes that bound the drowned magician, and up he hauled an unexpected prize. Thinking that by rendering the dead undead, he could question the Lich about the properties of the pool, he removed the bindings and commenced a simple rite of resurrection. Even the descendants of Ethreain's enemies were long forgotten by time, so there were none to warn Anhil against imprudence. But he learned the error of his judgment almost immediately, as Lich threw off the shackles and consumed him.",
      "tips": "Spamming Frost Blast and Sacrifice early game can be extremely effective by harassing and denying efficiently.<br/><br/>An effective strategy is to take Sacrifice immediately. Even though you won't need the mana earned from it, you can deny a creep immediately to prevent the enemy from earning gold (and experience if you did so away from their XP range) and to pull the lane towards your tower. <br/><br/>Continue using Sacrifice on friendly creeps as they travel towards your lane, when done properly you can Sacrifice the creep within your and your lane partner's XP range, but outside of the XP range of your enemy, when done consistently an enormous level advantage can be obtained. This is especially important to do when laning with heroes who have powerful ultimates. For instance, when laning with a Viper against a Riki , getting Viper to level 6 before Riki can net you a kill, whereas Riki getting to level 6 before Viper will require you to get detection for that very same kill attempt.<br/><br/>Despite primarily being a support hero, Lich can play a very effective mid. Combining his powerful Frost Blast to harass the enemy while denying his own creeps can shut down the enemy's laning phase.<br/><br/>Ice Armor is a very cheap yet effective ability. Cast it on nearby allies to keep their armor up, or yourself to increase your own survival.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Ice Armor can be set to auto-cast, automatically casting it on heroes that are being attacked.<br/><br/>Since Lich already has high armor thanks to his Ice Armor, getting a Cloak or even Hood of Defiance will greatly improve his survivability. It can also be built into Pipe of Insight later.<br/><br/>Chain Frost can be one of the most devastating ultimates in the game, and can easily turn a teamfight in your favor when used properly. Use it to deal damage quickly to clustered Heroes.<br/><br/>One of the biggest disadvantages of Chain Frost is its slow movement speed. This gives time for enemies to split apart preventing chain frost from bouncing. You can however, work with heroes like Dark Seer's Vacuum, Faceless Void's Chronosphere or Enigma's Black Hole which locks heroes in place taking the full damage from Chain Frost for an extremely devastating damage.<br/><br/>Heroes like Queen of Pain, Death Prophet or Tiny are able to clear creep waves quickly allowing Chain Frost to deal its full damage to heroes. <br/><br/>When casting Chain Frost on a lone Hero (targeting the hero with Chain Frost) with 5 creeps, there is approximately ~55% chance of it hitting a hero twice, and ~65% of it hitting a hero twice with 3 creeps. This almost assures a kill on most lone heroes provided the enemy has no escape mechanism with 3 creeps at early levels. Be sure to follow up with a Frost Blast to slow them from escaping Chain Frost range.<br/><br/>If Lich catches the enemy team killing Roshan, using Chain Frost will force them to desist and/or deal huge damage to all of them; as Roshan's Lair is very difficult to disperse inside, especially when slowed.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb will increase his ultimate ability's damage output by a very large margin, especially if it is a follow up on disabling team fight abilities such as Tidehunter's Ravage, Faceless Void's Chronosphere or Magnus' Reverse Polarity.<br/><br/>After Aghanim's Scepter is acquired, Lich can cast Chain Frost on magic-immune Ancient or Mud Golem camps to make the jungle dangerous to traverse or gank from, as the frost ball will jump infinitely on the magic-immune units, and jump to enemies passing by."

   "lifestealer": {
      "bio": "In the dungeons of Devarque, a vengeful wizard lay in shackles, plotting his escape. He shared his cell with a gibbering creature known as N'aix, a thief cursed by the Vile Council with longevity, so that its life-sentence for theft and cozening might be as punishing as possible. Over the years, its chains had corroded, along with its sanity; N'aix retained no memory of its former life and no longer dreamt of escape. Seeing a perfect vessel for his plans, the wizard wove a spell of Infestation and cast his life-force into N'aix's body, intending to compel N'aix to sacrifice itself in a frenzy of violence while the mage returned to his body and crept away unnoticed. Instead, the wizard found his mind caught in a vortex of madness so powerful that it swept away his plans and shattered his will. Jarred to consciousness by the sudden infusion of fresh life, N'aix woke from its nightmare of madness and obeyed the disembodied voice that filled its skull, which had only the one thought: To escape. In that moment Lifestealer was born. The creature cast its mind into dungeon guards and soldiers, compelling them to open locks and cut down their companions, opening an unobstructed path to freedom while feeding on their lives. Lifestealer still wears the broken shackles as a warning that none may hold him, but on the inside remains a prisoner. Two minds inhabit the single form--a nameless creature of malevolent cunning, and the Master whose voice he pretends to obey.",
      "tips": "There is a term called the N'aix bomb among players which includes a N'aix player infesting a high mobility hero such as Storm Spirit, Puck, or Queen of Pain to initiate upon enemies by having these heroes enter the fray and unleashing all of their own spells in quick succession before N'aix himself comes out of them and dealing the nuke damage of Infest while following it up with his dps using Rage.<br/><br/>Heart of Tarrasque is a good item pickup as it will allow Lifestealer to keep Armlet of Mordiggian activated indefinitely, and gives him greater durability and damage.<br/><br/>It is possible to Solo Roshan if you're a higher leveled Lifestealer, although it takes a very long time. To do this, you keep attacking Roshan until you reach low health, then go to the nearby Radiant Jungle, and use your abilities to heal, then go back to Roshan and repeat the process. If you plan on doing this, be careful of enemy wards anywhere nearby, as if you get ganked by the enemy team you have a low chance of surviving.<br/><br/>Phase Boots allows the Lifestealer to close distance on his targets early on in order to get within Open Wounds' short range, and is ideal for ganking from the jungle. The lack of Attack Speed from not purchasing Power Treads is negated by allowing the player to level more levels of Rage, increasing both survivability and damage.<br/><br/>A Drum of Endurance works well when combined with Phase Boots as the combined movement speed from both will allow players to catch up with faster enemy Heroes. The attributes also help boost Lifestealer's lacking mana pool, and allow him to gank more often through frequent use of Open Wounds."

      "bio": "The sibling rivalries between Lina the Slayer, and her younger sister Rylai, the Crystal Maiden, were the stuff of legend in the temperate region where they spent their quarrelsome childhoods together. Lina always had the advantage, however, for while Crystal was guileless and naive, Lina's fiery ardor was tempered by cleverness and conniving. The exasperated parents of these incompatible offspring went through half a dozen homesteads, losing one to fire, the next to ice, before they realized life would be simpler if the children were separated. As the oldest, Lina was sent far south to live with a patient aunt in the blazing Desert of Misrule, a climate that proved more than comfortable for the fiery Slayer. Her arrival made quite an impression on the somnolent locals, and more than one would-be suitor scorched his fingers or went away with singed eyebrows, his advances spurned. Lina is proud and confident, and nothing can dampen her flame.",
      "tips": "Combining Light Strike Array with a guaranteed stun such as Vengeful Spirit's Magic Missile or Sven's Storm Hammer makes Lina a serious ganking force early on.<br/><br/>Positional items such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity, Blink Dagger, Force Staff or Phase Boots can help you a lot landing Light Strike Array and thus your whole spell combo without relying on other heroes.<br/><br/>Always cancel the backswing animation after casting your spells, as Lina suffers from long animation times.<br/><br/>In teamfights it can be very beneficial to quickly focus on low-HP or support heroes, as Lina has very good nuking abilities.<br/><br/>When paired with Pugna or Shadow Demon, both of whom have percentage-based damage-increasing mechanics; Lina's burst damage becomes gigantic (a sceptred level 3 Laguna Blade will do about two thousand damage alone) to the extent where she can assassinate enemy heroes with a significant gear/level advantage over her. <br/><br/>If Lina has the basic items she needs; it is wise to augment her physical attack for the sake of Fiery Soul. Almost uniquely among Intelligence supports, Lina's rightclick becomes a serious threat if she attains a level advantage (owing to her enormous Int growth and her passive ability). Some basic items for this build are Daedalus, Eye of Skadi and Monkey King Bar, as well as some form of lifesteal.<br/><br/>Dagon can be used to nearly double the burst damage of Lina's ultimate.<br/><br/>Lina's Laguna Blade can hit for around 2500 damage (without factoring in magic resistance) if she combines Aghanim's Scepter and Refresher Orb, granting her enormous nuking power.<br/><br/>While unmentioned purchasing an Ethereal Blade if the farm is available combined with an Aghanim's Scepter and Lina's naturally high Intelligence gain will give you a perfect combination of survivability through stats, armor and Ghost form and an enormous increase (roughly 2534 not counting the damage from Ether Blast) in damage output allowing Lina to instantly kill most low to average HP heroes provided that she lands all of her spells during the Ether Blast. The slow provided by Ether Blast also comes in very handy in landing Light Strike Array. <br/><br/>If Lina is tending to be targeted first (this is a very common tendency), some survival-increasing/utility items will be of great use.<br/><br/>Some players advocate building a Dagon in place of an Aghanim's Scepter, as it is cheaper (though not if upgraded) and ultimately does more damage (through both its active and its bonus to her attack damage). However, Aghs makes her significantly more durable, whereas Dagon does only slightly, and Lina is very fragile. If you think you are unlikely to die very much, Dagon is probably the wisest choice.<br/><br/>For Fiery Soul to take to its peak, cast Dragon Slave, Light Strike Array, and Laguna Blade successively to take the speed-enhancing effect of Fiery Soul to its maximum potential."

      "bio": "Once a Grandmaster of the Demon Witch tradition of sorcery, Lion earned fame among his brethren for fighting on the side of light and righteousness. But adulation corrupts. With powers surpassed only by his ambition, the mage was seduced by a demon and turned to evil, trading his soul for prestige. After committing horrible crimes that marred his soul, he was abandoned. The demon betrayed him, striking better deals with his enemies. Such was Lion's rage that he followed the demon back to hell and slew it, ripping it limb from limb, taking its demonic hand for his own. However, such demonoplasty comes at a cost. Lion was transfigured by the process, his body transformed into something unrecognizable. He rose from hell, rage incarnate, slaying even those who had once called him master, and laying waste to the lands where he had once been so adored. He survives now as the sole practitioner of the Demon Witch tradition, and those who present themselves as acolytes or students are soon relieved of their mana and carried off by the faintest gust of wind.",
      "tips": "Earth Spike works as both a nuke and a stun, and can hit multiple enemies. Targeting Earth Spike on the ground can be less accurate, but is necessary to utilize the ability's max range.<br/><br/>As a pure disable spell, Hex doesn't deal damage but lasts longer than Earth Spike. It also has an instant cast time, making it a more secure standard opening spell when going on the offensive in a gank (rather than risking a swift enemy reaction to Earth Spike).<br/><br/>Use your disables one after the other so you maximize potential disable time.<br/><br/>Using Mana Drain on enemy heroes is a very good form of harrassment, and it maximises killing potential for laning partners like Anti-Mage.<br/><br/>Whether leveling Mana Drain as a semi-carry is more or less effective is dependent on the situation. If Hex and Earth Spike are leveled and Arcane Boots are built (with an optional Attribute Bonus) Lion will be much harder to kill, and still have enough mana at any time. However, some enemy heroes will be impaired by having their mana stolen from them, and some allied ones will be facilitated. Let the hero lineup on both sides inform your decision. For example, if there is a Storm Spirit or Leshrac on the opposing team, leveling Mana Drain is wise as these heroes are crippled horribly by accelerated loss of mana. However, if the enemy team has an Outworld Devourer or a Keeper of the Light, leveling Mana Drain is fairly pointless as these heroes have abilities which replenish mana for themselves and others.<br/><br/>Mana Drain is still useful if left for late-game, as it greatly reduces Lion's need to return to base.<br/><br/>Mana Drain also pops Linken's Sphere, which makes Lion an excellent hero for catching and focusing down elusive heroes that commonly carry Linken's Sphere like Weaver, Puck, and Storm Spirit. At level 4, it has a 5-second cooldown, which means it should always be available when you need it.<br/><br/>Finger of Death is a very powerful nuke, especially considering Lion's largely supportive role. Use it to help damage enemy carries or to eliminate supports; but try not to use it for a sure kill unless a carry is unable to execute it themselves, as they require kills much more than Lion does. Combined with Dagon, it deals enough damage to one-shot many heroes throughout most of the game, but its best to resist this to allow allies to level.<br/><br/>The low cooldown of Hex and Mana Drain are good for dispelling Linken's Sphere and any illusions.<br/><br/>Lion combos exceptionally well with Lina and Shadow Shaman as his disable will allow Lina to land Light Strike Array not to mention that together they can cut down even high HP heroes within moments. With Shadow Shaman due to the fact that both possess two disable abilities they can effectively disable a hero indefinitely or for a very lengthy duration.<br/><br/>It is not uncommon to see support heroes such as Lion to purchase Ghost Scepter in order to protect themselves from DPS heroes in team fights. If the game is going well you might even consider completing the item into an Ethereal Blade as it not only makes you impervious to physical attacks it allows you to greatly increase the damage output of your spells. Be wary however to not use the Ethereal Blade on a hero your team carry is about to kill as it impedes your own team's dps heroes from attacking your target.<br/><br/>Force Staff is a good alternate to Blink Dagger, it gives more mobility and initiate options, especially if the enemy team has a Radiance. <br/><br/>Phase Boots on a roaming support Lion, when paired with a Bottle, give better chasing and kill potential.<br/><br/>Eul's Scepter of Divinity should also be considered if you are constantly out of mana or need the additional movement speed and disable, and you can not afford Scythe of Vyse."

Now she was far from her homeland, driven half mad from starvation and months of wandering, her army long dead or worse. As she stood at the edge of an ancient forest, a pair of glowing eyes spied on from an elder branch. Something beautiful and deadly sought a meal in the wilting dusk. Without a sound, it turned and left. Fury overtook her. Clutching a rust-eaten dagger, she charged after the beast determined to reclaim even a shred of her past glory, but her quarry would not be caught. Three times she cornered the creature among the rocks and trees, and three times she pounced only to witness its fading shadow darting further into the woods. Yet the full moon shone brightly, and the creature's trail was easy to follow. Arriving in a clearing atop a high hill, the beast's massive feline form sat in the open, attentive and waiting. When the woman brandished her dagger, the creature reared and roared and charged. Death, it seemed, had come for her at long last in this strange place. She stood, calm and ready. A flash of movement, and the beast snatched the dagger from her hand before vanishing into the forest. Stillness. Hooded figures approached. In reverent tones they revealed that Selemene, Goddess of the Moon, had chosen her, had guided her, had tested her. Unwittingly she had endured the sacred rites of the Dark Moon, warriors of the Nightsilver Woods.<br/><br/>She was offered a choice: join the Dark Moon and pledge herself to the service of Selemene, or leave and never return.

Embracing her absolution, she renounced her bloody past, and took up a new mantle as Luna of the Dark Moon, the dreaded Moon Rider, ruthless and ever-loyal guardian of the Nightsilver Woods.",
      "tips": "Luna and Night Stalker complement each other well; as Eclipse causes day to become night and Darkness gives both of them a very long vision range.<br/><br/>Early points in Lunar Blessing will make last-hitting creeps easier. At any rate, make sure you have a single point in it before the first night as only one point is needed for the full amount of vision it bestows.<br/><br/>Early points in Moon Glaives will push the lane. Moon Glaives is commonly not leveled at all until the laning phase has concluded.<br/><br/>Extremely unusually for a hard carry, Luna gains significant killing power with a level advantage, owing to Lucent Beam and by extension Eclipse.<br/><br/>Lucent Beam's cast range is gigantic. Use it to pick off fleeing heroes.<br/><br/>Bear in mind Eclipse's range is much smaller than Lucent Beam's.<br/><br/>Under almost all circumstances Luna should be paired with a disabler for her laning phase; as aside from her high movement speed she has absolutely nothing to help her avoid ganks or kill attempts. <br/><br/>It takes significant skill and knowledge of the game to solo a lane with Luna. Her very small attack range and purely damage-oriented skill set mean she is extremely easy to kill. Even then, it is recommended to have ward vision and easy access to team backup for her to be successful in a solo lane. The advantage of running a solo Luna is that it is essentially high-risk high-reward. A Luna with level advantage doing well can easily set the momentum of the game in her team's favor.<br/><br/>Watch out for enemy heroes that carry a Blade Mail. Enemy heroes who carry them will most likely use them when you activate Eclipse. Any damage they take from Eclipse will reflect back to you, and since Luna is such a fragile hero, she will get hit back hard. Buying a Black King Bar will remedy this problem."

      "bio": "Banehallow was noble-born to the house of Ambry, the greatest of the landed castes in the old kingdom of Slom. Before the Fall, as the King's wants grew strange, and his court grew crowded with sorcerers and charlatans, the house of Ambry was the first to rise against the avarice of the throne. No longer willing to pay homage and fealty, they instead sent six-thousand swords into the capital, where they were wiped out in the Massacre of the Apostates. And then came the teeth behind the old truth: When you strike a king's neck, you had better take his head. Enraged by the betrayal, the king exterminated the vast Ambry bloodline, sparing only the lord of the house and his youngest son, Banehallow. Before all the royal court, with the disgraced lord chained to the ornate marble floor, the King bade his magicians transform the boy into a wolf so that he might tear out his own father's throat. \"Do this,\" the king said, \"so that Lord Ambry will understand the bite of betrayal.\" Powerful magic was invoked, and the child was transformed. But though his body was changed, his spirit remained intact, and instead of biting the exposed neck of his father, he attacked his handlers, tearing them to pieces. A dozen of the King's knights perished under the wolf's teeth before they managed to drive it off into the night. Lord Ambry laughed from his chains even as the King ran him through with a sword. Now the heir to the lost house of Ambry, Banehallow wanders the trail as the Lycan, part warrior, part wolf, in search of justice for all that he lost.",
      "tips": "Wolves can be used to scout runes at the beginning of the match and during the laning phase to avoid losing gold and experience.<br/><br/>Always Summon Wolves in base when going out to jungle for the first time (at about the 0-10 second mark) since the wolves are fast enough that you can get a creep camp killed without using any mana.<br/><br/>Wolves' invisibility at level 3, very low base attack time and quick movement make them great deniers. Use them to destroy runes, aegis and allied towers with all impunity if the situation is too risky, or too far away for you to go there in person. The most talented players will even manage to entirely body-block a hero in a narrow path with both wolves. <br/><br/>Wolves can also be used to scout and keep tabs on particular heroes without them knowing. Select your wolf and hit M (default) and then click an enemy hero; the wolf will follow the hero but will not attack, so it will remain invisible. Do this with each wolf and you can get constant vision of two enemy heroes. This is great for setting up ganks or for evaluating whether to take a team fight in a particular area. Keep in mind that if your wolves lose vision of who they're following for too long, they'll stop following.<br/><br/>At level 8, with items like Vladmir's Offering and Power Treads or Medallion of Courage, Lycan can solo Roshan. Summon your Wolves and tank them alternately with the hero, but not let them die until re-summon is ready. Keep Shapeshift just in case the enemy comes for you, so you can escape.<br/><br/>When taking on Roshan, it is advised to use a Smoke of Deceit to avoid being spotted by enemy observer wards. Teams facing a Lycan will do their best to prevent early Roshan kills by planting observer wards near the pit; given that a detected Lycan is easy prey while doing battle with Roshan, slipping past those wards will do wonders for his lifespan.<br/><br/>Nature's Prophet has great synergy with Lycan, for several reasons. Howl can drastically increase the combat effectiveness of Treants by boosting their damage potential. This same advantage can also aid in handling Roshan, allowing boosted Treants to tank him instead of Lycan. Nature's Prophet is (like Lycan) a jungling and laning hero, so his absence while fighting Roshan is not a great concern for his teammates. Finally, the Prophet's ability to teleport directly into Roshan's pit is also useful for avoiding enemy wards (using Nature's Call in Roshan's Pit with Sprout is advised, however, in order to remain undetected by said wards).<br/><br/>Shapeshift is a very strong and versatile Ultimate to use. When activated, it gives Lycan hasted movement speed, allowing a great deal of maneuverability in battle to chase down fleeing heroes or to escape from potentially dangerous areas. While Shapeshifted, you are immune to every Slow, including Hex, Purge and Slow Ultimates like Epicenter, Freezing Field, and Primal Roar (though if directly targeted by Primal Roar, the stun is still applied).<br/><br/>An Armlet of Mordiggian can be helpful in certain situations, as it provides good DPS for low cost and as well as some survivability. The HP drain is partially negated from the Lifesteal of Vladmir's Offering.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel are highly recommended late game, or when the enemies tier 3 tower or barracks are vulnerable. Whenever the enemy is absent from a lane, you can summon level 3-4 wolves to slip behind enemy creep waves undetected, and then teleport to them to backdoor."

   "magnus": {
      "bio": "The master-smiths of Mt. Joerlak agree on only a single point: that the horn of a magnoceros is more precious than any alloy. And of all such horns, the largest and sharpest belongs to the beast they call Magnus. For half a generation, Magnus took easy sport goring hunters come to claim the treasures of his kin. Each time he would return to his cave with hooves and horns stained red, until his Matriarch urged him and all their kin to seek refuge to the north beyond the shadow of the mountain. But Magnus scoffed, having never failed to defend his people. The magnoceroi would stay, he decided, for a magnoceros does not believe in chance... nor does it ever change its mind. But when Mt. Joerlak erupted without warning, and half his kin perished in the fire and ash, Magnus changed his mind after all. The survivors pushed north, until they reached a blockade watched over by a hundred hunters armed with bow and steel. Magnus expected no less. He led his fiercest brothers and sisters in a charge against their enemies, and fought with a ferocity matched only by the fire-spewing mountain at his back. Meanwhile the magnoceros elders, mothers, and calves vanished into the drifts. The master-smiths are divided about what happened next. Some say Magnus reunited with his kin, while others claim he suffered mortal injuries and expired alongside the body of his Matriarch. Neither theory is correct. Magnus did vow to rejoin his kin...but only after seeking out those responsible for the eruption of Mt. Joerlak and watching them die upon his horn, for a magnoceros does not believe in chance.",
      "tips": "Magnus is one of the few melee heroes who can solo the middle lane well, because of his skill set. It is ideal for him especially if he is needed to be a carry in the late game.<br/><br/>Most of Magnus' abilities work effectively only if his targets are in front of him. When surrounded, Magnus will be forced to change directions too much, not only delaying him from casting spells in rapid succession, but also rendering his spells' area-of-effects useless. As such, place Magnus in the side lines, or until his enemies are in a manageable range in front of him. You should only place yourself in the middle when planning to cast your ultimate, Reverse Polarity, since it forces all of the targets you hit to be in front of you.<br/><br/>Shockwave is Magnus's ranged nuke, one with a low mana cost:<br/><br/>Shockwave is Magnus's signature laning ability, since it's perfect for both harassing heroes and last-hitting creeps. Thanks to the mana cost and low cooldown, Magnus is able to perform this ability continuously, so long as he receives a stable mana supply.<br/><br/>Though usually used against disabled enemies, Shockwave can act as a great finisher to fleeing enemies. Make sure to cast it carefully, since it has a limited range.<br/><br/>Take note of Shockwave's limited area-of-effect. Much like Lion's Earth Spike, Shockwave directly affects targets in a straight path. Aim to hit multiple targets to maximize its effectiveness.<br/><br/>Empower is a great buff that boosts base damage for a long duration, as well as grant cleave with each attack on melee heroes. Use it as much as you can on allies or yourself whenever possible, especially when a team fight is ensuing. Outside of team fights, Empower could be used for farming in lanes or jungles.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to cast Empower on ranged allies, especially if they are carries; ranged heroes like Drow Ranger or Weaver can greatly benefit from the base damage boost, since it adds more power to their already devastating auto-attacks.<br/><br/>In comparison, a Battle Fury has a cleave radius of 225, and does 35% damage. Empower has a smaller radius of 200, but deals 50% damage at its highest level. This ability can, in some cases, act as a free Battle Fury.<br/><br/>Skewer is a tricky ability to use effectively:<br/><br/>When the target is moving, determine its path ahead of time, since there is a short delay in deploying. The closer you are to the target, the sooner Skewer will land.<br/><br/>To maximize its range, always target Skewer's landing point from a distance.<br/><br/>Note that Skewer is not a disable; it does not interrupt targets from casting their spells. Skewer is more of a crippling ability used to push targets to a certain distance and slow them, making escape more difficult.<br/><br/>Always try to Skewer in front of an enemy; the farther the target is pushed away from safety, the better.<br/><br/>Though it is offensive in nature, Skewer can also act as a quick escape mechanism, functioning similarly to a slower Force Staff. You can charge toward cliffs to make it more difficult for your pursuers to chase you.<br/><br/>During the laning phase, try to Skewer enemy heroes toward your tower; they will be forced to take tower damage, giving you additional offense while fighting them.<br/><br/>Skewer placement is usually ideal when in front of a hero. This can easily be attained with a Blink Dagger, as it lets you blink in front of your enemy for an easier placement. Invisibility can also be used to your advantage, as you can easily place yourself in front of the target without their knowledge (unless of course they have methods to prevent invisibility).<br/><br/>Skewer also makes a good initiation ability; you can use it to quickly dash in the middle of multiple enemy heroes, so that you can stun all of them with Reverse Polarity.<br/><br/>Skewer has a long cooldown of 30 seconds, so make sure to use it only when you really need it; otherwise, you will lose either an escape ability, or an offensive cripple.<br/><br/>Reverse Polarity is one of the most powerful team fight disables in the game:<br/><br/>When planning to cast, place yourself in the middle of as many heroes as you can. The more heroes you disable, the more advantage you gain in the team fight.<br/><br/>The enemy targets' designated landing point make it easier for your allies to land their area-of-effect spells.<br/><br/>The pull also synergizes well with Magnus's frontal target spells. While your affected targets are stunned in front of you, you can cast Shockwave in a line, cleave with Empower, or trample them with Skewer. Note that only Skewer will displace them from the pulled location.<br/><br/>Though very powerful, Reverse Polarity's huge drawback is its cooldown. Use it carefully.<br/><br/>If possible, pave your way into an area full of enemy heroes with Skewer, then cast Reverse Polarity. Skewer's charge will help you get to the area faster, and will guarantee you stunned targets if you manage to drag heroes with you.<br/><br/>Maximize Reverse Polarity's disable with a Refresher Orb; casting Reverse Polarity>Refresh>Reverse Polarity will damage your targets for a total of 100/250/400 magic damage and disable them for 4.50/6/7.50 seconds, depending on the timing of the second cast."

As the motley warriors clashed, he shifted from form to form throughout the battle, instantly absorbing the ways of these strange creatures--now a footsoldier, now an archer, now the cavalryman--until, by the time the last soldier fell, Morphling had played every part. The battle's end was his beginning.",
      "tips": "As Morph gives +3 to both Agility and Strength with one level, it's a very strong ability to get at level 1.<br/><br/>As Adaptive Strike scales with attributes, it shouldn't be leveled until after Waveform is maxed and should be the last ability maxed out.<br/><br/>Boots of Travel is a commonly built item on Morphling. By using Replicate, then teleporting back to base, you can then instantly return to where you were with Morph Replicate. This strategy can also be used with Town Portal Scrolls.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade is the most common and recommended item for burst damage on Morphling. By Morphing points into agility, he can cause massive damage with Ether Blast, and then use the amplified magic damage to finish an enemy off with Waveform and Adaptive Strike. This is sometimes referred to as the \"Shotgun combo\". However, do not build ethereal blade if Morphling lacks farm, as this item is most effective midgame, building it too late would not be useful.<br/><br/>Sometimes deciding which hero to choose for Replicate can be difficult, however potential candidates for this spell include: a hero with high DPS, those with favorable passives (such as Axe's Counter Helix), squishy support heroes that can be used for bait, or even an enemy hero who has a Radiance or some other aura, which allows you to take advantage of receiving its effects for free.<br/><br/>Unlike most illusions in the game, the illusion created by Replicate does not take bonus damage, making it difficult to distinguish from an actual hero. You can use this to your advantage by replicating a high-priority ally and using the illusion to bait out enemy spells.<br/><br/>Morphling's early game damage is relatively high with Waveform and decent right click through Morph Agility Gain. Consider laning with an aggressive support to grab some early game kills so you can accelerate your farm and reach your late game faster.<br/><br/>Morphling functions better as a carry in teams with a strong front line. This allows him to remain in the fight with a high amount of agility and hence right click or Adaptive Strike damage, without feeling the pressure of being focused. Although he is good at soaking damage through Morph Strength and items such as Linken's Sphere and Eye of Skadi, he is much more useful as your team's primary source of consistent damage.<br/><br/>Morphling is one of the most effective split pushers in the game once he has built a Manta Style. Maximize your Agility and create hard-hitting illusions to help you push towers while you Replicate to safety<br/><br/>If you've opted for the 'Shotgun build', Manta Style will remove the Ethereal effect off yourself so you can continue right clicking other targets afterwards. This is also extremely useful against heroes with magical burst damage who will exploit the extra damage you will take in Ethereal form<br/><br/>If you're low on life and being chased/targeted, use Morph Strength Gain to increase your health and health regeneration to increase the difficulty of killing you.

      "tips": "Map awareness is especially important with Nature's Prophet. It's best to be constantly looking around the map for opportunities. Since Teleportation allows Nature's Prophet to teleport to any point on the map, he can effectively assist in ganks, or in the killing of the enemy courier. The same applies to helping allies who are in need of assistance, teleporting to an ally who is being ganked can be extremely helpful. <br/><br/>Sprouting an enemy hero and using Nature's Call will surround the target in Treants; this can be more effective offensively than simply leaving the sprouted trees for their short duration.<br/><br/>Bizarrely for an Intelligence hero, the vast majority of Nature's Prophet's damage comes from his right-click attack. It can be advisable to focus on improving attack speed and damage amplification. <br/><br/>Wrath of Nature deals more and more damage as it cuts a swath through enemy units. With each unit passed and hit, the damage increases - Try to send it through as many creeps as you can before it strikes a Hero. This generally works by targeting the spell to the Top Lane if you want maximum damage dealt to the Bottom Lane and vice versa.<br/><br/>Although risky and somewhat costly early game, Teleport can be used to \"snipe\" and possibly kill the enemies courier to give them an early disadvantage. Grab a Town Portal Scroll and some Observer Wards at the start of the game and teleport right outside the enemies fountain. Next, set down a ward, and use the scroll to head back to base/lane. You can now see whenever the enemies courier leaves the base, and determine which lane it is headed to."

   "necrophos": {
      "bio": "In a time of great plague, an obscure monk of dark inclinations, one Rotund'jere, found himself promoted to the rank of Cardinal by the swift death of all his superiors. While others of the order went out to succor the ill, the newly ordained cardinal secluded himself within the Cathedral of Rumusque, busily scheming to acquire the property of dying nobles, promising them spiritual rewards if they signed over their terrestrial domains. As the plague receded to a few stubborn pockets, his behavior came to the attention of the greater order, which found him guilty of heresy and sentenced him to serve in the plague ward, ensorcelled with spells that would ensure him a slow and lingering illness. But they had not counted on his natural immunity. Rotund'jere caught the pox, but instead of dying, found it feeding his power, transforming him into a veritable plague-mage, a Pope of Pestilence. Proclaiming himself Necrophos, he travels the world, spreading plague wherever he goes, and growing in terrible power with every village his pestilential presence obliterates.",
      "tips": "Taking one point in Heartstopper Aura in the early game allows Necrophos to harass enemy heroes by simply standing near them.<br/><br/>Note however that the aura affects enemy creeps, and thus putting points in it will push the lane. Should you lane with a farm-dependent carry, it is unwise to push as it makes their farm more difficult and leaves both of you more vulnerable to ganks. Putting one or at the most two points in it is appropriate for early game.<br/><br/>The philosophy behind Reaper's Scythe is that (owing to Sadist) it will return its mana expenditure if you secure a kill. There are several situations in which this ability should be used purely for its stun, such as interrupting channelled ultimates (such as those belonging to Pudge or Enigma) or preventing an enemy hero from escaping. Remember that the stun goes through magic immunity, although the damage will not.<br/><br/>At level 3, Reaper's Scythe will kill targets at 40% or less hp (with Aghanim's Scepter it's generally any amount under 45%). Remember to factor in Magic Resistance before you attempt to execute an enemy hero with it. <br/><br/>Aghanim's Scepter upgrades Necrophos's ultimate and will increase the damage ratio to 1.2 at max rank. To calculate the raw damage of Reaper's Scythe, multiply the missing health of an enemy by the ratio. For example, if Axe has a maximum health of 3,900 and he has lost 2,200 health, multiply 2,200 by 1.2 and the damage of Reaper's Scythe will be 2640 (ignoring Magic Resistance), which is more than lethal enough to kill him. Simply put you can kill any hero without any extra magic resistance once their HP drops to roughly half way through no matter how big their HP pool is.<br/><br/>The Reaper's Scythe instant-kill HP threshold, with the base 25% magic resist factored in and without Aghanim's Scepter, can be calculated by multiplying the enemy max health with the constants: 3/13, 9/29, or 27/67 for each respective level of the ultimate. With the Scepter, the values change to 9/29, 27/67, and 9/19. Example: If Windranger has 700 max health; 700*3/13 = 161. Id est, she must have 161 or less HP to be killed by level 1 Reaper's Scythe without Scepter.[1]<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Reaper's Scythe is not a channeling ability, meaning you can move the moment you have cast it. As such, it can be used to escape ganks and chases. However, be sure of two things before using it this way, first of all, make sure the 1.5 second stun can actually save you, and even if it can save you, consider secondly if it is worth using your powerful ultimate solely for saving yourself. Otherwise it is most likely more beneficial to your team to accept your death and save your ultimate for the next encounter.<br/><br/>Because you can cast during the stun, you can use it to initiate on an enemy hero to keep them from escaping assuming you can cause enough damage in 1.5 seconds. You can instant-kill with this tactic if you are paired with a high burst damage hero such as Huskar or Lina or Lion, or if you are in possession of a high level Dagon and an Ethereal Blade.<br/><br/>Necrophos can very easily be built as a tank and in most circumstances should be; you may gear for Strength (he does not need excessive Intelligence as his autoattack is not too useful, and Sadist refunds mana for each kill he gets). The reason he is usually built as a tank is because he needs to stay alive in violent encounters to heal his allies (a good enemy team will focus him first), and also because the longer he is alive for, the more damage his aura will do and the better chance he has of landing a crucial Reaper's Scythe.<br/><br/>Though it may be a bit wise to build some mana pool increasing items such as Point Booster or other Intelligence items anyway, because if Necrophos has used all his abilities and failed to get a kill, he can wind up unable to cast any more of his spells, and if his auto attack is not too great, getting last hits to regenerate some mana can be problematic.<br/><br/>Utility items, such as Mekansm and Pipe of Insight are more useful for Necrophos, because of Heartstopper Aura he can inflict constant damage simply by avoiding death.<br/><br/>Necrophos is effective against invisible heroes that tend to stalk their prey as his Heartstopper Aura does damage while they are in stealth, his Death Pulse hits invisible units, and his Reaper's Scythe will prevent them from escaping via invisibility before they die. He is also very good against heroes with abilities that deplete their own HP such as Pudge, Slark, and Centaur Warrunner (Huskar is an exception since his Berserker's Blood will almost always prevent you from killing him with Reaper's Scythe), but Necrophos should first be durable enough to take on these kinds of risk/reward heroes.<br/><br/>Necrophos's role is notoriously debated; while his abilities appear supportive at their core, his Reaper's Scythe is a tool used to secure kills only for himself (much like Axe's Culling Blade). This is atypical for a standard support hero, because supports usually attempt to confer gold and experience to the team's carry. The duplicity of his carry/support role stems from his unique stance in encounters; his kit is largely supportive until an enemy hero grows weak, at which point Necrophos has the capacity to kill said enemy himself. He is best viewed as a utility focused semicarry, rather than a full fledged support hero, in a similar vein to heroes like Tidehunter or Windranger. <br/><br/>Necrophos is best described as a tank carry/support hybrid as he builds support items and has a healing ability yet these items give him extremely strong team presence during a team fight. The idea behind this as mentioned is that the longer Necrophos stays alive the more damage his enemies suffer due to his aura and spamming of his first ability that both damages all enemies nearby and heals allies at the same time. With a Mekansm and Pipe of Insight and the low cooldown of his first ability Necrophos becomes exceedingly hard to bring down unless focused with stuns and disables which in turn leaves your teammates free to offer their own abilities to the fight. <br/><br/>Necrophos is countered in lane by any hero with high HP regeneration, such as Dragon Knight and Quas-focused Invoker, or a hero with lifesteal capabilities; because he relies on inflicting constant, gradual damage with Death Pulse and Heartstopper Aura. Heroes with these attributes will resist this in lane against Necrophos, keeping high enough HP to prevent death by Reaper's Scythe.<br/><br/>As Necrophos's survivability heavily relies on his ability to spam Death Pulse you need to be wary of heroes with silence such as Drow Ranger, Silencer and Death Prophet. Ancient Apparition can also greatly cripple you with Ice Blast as this ability prevents HP from regenerating for an extended period of time.<br/><br/>Dagon is more useful on Necrophos than other heroes because it not only deals burst damage, but also allows you to quickly deal more damage from your ultimate.<br/><br/>Ethereal Blade can be used in conjunction with Reaper's Scythe and Death Pulse to deal significantly more damage. If you are also in a possession of a high level Dagon, a quick Reaper's Scythe to Ether Blast to Energy Burst combo can decimate full health enemy heroes with total health points lower than 2000, assuming they have the standard 25% magic resistance. It is worth noting that Ether Blast temporarily increases the magical damage dealt per missing health from the standard ( 0.4/0.6/0.9 (0.6/0.9/1.2*) ) to ( 0.56/0.84/1.26 (0.84/1.26/1.68*) ) thus also increases the instant-kill threshold.<br/><br/>Assuming a level 5 Energy Burst and a level 3 Reaper's Scythe with an Aghanim's Scepter is used against an enemy with 25% magic resistance while being ethereal, you will deal 840 damage from Dagon and 1058.4 damage from Reaper's Scythe, to a total of 1898.4 damage (not including damage from Ether Blast and Reaper's Scythe damage due to it). If the match reaches the late-game, you still can burst down a full health non-magic-immune enemy carry with standard magic resistance during teamfights, potentially turning it into your team's favor.<br/><br/>Necrophos can be a viable choice when you decide an aggressive trilane and the enemy has a tanky offlaner, so that their health slowly drains and may reach a level when you and your allies can subdue and kill the enemy."

There are ancient tales woven into the lore of every race and every culture, of an impossible time before sunlight and daytime, when night reigned alone and the world was covered with the creatures of darkness-creatures like Balanar the Night Stalker. <br/><br/>It is said that on the dawn of the First Day, all the night creatures perished. All, that is, save one. Evil's embodiment, Night Stalker delights in his malevolence. He created the primal role of the Night Terror, the Boogeyman, and as long as there have been younglings, his is the specter summoned to terrify them. This is a role he relishes-nor are these empty theatrics. He does indeed stalk the unwary, the defenseless, those who have strayed beyond the lighted paths or denied the warnings of their communities. Night Stalker serves as living proof that every child's worst nightmare....is true.",
      "tips": "Void is the best ability to max early, as the damage increase and slow allow you to use it to kill your desired target.<br/><br/>Hunter in the Night empowers his attack speed and movement speed superbly during the night, making him the best ganker during the earliest parts of the game.<br/><br/>Night Stalker will greatly benefit from being on the same team as a Luna. Her Lunar Blessing will give him bonus damage and her Eclipse will turn the time of the day to night for 10 seconds. This 10 seconds is often significant enough for the Night Stalker to set in and go for the kill.<br/><br/>Using Darkness during night time will prolong the duration of the night, allowing Night Stalker to ultimately change the time to his favor.<br/><br/>During the night, most heroes have below average vision, rendering them to be ineffective on chases and gives enemies a chance to hide in a blind spot. Night Stalker, however, is at home in this time and has full vision, allowing him to effectively chase without getting obscured on his sight. With Aghanim's Scepter, he gains full unobstructed vision, allowing him to see through trees,higher terrains and even inside Roshan Pit.<br/><br/>Satanic and Helm of the Dominator can be used to help Night Stalker jungle in the mid game stage and the active of Satanic will aid him in healing a lot of damage if he has to face the enemy carry during a manfight.<br/><br/>Vladmir's Offering helps greatly with pushing towers after a successful gank and provides a vampiric aura to your allies.<br/><br/>During the day, save Darkness for when it is necessary for a fight; during the night, however, cast it whenever it is off cooldown in order to maximize the night's duration."

      "bio": "Deep in the Archive of Ultimyr, shelved between scholarly treatises on dragon cladistics and books of untranslatable spells, there is an ancient tome of entomological curiosities. Compiled by scholars, the book describes the telepathic talents of the zealot scarab, a strange species of social insect with abilities unique to all the seven planes. <br/><br/>Unlike most grubs of his colony, Nyx Assassin did not arise from metamorphosis with the plodding thoughts and blunted appendages common to the worker caste of his kind. For his was a special transformation, guided by the grace of Nyx. He was the chosen one, selected from the many and anointed with an extract of the queen goddess herself. Not all survive the dark blessing of the queen's chamber, but he emerged with a penetrating mind, and dagger-like claws--his razor sharp mandibles raking the air while his thoughts projected directly into the minds of those around him. Of all zealot scarabs, he alone was selected for the highest calling. After his metamorphosis, he was reborn, by grace of Nyx, with abilities which shaped him for one thing and one thing only: to kill in the name of his goddess.",
      "tips": "As Vendetta's invisibility dispels only when your attack connects the enemy, it is nearly always best to deal your backstab damage before your Impale and Mana Burn follow-up.<br/><br/>Use Spiked Carapace only just before your Impale's stun times out, so as to reduce the enemy's chances of noticing the effect and holding back their counterattacks until the Carapace expires.<br/><br/>If you know that you are targeted for a delayed or long-range nuke (such as Sniper's Assassinate or Invoker's Sun Strike), it can be a good idea to purposefully time your Spiked Carapace to reflect the incoming damage. This will aid your team by disabling or even killing the caster. Spiked Carapace makes Nyx a good counter for Keeper of the Light through the early-mid game.<br/><br/>Vendetta's fade time into invisibility is instant, and can be used to dodge many spells provided the enemy does not possess True Sight.<br/><br/>It can sometimes be necessary to not use Vendetta to open ganks or fights, leaving the spell to chase down a fleeing enemy with the high speed boost. Vendetta is also a great escape mechanism if need be.<br/><br/>Spiked Carapace is arguably one of the best defensive abilities in the game that when used properly can disrupt whole teams and save you from many deaths despite your low health pool. Sometimes it might be a good idea to max it before your Mana Burn as the increased stun duration will come in handy when combined with your Impale. <br/><br/>Due to its scaling Mana Burn becomes more powerful as the game progresses as it reduces the mana and damages its target based on their intelligence. High intelligence gaining heroes with low health pools such as Pugna, Enigma, Silencer make excellent targets later in the game.<br/><br/>When the ultimate is level 3, use it when the cooldown is at 1 seconds remaining, so you can attack the enemy and stun him, then fade again and attack it another time."

      "bio": "The ordinary ogre is the creature for whom the phrase 'As dumb as a bag of rock hammers' was coined. In his natural state, an ogre is supremely incapable of doing or deciding anything. Clothed in dirt, he sometimes finds himself accidentally draped in animal skins after eating lanekill. Not an especially social creature, he is most often found affectionately consorting with the boulders or tree-stumps he has mistaken for kin (a factor that may explain the ogre's low rate of reproduction). However, once every generation or so, the ogre race is blessed with the birth of a two-headed Ogre Magi, who is immediately given the traditional name of Aggron Stonebreak, the name of the first and perhaps only wise ogre in their line's history. With two heads, Ogre Magi finds it possible to function at a level most other creatures manage with one. And while the Ogre Magi will win no debates (even with itself), it is graced with a divine quality known as Dumb Luck--a propensity for serendipitous strokes of fortune which have allowed the ogre race to flourish in spite of enemies, harsh weather, and an inability to feed itself. It's as if the Goddess of Luck, filled with pity for the sadly inept species, has taken Ogre Magi under her wing. And who could blame her? Poor things.",
      "tips": "Fireblast gives the full 1.5s of stun from the first level, whereas Ignite gains significant additional slow and duration with levels. However, Fireblast will deal high damage if it's leveled and Multi Cast occurs, so choose your ability build wisely.<br/><br/>It may seem wise to delay leveling Multi Cast to preserve the mana efficiency of Fireblast, but remember that Ignite has no area-of-effect until there is at least one level in your Ultimate. This makes farming and pushing creep waves much more difficult. By delaying Multi Cast, you'll be delaying your farming effectiveness which can put you behind for the rest of the game. For most games, the utility of AOE damage makes higher mana costs an acceptable trade-off. Consider the state of the game and your situation when deciding whether to level Multi Cast at 6.<br/><br/>When you have at least 1 point in Multi Cast, use Ignite when the enemies get clumped to affect them all in a short radius.<br/><br/>Bloodlust is a rather versatile ability, allowing you or anyone you cast it on to make a swift escape or entrance during teamfights, as well as being a powerful steroid for any carry. Consider keeping your Bloodlust always on a carry during a teamfight.<br/><br/>You're a good chaser: your Fireblast can stun an enemy for 1.5 seconds and keep him in place, while your Ignite damages and slows the target. Use these abilities to help your teammates get kills."

   "omniknight": {
      "bio": "Purist Thunderwrath was a hard-fighting, road-worn, deeply committed knight, sworn to the order in which he had grown up as squire to elder knights of great reputation. He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt.",
      "tips": "Omniknight usually purchases a Mekansm and Arcane Boots to continually have heals during team fights and lane pushes.<br/><br/>Other slows are able to stack on top of your Degen Aura so it is fairly common to purchase a Shiva's Guard to be able to slow your opponents down even more than what you normally could.<br/><br/>If you are attempting to save an ally from death, use Purification before using Repel on them, because Repel will prevent you from using Purification on them.<br/><br/>You can use Purification to deal a lot of damage early on, or even causing first blood, especially at level 3 and 5.<br/><br/>Repel can be used on enemies, you could use this to great effect if you want to for example single out a priority target while your teams Naga Siren has used her Song of the Siren. (Keep in mind you must use repel before song, as all heroes are invulnerable to both buffs and debuffs while affected by the song.)<br/><br/>Repel can completely block the effects of some ultimates, an example being Tidehunter's Ravage.<br/><br/>Guardian Angel can turn the tide of many battles! Don't be too shy when deciding when to use it.<br/><br/>Attacking an enemy who is running from you can give them time to escape Degen Aura. To keep them slowed, run with them instead. Try to get ahead of them if possible. Then you can hit them or heal while blocking their path.<br/><br/>Omniknight's ultimate is very effective against any ability that deals physical damage; for example, it can be used to negate Juggernaut's Omnislash.<br/><br/>If you have to initiate, use Repel on the carry first, then activate your Guardian Angel. This will give your team the upper hand in a teamfight."

   "oracle": {
      "bio": "Ascendants to the Great Seat of Cymurri had for ages imported their Oracles exclusively from the Ivory Incubarium, high in the hollow peaks of the Zealot's Range, with a downpayment made at the time of the embryo's conception and the balance surrendered on delivery of a mature, well-trained prophet to the Gate of the Graven King. Raised by same Pallid Sybils who bred and birthed them, all sanctioned Oracles were anchored by their physical form to the world we most of us share; meanwhile, their souls roamed far afield, barely bound by the airiest astral umbilicus. From such cosmic roamings the prophets would return, speaking words of fire with tongues of flesh. Their mystic utterances were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors, who found in them visions of the future, diplomatic advice, all the supernatural ammunition the line of Graven Kings needed to secure victory in every campaign, whether in the court or on the battlefield. Thus it went for generations, the Graventome's pages filling with the names of triumphant kings and the new domains they had acquired. So it went, that is, until the particular Oracle named Nerif arrived to serve the very last of the stone-helmed kings.  From the first, Nerif's prophecies were unusual. They seemed not merely to portend the future, but to shape it. The weird soothsayer croaked out advice no one had requested, and suddenly the Cymurri found themselves immersed in conflicts with newfound enemies. The Advisors, sensing a threat to their power, were quick to pin these unwelcome developments on the latest Oracle. They demanded his removal, petitioning the Sybils to reclaim their defective prophet and replace him with a worthy substitute. But Nerif described an ominous dream of the Incubarium's destruction, and within hours came news of the ancient school's destruction in a catastrophic avalanche. Fearing the same fate as the Pallid Sybils, the Advisors withdrew to their counsel chambers, suddenly anxious to avoid the Oracle's notice. The Graven King, however, was a creature of great practicality. He doubted the commitment of his overprudent Advisors. An Oracle of such rarity, he reasoned, ought be used as a weapon to enlarge his domain. He therefore demoted his timid counselors and stationed Nerif at his side. With only a blunt understanding of Nerif's talent, he boldly stated the outcomes he desired, and coaxed Nerif into uttering his wishes as prophecy.  At first, all was well. The Last Graven King boasted that by adopting Fate's pet, he had made a plaything of Fate itself. He should have taken it as a warning then when, on the eve of his invasion of the Unsated Satrap's realm, he attempted to coerce a prediction of certain victory from his Oracle, only to hear Nerif quietly mutter, \"It could go either way.\" No firmer statement could he force from Nerif's lips. Still, the King was confident in his army. The Satrapy was landlocked, poorly armed, and shut off from all possible allies. He took \"It could go either way\" to indicate that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his plan.  Of course, we now know that he should have taken the sayer's words more literally. Even with careful study of the Annotated Annals of If, what happened on the field before the Unsated Satrap's palace is almost impossible to visualize. It appears that in the midst of the carnage, the battle began to bifurcate. At each pivotal moment, reality calved and broke into bits. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also stood sure-footed, forging onward to fight. Their minds also split; the warriors found themselves both dead and alive, existent and non-existent. Victory and defeat were partitioned, so that each separate outcome was experienced in simultaneity by both armies. The universe became a hall of mirrors, with all the mirrors endlessly shattering.  The immediate effect on both parties was insanity. Unable to comprehend the state of being both triumphant and defeated, the Graven King's mind dispersed into motes of madness. The naive Satrap fared no better. The opposing paired realities continued to split and split again, echoing into infinite histories, all of them populated by a bewildered populace that soon lost the ability to feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner.  Long before the repercussions had played out, however, Cymurri's wary Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever. It was, of course, too late for them. And may well be for us.",
      "tips": "All of Oracle's spells have great direct synergy with each other. The initial damage from Purifying Flames is fully blocked by the 100% magic resistance from Fate's Edict, turning it into a strong heal for allies. Other sources do bonus damage though, so it can backfire if timed poorly. Purifying Flames is purgeable, so Fortune's End can remove the healing effect of it, turning it into a strong instant nuke with no heal for enemies. False Promise doubles all healing received during it, including the healing of Purifying Flames, making it heal a total of 198/216/324/432 health if the spell's damage is taken into account. False Promise, Fate's Edict and Purifying Flames together on one ally effectively makes it heal for 198/396/594/792 health once the ultimate expires, since the damage is blocked by the 100% magic resistance and the heal doubled by the ultimate. Fate's Edict in combination with Ghost Scepter, Ethereal Blade or Decrepify can grant a hero 100% magic resistance and 100% resistance against physical damage, so only pure damage is able to harm them. Owing to the fact that Oracle has the lowest natural base attack time in the game (surpassed only by Alchemist after he achieves the second level of his ult), Oracle can actually be a formidable auto-attacking hero. Keep in mind that while Oracle's healing potential is great with the right items, as seen above, he needs to pull off various spell combos to be truly effective. Although the mana costs of his abilities are moderate, with their low cooldown all of his combos are almost spammable. Without cost-effective easy build-up mana regen items like Orchid Malevolence, Eul's Scepter of Divinity, you will find yourself with no mana and not being useful very often in the mid-game."

From this jagged crystalline Outworld, forever on guard, he has gazed for eternities into the heavens, alert for any stirring in the bottomless night beyond the stars. Imprinted deep in the shining lattices of his intellect lies a resonant pattern akin to prophecy, a dark music implying that eventually some evil will wake out there, beyond the edges of creation, and turn its attention to our world. With his whole being focused on his vigil, Outworld Devourer paid little attention to events closer in to the sun. But at last the clamor of the Ancients, and a sense of growing threat from within as well as without, sent him winging sunward to visit the plains of war. Harbinger's place in our own prophecies is unambiguous: he must be considered an omen of worse things to come. But his arrival in itself is bad enough. ",
      "tips": "One of Harbinger's significant weaknesses is his fragility. Avoid taking in too much damage; if so, you will miss out on potential gold and experience, as well as put your team in danger by not dealing the needed extra damage against your enemies. Try to fight in the sidelines, or when your enemies are too busy to attack you. His defense can be boosted through items, but make sure not to deprive him of too much intelligence. <br/><br/>Try to level up as much as possible in the early stages of the game, be it from farming or killing other heroes. The more you advance in level, the more Intelligence and gold you will receive. The more Intelligence and gold you receive, the better you will dominate in the mid and later game. OD is extremely powerful in the later game, provided he farms well in the laning phase.<br/><br/>Level up Harbinger's Essence Aura as soon as possible so that he can quickly solve his mana problems right away. Essence Aura can also make a good support ability for your allies, especially if they rely heavily on casting spells.<br/><br/>Astral Imprisonment is Harbinger's disabling ability, and can be used in both offensive and defensive ways.<br/><br/> It can be used to delay enemy heroes you are laning against, giving you more time to either deny or last-hit creeps.<br/><br/>It can also be used to buy time, be it escaping or trying to chase an enemy. While escaping, you can cast it on yourself or any dying ally to shift the enemy's focus away. While chasing, you can step ahead of the imprisoned enemy's path and make it harder for them to escape.<br/><br/>Use Astral Imprisonment carefully against your enemies when your allies are present in the team fight. Using it too much in these situations can potentially block your allies' spells, especially if they are channeling disables (i.e. Pudge's Dismember). Use it when your teammates are out of disables, or when the enemies are in the process of escaping. As well, try to target other units that are currently not disabled or crippled by your teammates.<br/><br/> When Harbinger's Essence Aura is high enough (at least Level 3), you can keep casting Arcane Orb against enemy targets to restore his mana right away if depleted.<br/><br/>Casting Sanity's Eclipse can prove important when a team fight starts, since it can shut down spell-reliant casters by burning 75% of their mana, as well as soften strength and agility heroes. Keep in mind that your intelligence must be at least marginally higher than theirs so that the effects can work.<br/><br/>Outworld Devourer has no reliable escape until he gets a Force Staff. Frequent early ganks can put him at a severe disadvantage. Protection (laning with a support) is recommended.<br/><br/>In team fights, Astral Imprisonment can be used to shut down a key enemy character, such as a durable carry like Life Stealer, so your team can focus on squishier supports. As Sanity's Eclipse can be used on imprisoned enemies, it may be preferable to initiate by imprisoning and immediately ulting the same target."

      "bio": "Through a process of divination, children are selected for upbringing by the Sisters of the Veil, an order that considers assassination a sacred part of the natural order. The Veiled Sisters identify targets through meditation and oracular utterances. They accept no contracts, and never seem to pursue targets for political or mercenary reasons. Their killings bear no relation to any recognizable agenda, and can seem to be completely random: A figure of great power is no more likely to be eliminated than a peasant or a well digger. Whatever pattern the killings may contain, it is known only to them. They treat their victims as sacrifices, and death at their hand is considered an honor. Raised with no identity except that of their order, any Phantom Assassin can take the place of any other; their number is not known. Perhaps there are many, perhaps there are few. Nothing is known of what lies under the Phantom Veil. Except that this one, from time to time, when none are near enough to hear, is known to stir her veils with the forbidden whisper of her own name: Mortred.",
      "tips": "Stifling Dagger has multiple uses. It should generally be the first ability maxed, as it allows you to last hit creeps from a distance. It also allows you to harass the enemy, though do be aware of the relatively high mana cost in the early game as Mortred has an extremely small mana pool. <br/><br/>If enemies have fallen back in lane to use a Clarity or a Healing Salve, Stifling Dagger can be used to disable the regeneration effects.<br/><br/>Phantom Strike can target both allies and enemies. Jumping to a friendly unit can be useful if Mortred needs to escape.<br/><br/>A single point in blur early on can be beneficial in the laning stage. It can be a good idea to max it in the early game if the enemy are being especially aggressive.<br/><br/>Choosing to build whether attack speed or attack damage is up to the player's decision. Building more attack speed increases the chance of Coup de Grace to proc, although the critical damage will not be too high. Building attack damage will greatly increase Mortred's damage, but attacking too slow will mean proccing Coup de Grace will be a rare event. Keep in mind that Mortred gains 3.15 agility per level, and that Phantom Strike increases Mortred's attack speed for a few moments. This means if you are scaling up well and you are higher level than your opponents, building attack damage is the better choice. If Mortred is underleveled due to constant ganks or the enemy having a lot of disables, building attack speed is better, so you can proc a few more critical hits before retreating or dying. Because of this, Phantom Strike can be used as an escape mechanism as opposed to damage output if it is not sufficient level to be use effectively. <br/><br/>Be very wary of enemies using Blade Mail, as Mortred's damage output is many times greater than her health pool, though with a Black King Bar you can alleviate the issue if the enemy does build a Blade Mail.<br/><br/>A Ghost Scepter or Ethereal Blade heavily counters Mortred's main damage output, physical damage. Acquiring a Diffusal Blade will help purge the ethereal protection and leave the enemy vulnerable.<br/><br/>During the early game, a highly leveled Blur coupled with a Poor Man's Shield will make Mortred extremely resistant to physical damage as she has naturally high base armor as well. Use this to your advantage by melee harassing enemies who lack burst magical damage, reliable escape mechanisms or powerful disables.<br/><br/>Getting an Empower buff from Magnus while having a Battlefury in your inventory will boost Mortred's cleave damage to 85%. Use this to completely destroy enemies who are closely grouped together!"

      "bio": "The remote village of Pole had no knowledge of the wars raging in the heart of the kingdom. For them, the quiet of spear fishing, and a family meal were all that a full life required. Yet war came for them nonetheless. Joining the able-bodied conscripts as they filed passed their homes, the humble lancer Azwraith vowed to bring peace to his kingdom, and in so doing, his people. Placed with his kin in the vanguard of the final assault against the Dread Magus Vorn, the cost to his fellows was absolute. As the charging force battled toward the fortress, Azwraith alone among his kind remained standing, and he alone was able to infiltrate the keep. Focused and infuriated by the slaughter of his brothers, Azwraith bested each of the wizard's deadly traps and conjured guardians. Soon the simple fisherman arrived at Vorn's tower sanctum. The pair dueled through the night, pike to staff, as chaos raged below, and with a deafening cry Azwraith pierced his enemy. But the wizard did not simply expire; he exploded into uncountable shards of light, penetrating his killer with power. As the dust settled and the smoke of combat began to clear, Azwraith found himself standing among a throng of his kin. Each seemed to be dressed as he was, each seemed armed as he was, and he could sense that each thought as he did. Aware that his allies were approaching, he willed these phantoms to hide themselves, and one by one they began to vanish into nothingness. As the soldiers came upon the sanctum, they found the warrior that had bested the wizard. When they approached their champion, the lancer vanished. The pikeman who had stood before them was no more than another phantom.",
      "tips": "It is good to get a lot of attack speed later on when your Juxtapose clones become viable so that you have a higher chance of creating a mirror image.<br/><br/>Don't neglect Strength. It is easy to build all Agility. However, that leaves him open to easy ganks.<br/><br/>Taking Juxtapose too early will leave Phantom Lancer at a great disadvantage, especially since his attack speed is too low for it to proc at a reliable rate.<br/><br/>Phantom Lancer's early game mana pool is very low, so it is recommended for him to take multiple levels of Doppelwalk early in the game unless using a soul ring build.<br/><br/>Phantom Edge gives Phantom Lancer some magic resistance. Because of this, it's considered a better choice to take it over Juxtapose when possible.<br/><br/>Illusions are counted as Heroes in a target check. However, they receive effects intended for units. An example is Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, which will stun Phantom Lancer's illusions by 5 seconds. Even with this fact, Hero-only spells like Doombringer's LVL? Death can be casted on images.<br/><br/>Watch out for Earthshaker! His Echo Slam also generates an echo for every illusion.<br/><br/>Creating confusion for your enemies is what the Phantom Lancer is all about! Use illusions to cause unnecessary chases, wasted Meat Hooks, pointless ultimates, and frustration for your enemy! Be careful to pay attention to the real Phantom Lancer for whatever he's doing while your clones run around, however!<br/><br/>Illusions can have Shallow Grave cast on them if a Dazzle is on your team; you can further fool your enemy by making them chase the wrong Phantom Lancer<br/><br/>Often times, you're better off using your Doppelwalk illusion to scout for enemy heroes lurking around in the forests early game instead of trying to use it to farm creeps.<br/><br/>When choosing an item build, remember that not all passive abilities are shared with illusions."

      "bio": "Alone across an untouched darkness gleamed the Keeper's first sun, a singular point of conscious light fated to spread warmth into the empty void. Through aeons beyond count, this blinding beacon set to coalescing its incalculable energy before bursting forth the cataclysmic flare of supernova. From this inferno raced new beacons, star progeny identical to its parent, who journeyed an unlit ocean and settled in constellatory array. In time, they too would be made to propagate through supernova flame. So would this dazzling cycle of birth and rebirth repeat until all skies hewn of Titan toil deigned to twinkle and shine.<br/><br/>By this ageless crucible the star that mortals would come to call Phoenix collapsed into being, and like its ancestors was thrust into an endless cosmos to find a place among its stellar brethren. Yet curiosity toward that which the dimming elders comfort in the darkness consumed the fledgling, and so over long cycles it inquired and studied. It learned that among worlds both whole and broken would soon stir a nexus of remarkable variety locked in an enduring conflict of cosmic consequence, a plane which would find itself in need of more influence than a dying sun's distant rays could provide. Thus this infant son of suns took terrestrial form, eagerly travelling to shine its warmth upon those who may need it most, and perhaps seize upon its solar destiny.",
      "tips": "Since most of Phoenix's abilities cost a percentage of his health to activate, health regeneration items are very useful. Urn of Shadows, Mekansm, Pipe of Insight and Heart of Tarrasque are good examples of such items.<br/><br/>It's very helpful to prioritize a Shiva's Guard as your first or second major purchase, as its passive attack slow works during Supernova. With a bit of timing, you can also use Shiva's while Icarus Diving for a long ranged AOE disable.<br/><br/>Buying Eul's Scepter of Divinity can sometimes be a good investment, as you can still Sun Ray while under the effects of Eul's, and you can use it while diving to disable an enemy from a long distance.<br/><br/>Fire Spirit's attack speed reduction is great to mess up the enemies' last hits. Also, if used right before Supernova, it will make killing the sun harder.<br/><br/>Phoenix can be used both as a semi-carry and a support. If going for the former, take the mid lane and buy items to make you harder to kill. If you're supporting, consider going for cheap healing items such as Tranquil Boots, Urn of Shadows and a Mekansm.<br/><br/>You can go to the area around Roshan's pit and use Sun Ray to quickly and safely check if the enemy team is fighting Roshan.<br/><br/>You can give your team a significant initiation advantage by flying over the enemy team with Icarus Dive and rapidly covering the area in Fire Spirits. Fire Spirits will be easier to land from close proximity, but their high range can also allow you to hit spread-out team members. While the enemy team's movement and attack speed has been slowed, Supernova is a much more effective ability.<br/><br/>If you are confident about your team's follow-up, you may be able to soak up some extra damage before using your ultimate, thus relying on your team rather than your own short-lived disables to protect the Supernova. If you're less confident, you can continue the Icarus Dive to a point where Supernova can still affect some enemies, but to eliminate it the enemy heroes will have to slowly run towards you and your team and ignore the latter if they still intend to focus you. If you're not confident at all, you can resume support with your Sun Ray instead of using Supernova since the Icarus Dive will return you to your original position by default.<br/><br/>Magic Stick and Magic Wand are even more effective on Phoenix than most other heroes because his abilities cost both HP and mana, decreasing scenarios where you only use the items to gain just enough mana for casting an ability."

   "puck": {
      "bio": "While Puck seems at first glance a mischievous, childish character, this quality masks an alien personality. The juvenile form of a Faerie Dragon, a creature that lives for eons, Puck spends countless millennia in its childish form. So while it is technically true that Puck is juvenile, it will continue to be so when the cities of the present age have sloughed away into dust. Its motives are therefore inscrutable, and what appears to be play may in fact hide a darker purpose. Its endless fondness for mischief is the true indicator of Puck's true nature.",
      "tips": "Puck needs a solo lane in order to capitalize on its powerful abilities, and can easily play alone even against a dual lane because of Ethereal Jaunt and Illusory Orb.<br/><br/>Puck should generally go mid, as Puck is highly elusive in solo lanes and as such will keep the enemy's midgame carry/ganker busy longer; as well as the easy access to the sidelanes for ganking that mid grants. Puck also burns mana very quickly and as such will require a bottle and runes to sustain its lane.<br/><br/>When escaping from danger, always Phase Shift after you use Illusory Orb. This way, you can sit invulnerable and wait for the orb to travel before you slip away.<br/><br/>The Blink Dagger is the perfect item to get on Puck, as it helps with initiating and escaping in addition to the many escape methods that Puck has.<br/><br/>With a Level 4 Phase Shift and Blink Dagger, Puck can escape many dangerous situations with quick hands or queuing up spells. It is important to note, however, that Puck must still turn to cast abilities while phase shifted. Blinking out, for instance, can be very difficult if you wish to escape in the opposite direction, particularly if damage over time effects are active. <br/><br/>Puck's turn speed is among the lowest of all heroes.<br/><br/>Phase Shift can be used to avoid physical effects like Pudge's Hook.<br/><br/>An effective Puck player uses tricks and mind games on opponents. One such example is casting Illusory Orb, running in a different direction to where you cast it, then teleporting to it.<br/><br/>Mix Puck with a hero like Chen and you can use an Illusory Orb, then have Chen teleport you back to base to refill your bottle without leaving lane. Use Ethereal Jaunt to the orb before it disappears. <br/><br/>If you die while Illusory Orb is mid-air, you could buyback and use Ethereal Jaunt to the orb to enter the battle.<br/><br/>Should you have a Blink Dagger, the ideal initiation combo is to blink in a group of enemies, Waning Rift, Dream Coil, shoot an Illusory Orb through as many enemies as possible but in a safe direction, Phase Shift, then use Ethereal Jaunt to teleport to the Orb. The silence from Waning Rift is more than long enough to execute this combination.<br/><br/>Waning Rift is your most important ability in late-game, as its silence is a huge boon to your team.<br/><br/>Force Staff is an alternative for Blink Dagger. It has half the escape range, but is not subject to the 3 seconds penalty for being hit. It is harder to target than blink dagger, but it is more versatile, since it can be used on allies and enemies as well. It is 100 gold more expensive, have a higher cd and costs 25 mana per cast (instead of 0), but it provides +10 intelligence, and +3 HP regen. In addition, the Push effect can be used to force break your Dream Coil on an enemy hero to deliver more damage and stun, making all the more useful.<br/><br/>If you choose to purchase a Dagon and find yourself carrying, or your team already have enough initiation but are lacking in damage, purchasing an Ethereal Blade is a possible option, as it allows Puck to deal massive damage to an enemy carry with its multitude of spells and a Dagon, and prevents the targeted hero from autoattacking which may disable Blink Dagger. Take care to avoid magical damage while under the effects, as you suffer from the effects of Ethereal as well. This can be counteracted with good Phase Shift timing."

In this cursed realm, nothing can decay or decompose; no corpse may ever return to the earth from which it sprang, no matter how deep you dig the grave. Flocked by carrion birds who need him to cut their meals into beak-sized chunks, Pudge the Butcher hones his skills with blades that grow sharper the longer he uses them. Swish, swish, thunk. Flesh falls from the bone; tendons and ligaments part like wet paper. And while he always had a taste for the butchery, over the ages, Pudge has developed a taste for its byproduct as well. Starting with a gobbet of muscle here, a sip of blood there...before long he was thrusting his jaws deep into the toughest of torsos, like a dog gnawing at rags. Even those who are beyond fearing the Reaper, fear the Butcher.",
      "tips": "Meat Hook to Rot to Dismember is the standard combo.<br/><br/>Meat Hook is hard to master but extremely versatile; it can be used to:<br/><br/>Pull a fleeing enemy into a gank, or back into one if they blinked away.<br/><br/>Pull a lone hero into your team to make any resulting teamfight 4v5.<br/><br/>Pull an allied hero out of a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>However, in case the enemy has some sort of AoE initiation ability (Echo Slam, Epicenter, Requiem of Souls, Sanity's Eclipse etc.), it's usually better to avoid hooking at all to start teamfight, lest you set up a perfect initiation for the other team. The reason is after you hook someone and your team converge on you to kill the target, you will act as a beacon for those abilities, especially if they have a Blink Dagger.<br/><br/>An easy way to land a Meat Hook is to walk up to your enemy slow him with Rot and finish him off with a Meat hook, while they are slowed.<br/><br/>Hiding spots and hooking positions: [1].<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to use Rot to escape from a chasing melee hero. Toggle it quickly on and off to apply the speed debuff to them, with minimal damage to yourself.<br/><br/>If you are Dismembering and have not used Meat Hook, make sure to not shift queue it because it can easily be dodged by running to the left or right.<br/><br/>If you have Aghanim's Scepter and are low on health you can Dismember a creep to quickly restore a lot of HP.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger can be bought on Pudge. If you hook a unit onto an unpathable ledge, the unit gains free pathing for 5 seconds.<br/><br/>Pudge can use Rot to deny himself, committing suicide and preventing the other team from receiving gold and experience for his death; killing himself in this way does not, however, reset his killing spree, resulting in the other team receiving more gold for killing him if he continues his spree.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the range on Flesh Heap is relatively small. However, you will still gain a charge by killing a foe out of range if the final blow is delivered by Meat Hook (i.e. with Meat Hook damage). This is the only exception to the Flesh Heap range restriction, as you will not gain charges by killing enemies out of range with others methods, such as with Urn of Shadows or Dagon. Therefore, you should use these methods in last resort only, when impossible to last hit an escaping enemy with Meat Hook (because of mana or creeps blocking the path for example).<br/><br/>Due to Pudge's gank-heavy playstyle, an Urn of Shadows is useful for providing health regeneration. <br/><br/>A Black King Bar is also a frequent item choice, as it can prevent enemies from interrupting Dismember channeling, as well as preventing self-damage from Rot.<br/><br/>Use Rot after casting Meat Hook if there is an enemy Rubick, as he can use the Hook against your team, who may not expect to be hooked at all."

   "pugna": {
      "bio": "In the realm of Pugna's birth, near the vents of the Nether Reaches, there stood a lamasery devoted to the Arts of Oblivion, which drew its power from the nether energies. The Grandmaster of the temple compound had himself passed into Oblivion several years prior, leaving his academy without a leader. From the moment of their master's death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master's reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children. Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama's, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying 'Mine!' The regents hoisted the beaming Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their grandmaster's vestments, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change. Within five years, the temple itself was another pile of ash, which pleased Pugna to no end.",
      "tips": "Make sure Nether Blast is always maxed first.<br/><br/>Last hit the tower with Nether Blast if it's at risk of being denied.<br/><br/>When Blasting the tower, try to hit both lane creeps and any heroes around the radius to maximize the damage to mana ratio.<br/><br/>Always use Nether Ward during team clashes. It costs a mere 80 mana and can often deal more damage than Zeus's ultimate during fights. However, it is easily destroyed, so cast the ward in hard-to-spot places to avoid an early detection from the enemy focus fire.<br/><br/>While it is a bit risky to use, given the 80 gold bounty at level 4, Nether Ward can be used to bait greedy heroes to get a little closer to your team, and start a teamfight.<br/><br/>Pugna's HP and armor are among the lowest in DotA 2, so it is wise to buff him up a bit by buying items like a Mekansm, a Bracer or an Urn of Shadows.<br/><br/>In a tight spot, Pugna can cast Decrepify on himself and teleport back to base with a scroll. This trick works best when being chased by heroes that can't nuke you and are trying to auto-attack. <br/><br/>Decrepify can be used to amplify magical damage from spells and items. Items like Dagon, Shiva's Guard, and even Ethereal Blade can be purchased to blast enemies to oblivion.<br/><br/>Decrepify protects against the following physical-damage abilities (provided the enemy has no magical orb effect item like Desolator, Mjollnir, or Maelstrom ). You can bait out these ultimates & stuns if you're in a 1v1 situation: <br/><br/>Juggernaut's Omnislash (ultimate)<br/><br/>Slardar's Slithereen Crush (AoE stun)<br/><br/>Razor's Eye of the Storm (ultimate)<br/><br/>Hitting a Nether Blast together with only Level 1 Decrepify may seem hard, so utilizing the delay of Nether Blast by first casting it and then Decrepify during the 0.9 second delay is a good way to combo the abilities.<br/><br/>Building Refresher Orb on Pugna will let you place 2 Nether Wards at once. While the mana degeneration doesn't stack, a spell cast by the enemy will cause 2 bursts of damage provided both Wards are in range.<br/><br/>Nether Ward has a pretty large area of effect, which can potentially trouble spellcasters, as it can deplete their mana supply as well as be zapped by Mana Flare which deals damage based on the mana cost of the spell. Heroes with abilities that have very high mana cost shouldn't use it as they can be killed by just a simple cast.<br/><br/>Make sure you are well within range when using Life Drain on an enemy. Using it at maximum range will allow your target to easily leave the area and cancel the spell.<br/><br/>Life Drain deals magical damage, which means it can be amplified by Decrepify, thus increasing the health healed too.<br/><br/>Life Drain is much more effective during the day, because the channeling is canceled if the target moves into fog of war. As such, having any units go chase the target can maximize the range.<br/><br/>Tranquil Boots also give Pugna armor and great regeneration through all parts of the game, including the late game, where it is possible to keep the regeneration and bonus movement speed since you will almost constantly be casting spells instead of auto-attacking."

      "bio": "The Ecclesiast-King of Elze nursed a desire for pain--forbidden pain. In a less prominent political figure, such desires might be considered unwise, but in a monarch of his stature, to satisfy such thirsts would have threatened the virtue of the Divine Throne itself. Therefore he turned to his dungeon full of demonologists, promising freedom to whoever could summon a personal succubus of torment and bind it entirely to his service. The creature who arrived, Akasha by name, visited upon him such exquisite torments that he named her his Secret Queen, and he began to spend all his spare moments submitting to her clever torments--eventually abdicating all his responsibilities in his pursuit of the painful pleasures that only she could bring. Queen of Pain could bring him to the brink of death, but she was rune-bound to keep him alive. At last the King's neglect of state brought on an uprising. He was dragged from his chamber and hurled from the Tower of Invocations, and at the moment of death, Queen of Pain was let loose into the world, freed from servitude--freed to visit her sufferings on anyone she deigned to notice.",
      "tips": "Queen of Pain's combinations must be executed with extreme speed to be successful, as her two main damaging abilities are area-of-effect and consequently can be avoided with a quick reaction. A typical combo is to Blink, Scream of Pain, Shadow Strike, and if necessary, Sonic Wave to finish the job. If the enemy flees however, you can kill them simply by blinking ahead of them and continuing to use Scream of Pain.<br/><br/>Note however that because her two main damaging spells are area-of-effect, they should be positioned to affect as many enemies as possible. For this reason, it is best to save Sonic Wave until such time as you can hit multiple enemy heroes with it. <br/><br/>Taking Blink first can allow you to cliff jungle in games where someone has already picked a mid and a solo offlaner, by blinking to areas where you can attack creeps but they cannot retaliate, such as Radiant's lower left hard camp. It's recommended to rush a Hand of Midas if you do this, to recoup the early experience loss from not being in a lane.<br/><br/>Faceless Void's Chronosphere, Enigma's Black Hole and Magnus's Reverse Polarity work extremely well for setting up a Sonic Wave for maximum targets.<br/><br/>QoP is superb at chasing her prey, but is very delicate and is often in more danger from enemy towers than enemy heroes. Gearing for HP regeneration may be advisable, as in a critical situation you can Blink to an inaccessible place and wait to recuperate. Bottle will also help with this.<br/><br/>If being chased (a common situation for QoP), an often-useful tactic is to blink behind the enemies pursuing you. They will typically assume you blinked ahead and continue on in that direction, allowing for an escape.<br/><br/>In a late-game encounter, QoP is best used by hiding until such time as the enemies' more powerful spells are on cooldown, allowing her to Blink in and inflict huge damage on multiple enemies owing to her AoE capabilities without putting her at risk of being killed by powerful spells.<br/><br/>A more cautious strategy is to run in without using Blink, saving it for a potential escape. This may be necessary against high-damage enemy heroes, as QoP is very frail and in encounters should try to avoid being attacked at all.<br/><br/>Similarly to Lina, QoP has very high burst damage capabilities, but is delicate and not suited to long encounters because of her spells' high mana costs. This can be remedied with items such as Bloodstone and Linken's Sphere, as well as scepter to reduce Sonic Wave's cooldown.<br/><br/>Be aware that Rupture will be calculated against the distance traversed should you Blink when they are applied to you.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger allows you to blink in using the Dagger, unleash your abilities, and blink out using your normal Blink ability."

Drifting above the Maze, Razor looks down on the baffled souls below, and delivers jolts of scalding electricity that both punish and quicken the souls as they decide their own fates, hurrying on toward luminous exits or endlessly dark pits. Razor is the eternal embodiment of a dominating power, abstract and almost clinical in his application of power. Yet he has a lordly air that suggests he takes a sardonic satisfaction in his work.",
      "tips": "Mekansm and Drum of Endurance are very strong alternatives to Vanguard due to its poor viability on ranged characters. Mekansm is the stronger choice, but if someone else on the team is going to get it quickly (meaning at roughly the same time Razor could farm it, not 10 minutes later) Drums help Razor keep on his target and also tanks him up.<br/><br/>Consider Phase Boots instead of Power Treads, as they allow you to keep in tether range of Static Link.<br/><br/>Yasha is a strong item to get after the core as it works well with Unstable Current and further increases the movement speed of Razor plus it grants you the opportunity to upgrade it into either the Manta Style or the Sange and Yasha based on different situations.<br/><br/>Plasma Field can be manipulated by moving Razor around, since it centers around him. This can help you position yourself so that Plasma Field can hit right at its maximum range. This ability does significant damage, so in lane it can be used to harass and force your opponents out of lane at the cost of pushing the lane. If your lane is warded, this can often times be worth it.<br/><br/>Razor has very few escape mechanisms, but can be deceptively durable with Unstable Current if focused.<br/><br/>Use Static Link defensively in larger team fights to ensure you can gain the maximum drain amount without putting yourself in a bad position.<br/><br/>Eye of the Storm damages the lowest health enemy close to him, making this ability very weak near creep waves. Try to save the ultimate for isolated team fights, or use Plasma Field to clear the creep wave quickly to focus the damage on heroes.<br/><br/>In team fights, it is Razor's job to Static Link for the enemy carry and steal their farmed up power for himself. Once a link has been established and the fight has begun, Razor may choose whether to use the stolen damage to smite the enemy supports, or kill the carry himself.<br/><br/>Static Link will not be purged if Razor's target becomes magic immune during the drain.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade is an excellent item on Razor because the invisibility will conceal the particles for Static Link and Eye of the Storm, concealing Razor's position.<br/><br/>Refresher Orb allows two instances of Eye of the Storm to be active at the same time, allowing for extreme DPS and armor reduction. <br/><br/>Combined with Aghanim's Scepter, this can deal twice the damage to buildings.<br/><br/>Generally in the early game, its best to pick up Static Link as it can boost your survivability by lowering enemy damage as well as allow you to create a noticeable difference in you and your opponents last hitting power. This allows you to dominate the last hitting stage of the lane and keep your enemies in check. <br/><br/>When laning against a solitary opponent (mid or versus solo off-lane), you can easily zone your opponent out of last hits by using Static Link on them then standing in or behind their creep wave. This forces them to do one of a few things: fight you, walk away to break the link and prevent the damage steal, or let you steal all of their damage. This capability makes Razor a solid choice for mid lane.<br/><br/>Static Link is not broken by spells that hide the target such as Outworld Devourer's Astral Imprisonment or Shadow Demon's Disruption, or if the target is Cycloned such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity or Invoker's Tornado).<br/><br/>Static Link will also stay applied to the hero Brewmaster when using Primal Split, and will continue to sap damage from the Earth Spirit."

This can be done by only standing in XP range or if you already have Permanent Invisibility you can gain XP even more safely.<br/><br/>Only upgrade the Diffusal Blade when it's out of charges, as you buy the Diffusal Blade for the slow primarily. This will allow for more kill potential as well as more escape (in that you can purge debuffs)."

      "bio": "Any mage can cast a spell or two, and a few may even study long enough to become a wizard, but only the most talented are allowed to be recognized as a Magus. Yet as with any sorcerer's circle, a sense of community has never guaranteed competitive courtesy.<br/><br/>Already a renowned duelist and scholar of the grander world of sorcery, it had never occurred to Rubick that he might perhaps be Magus material until he was in the midst of his seventh assassination attempt. As he casually tossed the twelfth of a string of would-be killers from a high balcony, it dawned on him how utterly unimaginative the attempts on his life had become. Where once the interruption of a fingersnap or firehand might have put a cheerful spring in his step, it had all become so very predictable. He craved greater competition. Therefore, donning his combat mask, he did what any wizard seeking to ascend the ranks would do: he announced his intention to kill a Magus.<br/><br/>Rubick quickly discovered that to threaten one Magus is to threaten them all, and they fell upon him in force. Each antagonist's spell was an unstoppable torrent of energy, and every attack a calculated killing blow. But very soon something occurred that Rubick's foes found unexpected: their arts appeared to turn against them. Inside the magic maelstrom, Rubick chuckled, subtly reading and replicating the powers of one in order to cast it against another, sowing chaos among those who had allied against him. Accusations of betrayal began to fly, and soon the sorcerers turned one upon another without suspecting who was behind their undoing.<br/><br/>When the battle finally drew to a close, all were singed and frozen, soaked and cut and pierced. More than one lay dead by an ally's craft. Rubick stood apart, sore but delighted in the week's festivities. None had the strength to argue when he presented his petition of assumption to the Hidden Council, and the Insubstantial Eleven agreed as one to grant him the title of Grand Magus.",
      "tips": "Both his Telekinesis and his Fade Bolt have a high mana cost. Try to be conservative of your mana early on until you can grab some items such as a Void Stone or a Bottle to accommodate his somewhat high mana costs for the early stages of the game.<br/><br/>Fade Bolt harassment makes you a powerful midlane hero, since the attack damage reduction secondary effect also makes it more difficult for your opponent to lasthit properly.<br/><br/>Against heavy magic damage teams, you may have to invest an early point on Null Field since its percentage reduction will scale into later stages of the game.<br/><br/>Although a great disabler and potential initiator with the right items, Rubick is still frail with the proper focus on him. Stay back as much as you can to avoid unnecessary damage and keep casting and stealing spells!<br/><br/>Be specially careful against Void. Stealing Void's ultimate may turn the tide against your team, since he will not be locked by Rubick's Chronosphere. If you steal it, try to use it when Faceless Void is either dead or far away.<br/><br/>Almost all of his spells, including the spells he steals, have 0.1 casting time. So spells such as Earthshaker's Fissure and Leshrac's Split Earth will cast immediately. Use this knowledge to your advantage. (Although any spell that require him to channel such as Enigma's Black Hole or Sand King's Epicenter will still require Rubick to channel).<br/><br/>If you are in a side lane, try laning with partners that have powerful nukes, attacks or stuns even in the early game. Heroes such as Juggernaut, Bane, Zeus, Wraith King, Chaos Knight, Luna and Ogre Magi are perfect, as target-point abilities can be used on enemy heroes Rubick is holding in mid-air.<br/><br/>Rubick is also a good partner for Heroes with a difficult to land stun/nuke. Kunkka, Alchemist, Lina, Jakiro, Leshrac, Ancient Apparition or even Invoker with his Sun Strike will greatly benefit from your Telekinesis. Also note that you can steal those abilities to disable enemies yourself for a long duration.<br/><br/>Morph Strength Gain is a good spell to steal as it allows you to morph all Agility into Strength permanently, even if you lose the ability. However, it is important to never go full Agility.<br/><br/>Stolen Psionic Traps do not get destroyed when you lose the spell, and can be very useful to set up permanent vision of rune spots, Roshan, ancient camps and other key spots on the map. If you lose this spell and steal it again, you may still set 5/8/11 traps (depending on the level of the stolen spell) without destroying the other traps. This can give your team a great vision advantage since the number of traps you can set is virtually limitless.<br/><br/>Anti Mage's Blink is a great spell to steal since it gives Rubick the mobility he needs, and has lower cooldown compared to Blink Dagger. Having both will give Rubick a tremendous escape/initiation mechanism!<br/><br/>A stolen Meat Hook can be extremely useful to initiate teamfights. Most enemy heroes won't expect to be hooked, which causes them to be less careful about their positioning. The same goes for Mirana's Sacred Arrow.<br/><br/>Spell Steal cannot steal passive abilities, but stealing Slark's Shadow Dance will give Rubick the passive part of the ability too.<br/><br/>Be careful when stealing spells from Keeper of the Light. If you steal a spell used with Spirit Form right after its duration ends, the spell will be inactive!<br/><br/>You can convert creeps using Chen's Holy Persuasion, but all converted creeps die once you lose the spell. The same goes for Lone Druid's Spirit Bear.<br/><br/>Storm Spirit's Ball Lightning, when stolen by Rubick, has its manacost adjusted for Rubick's mana pool.<br/><br/>A stolen Broodmother's Spin Web will give Rubick the invisibility and everything else. It does not interact with Broodmother at all."

But when it needs must find a form to communicate with those of more limited scope, it frees a fragment of itself, and fills a carapace of magic armor formed by the cunning Djinn of Qaldin. This essential identity calls itself Crixalis, meaning 'Soul of the Sand,' but others know it as Sand King. Sand King takes the form of a huge arachnid, inspired by the Scintillant Waste's small but ubiquitous denizens; and this is a true outward expression of his ferocious nature. Guardian, warrior, ambassador--Sand King is all of these things, inseparable from the endless desert that gave him life.",
      "tips": "If laning against one or more melee heroes, Caustic Finale can destroy their ability to farm by making sure each time an enemy creep dies, it causes area of effect damage.<br/><br/>Blink Dagger is a commonly built item for Sand King, used to initiate after channeling your Ultimate. The combo of Ulti+shift click blink is a strong way to enter team fights with the element of surprise and deal a ton of area of effect damage.<br/><br/>Epicenter's potential damage is high. A full blast of level 3 epicenter will result in 1100 magical damage (before magic resistance) dealt to all heroes within its radius.<br/><br/>After initiating, Sand Storm will protect you from auto attacks as well as deal damage to any enemy who stays in the area.<br/><br/>In early game, hitting each creep once with Caustic Finale, followed by Burrowstrike will deal large damage in that area and can potentially kill any enemy hero who happens to be there.<br/><br/>An effective early game combo involves using Burrowstrike on an enemy so they end up facing away from you and then immediately casting Epicenter. If done correctly, the enemy will be unable to stun you out of the channel phase and it will almost guarantee a kill. You should discontinue this around mid game, as you will need to save your ultimate for teamfight situations.<br/><br/>The philosophy behind Sand Storm is that the enemy will grow bored of waiting for you to end its channeling, or will be too busy with the rest of your team to care about you. Note that while you cannot be hurt by autoattacks during its channeling, area of effect spells affect you fully. In the cases where the enemy has an AOE stun such as Lina's Light Strike Array or Invoker's Deafening Blast, it might be better to use Burrowstrike as an escape tool.<br/><br/>Linken's Sphere is also a great item on Sand King since it gives him survivability and makes the channeling of Epicenter more difficult to stop. Pipe of Insight is another good survivability item for Sand King.<br/><br/>A second disable such as Orchid Malevolence or Scythe of Vyse are also great items. <br/><br/>Urn of Shadows is also a very viable item for a middle lane Sand King or one who wishes to keep ganking.<br/><br/>Sand King can be played as an early game jungler by stacking the neutral camps and killing them off with Sand Storm. However, it may be better to jungle from level 3 onwards, as Sand Storm is much more powerful at level 2. A capable jungle Sand King will be able to farm a Blink Dagger and Boots of Speed by 8 or 9 minutes.<br/><br/>Veil of Discord provides just as much added magical damage as an Aghanim's Scepter but the debuff amplifies the magical damage output of all your allies as well, making it a somewhat superior choice over Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/>A maxed out Caustic Finale will allow Sand King to split push very effectively and is especially helpful in countering large creep waves during the late game."

   "shadow_demon": {
      "bio": "Among the sovereign Demons with explicit access to this world, Doom scarcely bothers with the affairs of Noninfernals and Lesser Spectral Consorts, while Shadow Fiend passes through almost exclusively on collecting expeditions. The Shadow Demon, however, has always taken a deep and abiding interest in the material plane, as if sensing that mastery of this gritty dimensional nexus might be the key to total domination of all realities. Summoned first by minor wizards, the Shadow Demon granted every wish and put on increasingly impressive displays of power until he had the full attention of the greatest demonologists, and through them the various lords, tyrants, autarchs and heirophants who depended on sorcery to buttress their mundane power. So great was his deception that all his summoners considered themselves the master and Shadow Demon the servant; meanwhile, he eroded their identities and made their minds his own. In the end, most members of the cult were hollow puppets, extensions of his evil will. What Shadow Demon's next step would have been remains open to speculation, for around this time, Nevermore the Shadow Fiend bit into a particularly nasty-tasting soul and discovered that it held nothing but a foul nougat of Shadow Demon's essence. Alerted that a coup was underway, and that the ancient equilibrium of the Umbral Pact was about to be destabilized, Doom Bringer and Shadow Fiend briefly joined forces to destroy the burgeoning cult. Combining spells of incredible force, they undid Shadow Demon's centuries of patient work, reducing his cult to smithereens--and all its members to a bloody splatter. Nothing remained except a tiny speck of demon shadow. Immortal and irreducible, this mote of evil was enough to seed the Shadow Demon's next scheme, and in fits and starts, over further centuries, he began to regroup. Whatever that speck of shadow touched, it tainted, and its influence gradually grew. A chaos of damaged parts pulled together, reknit, and combined to give Shadow Demon a form even stronger than his former. He is all but complete now, and his plan for infinite dominion lacks all of its former weaknesses. It would seem that such a being of pure malice and malevolence, a threat to all creation, would be forever out of place in our world...yet Shadow Demon does not lack for followers. ",
      "tips": "If you are facing a hero with a strong orb effect like Anti-Mage in the lane, use Disruption on them often and force them to flee from the illusions.<br/><br/>Shadow Poison becomes much more lethal when stacked up to 5 or more, with this, you can destroy enemy heroes in the lane, even in the earliest stages. However, the mana cost is great and you should learn to control your mana or buy mana-boosting items for you to perform.<br/><br/>Soul Catcher synergizes extremely well with single-target nukes, such as Finger of Death, Laguna Blade, or Dagon.<br/><br/>Soul Catcher is extremely effective in conjunction with Pure damage spells since they ignore any kind of magic armor and are amplified.<br/><br/>Disruption can save you or teammates from incoming damage and spells.<br/><br/>Disruption can be used to help teammates land spells such as Torrent, Sacred Arrow, Light Strike Array and even Sun Strike or Slithereen Crush. When combined with Soul Catcher, this makes for a powerful ganking combination."

Over the ages he has claimed the souls of poets, priests, emperors, beggars, slaves, philosophers, criminals and (naturally) heroes; no sort of soul escapes him. What he does with them is unknown. No one has ever peered into the Abysm whence Nevermore reaches out like an eel from among astral rocks. Does he devour them one after another? Does he mount them along the halls of an eldritch temple, or pickle the souls in necromantic brine? Is he merely a puppet, pushed through the dimensional rift by a demonic puppeteer? Such is his evil, so intense his aura of darkness, that no rational mind may penetrate it. Of course, if you really want to know where the stolen souls go, there's one sure way to find out: Add your soul to his collection. Or just wait for Nevermore.",
      "tips": "While laning, try to use Shadowraze to harass your opponent as well as kill creeps.<br/><br/>Use Shadowraze early if you're having trouble building souls; 75 damage from level 1 Shadowraze is higher than the 35-41 base attack damage you start with.<br/><br/>Shadowraze and Necromastery should be maxed before levelling Requiem, as the first one is your main nuke and Requiem doesn't do much damage without full souls.<br/><br/>Remember that Necromastery receives souls from all kills, including denies.<br/><br/>Skipping Slippers of Agility to instead get Clarity potions allows you to last hit using Shadowraze until you have a decent amount of right-click damage.<br/><br/>Wraith Band can be replaced with a Bracer for more health if needed, you can also upgrade it to a Drum of Endurance for added movement speed and attack speed and +9 to all of your attributes. <br/><br/>Blink Dagger is usually built to help position your Requiem and Razes, and it also functions well as an escape/chasing mechanism. Shadow Blade is easier to build and a simpler alternative, but lacks the instant initiation like a blink dagger will do; it is also countered with invisibility detection.<br/><br/>In team fights, after you get Blink Dagger, let someone else initiate, blink in and cast Requiem when the opposing team is already concentrated in a small area.<br/><br/>Easy jungle creeps take but a few Shadowrazes to kill and offer an easy way to boost Necromastery in a tough mid lane or after a death. If you become physically weak and cannot risk taking any more damage in the laning phase, you may consider pushing the lane out far enough to let you quickly visit the jungle."

For three, he'd castrate your pig, for five, he'd circumcise your sons. For a good meal, he'd don his shaman garb, read from his ancient books, and lay a curse upon your enemies. His strange new youngling, part hill troll, part...something else, worked as assistant and lent an air of the exotic to the con-man's trade. <br/><br/>Always one step ahead of cheated customers, one town ahead of a pursuing patronage, the two trekked across the blighted lands until one day the con-man realized that the little youngling could actually do what he only pretended at. His ward had a gift - a gift that customers valued. And so the youngling Rhasta was thrust before the crowds, and the trade-name Shadow Shaman was born. The two continued from town to town, conjuring for money as Shadow Shaman's reputation grew. Eventually, the pair's duplicitous past caught up with them, and they were ambushed by a mob of swindled ex-clients. The con-man was slain, and for the first time, Rhasta used his powers for darkness, massacring the attackers. He buried his beloved master, and now uses his powers to destroy any who would seek to do him harm.",
      "tips": "Euls Scepter of Divinity is a commonly built item, used in conjunction with Mass Serpent Wards. Catching an enemy hero in a cyclone gives you ample time to place the Serpent Wards around the hero, trapping it. You can then further disable the hero by using Shackles.<br/><br/>Shackles is a channeling spell. Enemy units and heroes can interrupt Rhasta with stuns and disables, when he is holding enemy down. It's better to use it when your target is alone.<br/><br/>Always cancel the backswing animation after casting your spells, as Rhasta's animations are quite lengthy.<br/><br/>Necronomicon is an ideal choice to attack your enemy while you're shackling it. Together with your Serpent Wards and the Necronomicon's Summons, the kill is almost guaranteed.<br/><br/>Rhasta's spells have a very high mana cost. Build up your mana pool and mana regeneration with items or you may find yourself unable to cast anything in critical situations.<br/><br/>A useful trick when going one-on-one with an opponent is to summon your Mass Serpent Ward near or behind the enemy and then hold them in place with your Shackles spell. If mana will allow, using Hex will give you a few seconds to set this up uninterrupted.<br/><br/>Rhasta's Serpent Wards can be commanded. Beginners often neglect to control them, but even if Rhasta is dead he can have a big impact on a fight with intelligent use of his wards.<br/><br/>Medallion of Courage is a very useful item, as his Serpent Wards deal physical damage."

He was the prophesied one, the culmination of two-hundred years of careful pairings, a war-mage who would bring glory to the order, and destruction to their sworn enemies, The Knights of the Fold. <br/><br/>Raised with other young mages in a hidden cantonment among the hills of the Hazhadal barrens, the order's preceptors waited for Nortrom's abilities to manifest. While the other students honed their talents with fire, or ice, or incantatory spells, Nortrom sat silent and talentless, unable to cast so much as a hex. As the day of final testing approached, he still hadn't found his magic. In disgust, the preceptors berated him, while the children laughed. \"You are no mage,\" the head of the order declared. Still, Nortrom did not slink away. He entered the day of testing and faced down the young mages who had mocked him. And then his preceptors learned a valuable lesson: a lack of magic can be the greatest magic of all. Nortrom silenced the young mages one by one and defeated them in single combat, until he alone stood as champion of the Aeol Drias, in fulfillment of the prophecy.",
      "tips": "The large radius on Curse of the Silent makes him a very strong harasser.<br/><br/>Curse of the Silent is great against heroes like Tiny or Pudge that require a lot of mana to cast their spells very early on.<br/><br/>Take at least one level of Glaives of Wisdom early game. This can be used to harass by Orb Walking.<br/><br/>Silencer can be considered a counter-initiate hero, because of his high disruption with Global Silence. Use this knowledge to completely cripple enemies that could do anything dangerous to your team.<br/><br/>Against heroes that have low mana cost abilities, it's best to let them expend mana before you cast Curse of the Silent, as it is your main source of damage early game.<br/><br/>Silencer is able to become a carry via high intelligence coupled with Glaives of Wisdom, whether he gains that intelligence by kills or by items.<br/><br/>Last Word curses his target to be faced with unfortunate consequences, if they cast a spell during the debuff duration, they will be silenced and damaged, this is perfect for breaking the spell combo of his enemies like Tiny and Tinker. If they don't cast a spell until the duration. they will still be silenced and damaged, but they will also be disarmed, this works well with Curse of the Silent and Global Silence, and it's crucial for enemy carries who rely on their physical attacks, as they can't attack or even cast spells for a long time.<br/><br/>Last Word also effectively gives the enemy a choice - cast a spell, likely wasting mana due to bad timing or a lack of player-targets for the spell, or don't cast a spell - and be disarmed in addition to the silence.<br/><br/>A Dagon can be purchased by Silencer, adding powerful burst damage to his arsenal and increasing his intelligence. This along with Silencer's other nukes can easily kill most enemies early game.<br/><br/>If Silencer is fighting against Outworld Devourer, it is possible that Outworld Devourer's Sanity's Eclipse will be ineffective against Silencer as long as Silencer's Intelligence can surpass Outworld Devourer's due to his innate Intelligence steal.<br/><br/>Silencer on his own is not an initiator; if you try to initiate with Global Silence alone, the enemy team will simply walk away and wait out the silence. However, Global Silence can synergize extremely well with almost any initiator. When someone on your team initiates (or immediately before), activate Global Silence. The other team will be helpless as you collapse on them.<br/><br/>Silencer's Global Silence and Last Word are great for tying down heroes that rely on abilities to evade (Weaver, Storm Spirit, Queen of Pain, etc.).<br/><br/>Unmentioned, and situational, a Refresher Orb can be purchased if the enemy is mostly reliant on their usage of spells in a fight. If a fight occurs, you can silence the enemy at max level up to 12 seconds by using the Refresher Orb to cast your ultimate again (14 with Aghanim's Scepter). Heroes who need their spells to be effective are left useless in team fights.<br/><br/>If last word is used while/before phoenix uses his escape skill he will not be able to cancel it."

      "bio": "A highly placed mage in the court of the Ghastly Eyrie, Dragonus lives a troubled existence. Sworn by birth to protect whoever sits within the Nest of Thorns, he hates the current Skywrath queen with all his soul. As a youth, high-born, he was a friend and companion to the eldest Skywrath princess, Shendelzare, first in line for the Nest. He had loved her warmly and unshakably, but as his studies took hold, his mind turned to arcane learning and the mastery of Skywrath sorcery.<br/><br/>Obsessed with matters aetherial, he missed the mundane signs of courtly treachery that hinted at a plot against Shendelzare, and lost his chance to foil it. When the court was shaken by a swift and violent coup, he emerged from his studies to discover his oldest and dearest friend had been lost to him. The Nest of Thorns now belonged to Shendelzare's ruthless younger sister, and Dragonus could do nothing. The magic of the Skywrath Mage serves only the sworn protector of the Skywrath scion, so to act against the Nest would render him helpless. He clings to his post, believing it to be the best hope of one day restoring his true love to her rightful place. Meanwhile, his secret is known only to the goddess Scree'auk, whose magic it was transformed Shendelzare from a crippled physical creature into an embodiment of pure vengeful energy.<br/><br/>While he dreams of restoring his beloved queen to the Ghastly Eyrie, he dreams even more desperately of restoring Shendelzare herself to a fully healed physical form. The duplicity of his role at court tortures him, for he is a noble and good-hearted creature; but the worst torture of all is imagining the hatred that Vengeful Spirit must hold in her heart for him.",
      "tips": "Skywrath Mage needs to control the spacing between him and his opponents carefully. Skirt the outside of the fight and slow and silence enemies that attempt to shut you down, everything you can do has very long range and your turnspeed is very fast.<br/><br/>The amplification of magic damage couples nicely with arcane bolt's bonus intelligence damage. Ancient Seal also silences your target, so use this to net kills early game. <br/><br/>Arcane Bolt deals a lot of damage at level 1 to level 1 heroes. When coupled with Intelligence bonus items like Mantle of Intelligence, even more damage is dealt. The mana cost is also very low, so it's a wonderful harrassment tool. It will also make last-hitting an easy task when you have some good mana regen going.<br/><br/>Skywrath Mage is a very squishy hero, so HP items are commonly built. When laning or in a teamfight, try to stay out of range of enemy auto-attacks, and use your abilities from a distance, only jumping in when necessary. Force Staff solves this problem easily, allowing a quick escape if danger arises.<br/><br/>Mystic Flare is much more efficient on single heroes during ganks, since they receive the full, undistributed damage amount. Try to use this with an ally's stun, however, as the AoE is very small, and very easy to escape out of when not disabled. Using Mystic Flare during a teamfight isn't a bad idea, but it only really works if all the enemies are stunned by a large AoE teamfight Ultimate, such as Magnus's Reverse Polarity. Mystic Flare can be used to kill off the remaining heroes after the stun has been successful.<br/><br/>You will need to be extremely careful when facing heroes that can deal damage based on your mana pool or intelligence. Examples of this include Pugna's Nether Ward, Anti-Mage's Mana Void and Nyx's Mana Burn. If these heroes are giving you trouble, you may even wish to consider a Black King Bar of your own later in the game to keep you protected from these powerful counters during teamfights.<br/><br/>It is common to begin ganking at level 6. Skywrath Mage needs all the farm he can get for his core items and all the experience for more levels, which equal more intelligence.<br/><br/>Skywrath Mage's killing combo is to initate Concussive shot, then ,before the Concussive shot hits, use Ancient Seal . Follow up with Mystic Flare and some Arcane Bolt's to finish them off. Most supports and squishy heroes like Sniper will drop right after Mystic Flare and one or two Arcane Bolts.<br/><br/>A wonderful combination are Legion Commander's Duel and Mystic Flare, this will allow Tresdin to snowball much faster and with far greater ease.<br/><br/>It is best to lane with heroes with stuns like Vengeful Spirit, Lion or even Alchemist. Stuns guarantee that Skywrath Mage will be able to land his Mystic Flare. Similarily, Heroes with long lasting disables like Shadow Shaman can hold them in place long enough for Skywrath to hit them with some Arcane Bolts and Mystic Flare.<br/><br/>Although Aghanim's Scepter is usually very weak due to Mystic Flare's high mana cost, having an Outworld Devourer on your team, while having a fair bit of farm yourself can justify the item pickup. But beware, at level 3, Essence Aura will NOT restore mana for each use of Mystic Flare, because of its lack of cooldown.<br/><br/>Only build Dagon if you lack enough burst damage to kill a certain hero on the enemy team. Because of your massive damage output, it almost renders Dagon useless.<br/><br/>Concussive Shot will not target illusions, so it can be used to distinguish a real hero from illusions.<br/><br/>If you are level 6 and you plan to kill with a level 1 Mystic Flare, you need to make sure that you harass the opponent roughly half-way, due to the fact that when you factor in magic resistance, it will only deal 450 maximum damage, even lower if they do not stay in for the entire 2 seconds. Having 1 point in Ancient Seal will increase the damage to 585 magical damage maximum, fixing up the problem and deal a bit more damage, which counts in the early game."

This can give carries like Anti-Mage, Drow Ranger, and Huskar a hard time in defeating him.<br/><br/>Sprint supports a highly aggressive early game playstyle. Should the lane be pushed close to your tower, an easy kill can be acquired even with high health heroes if you are laning with someone with a reliable slow or stun.<br/><br/>Use Sprint carefully in the early game however - it increases the damage you take in addition to raising your movement speed, which can sometimes make the kill easier with an opponent who can chase you efficiently (such as Anti-Mage with his Blink ability).<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian is a very cost effective way of increasing Slardar's DPS. In longer engagements some form of HP sustaining items to counteract the drain may be useful.

   "sniper": {
      "bio": "Kardel Sharpeye was born deep in the mountains of Knollen where, since time immemorial, Keen Folk have survived by hunting the strange, cliff-dwelling steepstalkers above their village, shooting them from a distance and collecting the carcasses where they fell. Sharpeye was among the best of these strange mountain keens for whom projectile weapons are but another appendage, and to shoot is as natural as to touch. <br/><br/>On his day of summoning, when he was to gain full standing in his village, Sharpeye took the ancient test: a single shot from the valley floor to strike a beast down from the cliffs. To miss was to be dishonored. With his entire village standing vigil, Sharpeye took his shot. A steepstalker fell; the crowd cheered. But when the carcass was collected, the village grew silent, for the elders found that the bullet had pierced its glittering central eye then fallen to be clenched in the steepstalker's mandibles. This ominous sign was the literal opening of a dark prophecy, foretelling both greatness and exile for the gunman who made such a shot. Sharpeye the Sniper was thus, by his own skill, condemned to make his way apart from his people-and unwelcome back among them until he has fulfilled the remainder of the prophecy by attaining legendary stature on a field of battle.",
      "tips": "Sniper's main advantage is his range - always remain as far away from harm as possible while still dealing damage.<br/><br/>Shrapnel is an incredibly versatile and useful ability with excellent range and a low mana cost. Among its myriad uses are chasing, farming, anti-juking, creep clearing and impeding chasing enemies or those attempting to close to melee range.<br/><br/>Carefully consider your laning situation when deciding which of Sniper's abilities to max first. It is common to level up Shrapnel first when playing him in the middle for the lane control it provides, which is particularly effective in the relatively cramped environment of the river. On the other hand, maxing Headshot first in the safe lane can be very potent, especially against a melee solo offlaner like Tidehunter or Elder Titan.<br/><br/>One level of Take Aim is typically enough for the laning phase since it allows Sniper to outrange every enemy except Lina and Techies. Only invest extra points early if you're taking very heavy ranged harassment.<br/><br/>Use Assassinate to finish fleeing enemies if and when they manage to get out of range of your regular attacks, or if you're not involved directly in a fight and wish to finish an enemy off without revealing your precise location.<br/><br/>Since Assassinate grants full vision of an enemy during the cast time it can be used to counter an enemy attempting to juke your allies in the trees or go invisible. The extra couple of seconds of vision can often make the difference.<br/><br/>Although not mentioned in his recommended items - and for good reason - a Mask of Madness is a fairly common purchase on Sniper as a large and cost effective increase to his DPS and farming potential at the expense of increasing his already significant fragility. Extreme care should be taken with this item choice though, as enemies who can close the gap on you easily like Earth Spirit, or deal large amounts of damage from range like Lion will annihilate you in short order. This goes double for enemy carries with natural mobility such as Faceless Void, Phantom Assassin or Anti-Mage.<br/><br/>If possible, try to have at least one teammate on a hero who can get into the enemy team's face and keep their attention while you sit at range and deal damage during teamfights. Centaur Warrunner and Bristleback would be good examples. Sniper is a great deal more difficult to play in lineups which lack this component to some degree.<br/><br/>Divine Rapier is a very situational item for Sniper. While it greatly increases Sniper's damage per second and can kill frail Heroes or those with no escape mechanism, Sniper himself is frail and is subject to nuke/disable combos. Always try to keep distance and have an escape mechanism ready, such as Shadow Blade or Blink Dagger if you plan on buying this item."

   "spectre": {
      "bio": "Just as higher states of energy seek a lower level, the Spectre known as Mercurial is a being of intense and violent energy who finds herself irresistibly drawn to scenes of strife as they unfold in the physical world. While her normal spectral state transcends sensory limitations, each time she takes on a physical manifestation, she is stricken by a loss of self--though not of purpose. In the clash of combat, her identity shatters and reconfigures, and she begins to regain awareness. She grasps that she is Mercurial the Spectre--and that all of her Haunts are but shadows of the one true Spectre. Focus comes in the struggle for survival; her true mind reasserts itself; until in the final moments of victory or defeat, she transcends matter and is restored once more to her eternal form.",
      "tips": "Spectre has a weak early- and mid-game, as well as a lack of lane presence. Picking Spectre requires a team that will largely be able to hold out for a large portion of the game until you have accumulated enough major items to start fighting, so keep this in mind when building your team.<br/><br/>One of Spectre's biggest strengths as a carry is her ability to participate in teamfights and ganks instantly through Haunt without wasting valuable farming time.<br/><br/>The shadow path left by Spectral Dagger lets her keep track on her prey. It also slows her target and enemies who came in to the path.<br/><br/>It is generally a good idea to level up Spectral Dagger first to provide Spectre with extra mobility so that she is harder to pin down during ganks. However, be wary of its mana cost, as a single Spectral Dagger will typically consume half your mana pool per cast (in the early game).<br/><br/>Maxing Desolate early is the best way to increase the effectiveness of Haunt. Maxing Spectral Dagger early, on the other hand, is also desirable as its level 1 offensive capabilities are almost negligible.<br/><br/>It is sometimes beneficial to leave Haunt at level 1 in the early- and mid-game. Your illusions will not be strong enough to significantly benefit from an extra one or two seconds during skirmishes or team fights, and the extra points may be better spent in your other abilities or the Attribute Bonus.<br/><br/>In late game teamfights, Haunt and Desolate will allow your illusions to wither down support heroes at the back at significant speeds. In addition, you should always be in the middle of team fights to maximize the damage reflection of Dispersion.<br/><br/>Don't forget that Desolate only works if enemies aren't close together. If you're playing against a Spectre, make sure to hug your ally if she comes at you to reduce her damage dramatically.<br/><br/>Spectre can perform as a viable solo offlaner by using Spectral Dagger to hide in trees before creeps meet in lane, allowing you to freely leech EXP off the lane with no risk of being killed, and quickly reach level six to gank with Dagger and Haunt.<br/><br/>Mjollnir adds significant farming and push potential, while filling the AoE damage role of Radiance while also scaling better and having an easier buildup. However, illusions get no benefits from it.<br/><br/>Eye of Skadi provides great general attribute bonuses, solves Spectre's mana issues, and gives her a slow that penetrates through magic immunity that allows her chase and forces attention on her. The early orb of venom and point booster give Spectre great early presence, also late game.<br/><br/>Skull Basher adds some damage and HP along with BKB-penetrating anticarry and chase potential that again forces attention onto her.<br/><br/>Pipe of Insight makes Spectre incredibly tanky against magic damage when combined with dispersion (combined 57% resistance), and increases her teamfight presence with the HP regen and active ability.<br/><br/>Armlet of Mordiggian has incredible synergy with Spectre's skill set. The HP and offensive bonuses work with dispersion and desolate respectively, which also transfer to her haunt illusions. The passive regen fills the need of a vanguard for her core, while armlet toggling provides increased HP for Spectre to disperse.<br/><br/>Assault Cuirass adds extra durability and makes haunt a global -5 armor for the duration while giving any teammates in range extra armor and attack speed. The attack speed has good synergy with desolate, but does not transfer to illusions."

   "spirit_breaker": {
      "bio": "Barathrum the Spirit Breaker is a lordly and powerful being, a fierce and elemental intelligence which chose to plane-shift into the world of matter to take part in events with repercussions in the elemental realm that is his home. To that end, he assembled a form that would serve him well, both in our world and out of it. His physical form borrows from the strengths of this world, blending features both bovine and simian--horns, hooves and hands-as outward emblems of his inner qualities of strength, speed and cunning. He wears a ring in his nose, as a reminder that he serves a hidden master, and that this world in which he works is but a shadow of the real one.",
      "tips": "Black King Bar can be used without interrupting your charge, activate it just when you get close to the enemy to take advantage of its duration during the fight.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade can also be activated while charging, greatly increasing the surprise factor of his charge and preventing easy charge interruption such as Rubick's Telekinesis. In addition, the Shadow Blade bonus damage will be applied to the first attack from invisibility.<br/><br/>Use Charge of Darkness to get close, stun your target, and make him vulnerable to your attacks.<br/><br/>Nether Strike deals major damage to the target enemy and teleports behind them, wherever they go. You can use this to catch blinking or teleporting enemies before they get away.<br/><br/>Greater Bash deals more damage depending on Barathrum's movement speed. Getting items that increase movement speed, such as Sange & Yasha and Drum of Endurance, will greatly improve your damage.<br/><br/>Chaining together Charge of Darkness with Nether Strike can deal high amounts of burst damage in a very short amount of time.<br/><br/>Spirit Breaker has very little teamfight presence due to his specialized abilities, but he can still be useful at neutralizing targets and forcing enemies back.<br/><br/>Charge of Darkness allows Spirit Breaker to run through units, trees, structures and terrain. It also does not indicate your enemies when targeted, letting you setup ganks.<br/><br/>When charging enemy heroes in mid game, be 100% sure that they are alone. A lone enemy may wait out in the open while their ally hides in the trees, waiting for you to charge the bait hero, and finally be ganked. Therefore, Observer Wards can greatly reduce uncertainty before charging.<br/><br/>Although Charge of Darkness is typically used to get into fights, it can also be used to get back out in a pinch; by targeting a creep in a different lane Spirit Breaker can move quickly to avoid death, then cancel the charge when he is out of danger.<br/><br/>Sange and Yasha is a fair pick on Spirit Breaker, as the bonus movespeed improves the damage of his Greater Bash as well as his general speed, improving his chasing ability even further in conjunction with its maim.<br/><br/>Despite being classified as an initiator Spirit Breaker is more of a hunter who takes out lone targets or chases down fleeing enemy heroes after a team fight. To actually initiate you will either need an Aghanim's Scepter so that your ultimate has an AOE presence which in turn weakens your carry potential or use Charge of Darkness in a way that would let you bowl through all of the enemy team heroes (such as aiming for the furthest enemy hero while the enemy team is standing close to a line formation).<br/><br/>Due to the massive speed boost Spirit Breaker receives while charging (288 more than maximum movement speed), he can catch up to a team fight fairly quickly, even from across the map. While preparing for a team fight you might want to stand at the back of your team and let your allies begin to draw out disables and initiation spells from the enemy, then use Charge of Darkness on your target, this will disorient the enemy team as you are likely to be hitting a few of them on the way to your target not to mention that they will be left with no disables to stop you. <br/><br/>Sometimes it might be a good idea to use Nether Strike on a magic immune hero to interrupt their actions as the greater bash will hit them regardless. Situations where for example your team gets caught in a Black Hole by a magic immunue Enigma you can turn the tide of the fight if you can stop him right at the beginning.<br/><br/>Because Linken's Sphere triggers on cast, this ability can be used to instantly and globally put an enemy's sphere on cooldown.<br/><br/>While it does not provide True Sight the indicator will follow the invisible unit being charged and the Charge will still hit an enemy that has gone invisible after being charged. This will cause the ability to interrupt channeling spells being performed by invisible heroes such as Sand King's Sandstorm.<br/><br/>With the use of all of your abilities and some lucky bashes, you can keep a single target stunned for 8 seconds. This is a huge stun duration even late game and allows lucky Barathrums to snowball out of control on lone ganks."

   "storm_spirit": {
      "bio": "Storm Spirit is literally a force of nature--the wild power of wind and weather, bottled in human form. And a boisterous, jovial, irrepressible form it is! As jolly as a favorite uncle, he injects every scene with crackling energy. But it was not always thus, and there was tragedy in his creation. Generations ago, in the plains beyond the Wailing Mountains, a good people lay starving in drought and famine. A simple elementalist, Thunderkeg by name, used a forbidden spell to summon the spirit of the storm, asking for rain. Enraged at this mortal's presumption, the Storm Celestial known as Raijin lay waste to the land, scouring it bare with winds and flood. Thunderkeg was no match for the Celestial--at least until he cast a suicidal spell that forged their fates into one: he captured the Celestial in the cage of his own body. Trapped together, Thunderkeg's boundless good humor fused with Raijin's crazed energy, creating the jovial Raijin Thunderkeg, a Celestial who walks the world in physical form. ",
      "tips": "Electric Vortex allows Raijin to pull his target close enough to his Static Remnant, triggering its damage.<br/><br/>Ball Lightning can be cast at minuscule ranges to trigger Overload.<br/><br/>Using Ball Lightning, Storm Spirit can travel behind enemies, forcing them to turn around to attack him. Dance around an enemy with Ball Lightning to confuse them even more.<br/><br/>A very common combo Storm Spirit uses to nuke down lone heroes is to ambush them with: Ball Lightning > Attack > Vortex > Attack > Remnant > Attack > Ball Lightning through them to dodge their retaliation > Attack > Escape if enemy has not died. This will greatly injure most heroes, and kill those foolish enough to be walking around alone with weakened HP.<br/><br/>Another alternative would be to use ball lightning > overload > vortex > remnant > overload > then just normal attack and use ball lightning to chase enemies when out of range. When engaging heroes like Earthshaker/ Vengeful Spirit, a wise move would be to use ball lightning after vortex is over since the enemy would most likely cast a stun first which storm would be able to dodge.<br/><br/>When engaging a group of heroes, Storm Spirit can actually, although at a risk, be the first one to engage them, followed by several allies already behind him to back him up. This strategy can make enemy heroes blow most cooldowns on Storm Spirit while he can simple run away with Ball Lightning, disable a hero with Electric Vortex, leave a Static Remnant behind and pave the way for allied heroes and their counter initiation.<br/><br/>While in Ball Lightning, you can use items like Shiva's Guard to bring a dazzling yet deadly cold storm which follows around while rolling on. Great for initiating and crippling enemies, along with Overload, escaping away is most unlikely. You can also cast Static Remnant for farming or pushing, or just show some amazing power.<br/><br/>If you are going to build a Bloodstone, it is advisable to build Arcane Boots first. This will give you a good mana boost early, and you can dissemble Arcane Boots to finish Bloodstone once you have all necessary components."

With his father executed for violating the Vigil Codex, and his mother shunned by her wild race, Sven believes that honor is to be found in no social order, but only in himself. After tending his mother through a lingering death, he offered himself as a novice to the Vigil Knights, never revealing his identity. For thirteen years he studied in his father's school, mastering the rigid code that declared his existence an abomination. Then, on the day that should have been his In-Swearing, he seized the Outcast Blade, shattered the Sacred Helm, and burned the Codex in the Vigil's Holy Flame. He strode from Vigil Keep, forever solitary, following his private code to the last strict rune. Still a knight, yes...but a Rogue Knight. He answers only to himself.",
      "tips": "Early on, Sven has very low mana, so building mana boosting items may be a good idea.<br/><br/>Sven's good strength gain and base health pool make Soul Ring an effective item in situations where you plan on skirmishing early and often.<br/><br/>Drum of Endurance is a great item as it meshes well with Sven's role and play style, all while providing a strong aura to other members of your team.<br/><br/>Take Attribute Bonus over the two other abilities instead if you want more mana, attack speed and strength to increase the bonus of God's Strength early on and to help sustain your mana for using skills. However, this is only useful very early on, as Warcry is amazing for teamfights and Great Cleave helps Sven's farming speed.<br/><br/>If you prefer to initiate, get a Blink Dagger. Blink to your target and stun them with your Storm Hammer, make sure you activate God's Strength immediately or beforehand, which is more preferable as you can save more time on the casting animation and transformation time.<br/><br/>Avoid leveling Great Cleave early on, as it will greatly push the lane towards the enemy tower making farming more difficult.<br/><br/>As a melee carry without a blink, Sven is especially susceptible to being kited and having crowd control effects placed on him, negating his damage output. Don't skip Black King Bar to buy more damaging items, as it may result in doing no damage at all.<br/><br/>Sven's unique position of being a Support and Carry at the same time can make him a decent babysitter for a ranged carry like Weaver, Luna, or Sniper. <br/><br/>Consider support items such as arcane boots to give you and your lane partner more mana for your spells.<br/><br/>Without taking anything away from your lane partner, always try to find gold whenever and wherever possible (through pulling jungle creeps, roaming to help allies across the map, etc). <br/><br/>Sven's unique kit allows him to transition into a strong late game hero. Although transitioning a dedicated support into a carry is not often ideal and difficult to execute, this can give your team an edge in long games; use this strategy carefully."

Or even Trapper Town. In fact, if one were to track the history of Techies Demolitions they might notice that shortly after Techies appear, towns tend to disappear. Like every inevitable disaster surrounding Techies, the obliteration of Dredger's Bight began with an invention. Tasked with designing a safer way of detonating explosives in the mines beneath the city, pyrotechnic prodigies Squee, Spleen, and Spoon developed their most outlandish creation yet: a button which, when pressed, would trigger a distant device to spark a fuse. Overeager to test their invention, the trio stuffed barrel after barrel with flamesalt explosives, piling every corner of their tiny workshop high with the newly developed remote bombs. From this stockpile they plucked a single payload, burying it in a far away field. As they cowered in a ditch, Spleen pressed the detonator button. Yet after a moment, nothing happened. Confused, he stood up, pressing his button again and again until, finally, an explosion tore a hole in the field. Elated, Squee and Spleen turned toward home just as a massive wave of sound and force arrived to knock them over. Bewildered, their ears ringing from the unexpected blast, they gathered in the dingy miasma to see a smoking ruin where their workshop once stood. Chunks of wood and stone continued to fall as the yawning crater before them slowly deepened into an expanding pit. The whole of Dredger's Bight shuddered, and then gradually started to slide into the mines below as its panicked residents fled. Sitting at the edge of their sinking home they grinned and giggled, as giddy at the possibilities as they were oblivious to the scorn of their former neighbors. They wondered only one thing: how could they trigger an even bigger blast?",
      "tips": "Techies are the most unorthodox hero in the game, as their team contribution comes mainly from placing traps outside of combat rather than engaging enemies in fights. Playing Techies well requires good map awareness and game sense in order to know when and where to place traps.<br/><br/>Techies are also one of the few heroes able to truly mess with the enemy. Play mind games with them. Do not force yourself into any habits, while making sure you continually adapt to theirs.<br/><br/>Due to their skill set, Techies is best played as a roamer or off-laner in the laning stage. The high nuke damage provided by their traps allows them to get early kills with well-placed Land Mines. These traps can make life hard on the enemy's supports if they try to zone you out as an off-laner or rotate for ganks, and can be used to get kills on the enemy mid if they attempt to get runes.<br/><br/>Planting mines very close to each other can increase the amount of focused damage they deal, and confuse the enemy by preventing them from easily seeing how many mines have been placed in a spot. Unlike Techies' other mines, the Land Mines are not phased, so they cannot be stacked perfectly on top of each other. However, their small collision size still allows them to be placed very close to each other.<br/><br/>In general, it is best to place your mines in areas where the fog of war prevents them from being spotted until it is too late. Examples of this include at the top of stairs that transition from low to high ground, inside of trees and juke paths in the jungle, and inside of Roshan's pit.<br/><br/>Keep track of your enemy inventory to see if they have a Gem of True Sight. If you see one, alert your allies and try to retrieve it as soon as possible."

Possessed of a scientific bent, she spent her early years engaged in meticulous study of nature's laws--peering into grimoires of magic and alchemy, recreating experiments from charred fragments of the Violet Archives, and memorizing observations of the Keen recordkeepers. Already quiet and secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects further reinforced her skills of stealth. Had she been less retiring, she might have become notorious among the guilds as a thief-scholar. Instead her investigations led her into far more obscure corners. As she devoted her furtive talents to unlocking the secrets of the universe, she instead unlocked a secret door that exists in nature itself: the entryway to the most Hidden Temple. The intelligences that waited beyond that portal, proved to be expecting her, and whatever mysteries they revealed in the moment of their discovery was nothing compared to the answers they held out to Lanaya should she continue in their service. She swore to protect the mysteries, but more to the point, in service to the Hidden Temple she satisfies her endless craving for understanding. In the eyes of each foe she expunges, a bit more of the mystery is revealed.",
      "tips": "Refraction is highly desirable to level up first, as the increased number of instances is key in playing mind games and the attack damage increase is also significant.<br/><br/>Although leveling Meld will give Lanaya even more damage, it can be difficult to get in attack range to use it effectively without points in Psi Blades. If your team has disables that will give you time to move up into range, or if you can get an early Blink Dagger, Meld is a good choice.<br/><br/>Use Psi Blades as a harass. It has a great spill radius, and not only can it be used to farm more effectively, but also to harass heroes in lane.<br/><br/>Denying with Refraction active will not use up a charge. This means that denies may be used in combination with Psi Blades to get last hits without using all of your Refraction charges.<br/><br/>Alternatives to Blink Dagger include Drum of Endurance and/or Yasha. While the sheer mobility of a Blink is unrivaled, the health, damage, mana, and movement speed of these items may be more reliable.<br/><br/>A similar choice is presented in choosing Phase Boots versus Power Treads.<br/><br/>Beyond their obvious usage, Psionic Traps are also excellent sources of vision.<br/><br/>Though it is usually too late to affect your mid performance, placing traps at the rune spawns will give you excellent rune control throughout the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Psionic Trap is also one of the few ways, and perhaps the most reliable way, to maintain vision of the Roshan pit.<br/><br/>Other good places for traps include jungle paths, secret shop, between enemy towers, and the top of ramps.<br/><br/>When chasing, remember that Psionic Trap gains 5% more slow for every second after placement. Try to place your traps slightly ahead of enemies and let them charge past the base 30%.<br/><br/>Refraction and Meld deal physical damage and can be used to farm siege creeps and ancients. Refraction also works on towers.<br/><br/>Meld can be used to dodge projectiles with its instant fade time. Staying in Meld may be used as an escape but enemies will often use AoE effects to kill you even if they don't have detection.<br/><br/>Refraction effectively has no down time, as its cooldown is the same as its duration. Preemptively casting it before entering a fight may allow you to seamlessly transition from one set of buffs into another."

If you use it on a hero with a powerful auto-attack, such as Ursa, their damage output will be severely reduced. With 100% uptime from level 2 onwards, you can keep one or more enemies' attack damage crippled indefinitely provided you keep using this ability.<br/><br/>Remember that while Ravage travels quickly, it does take a brief time to extend to its maximum range. Very alert opponents might be able to blink away or activate magic immunity before they are stunned, so be sure to blink in closer to those heroes to reduce their window of escape.<br/><br/>Extremely quick fingered opponents may also avoid Ravage by blinking very close to Tidehunter, a small area around Tidehunter exists in which Ravage will not affect very close opponents.<br/><br/>Should the enemy team have a Rubick, it is critically important to cast another one of your spells (generally Anchor Smash) after casting Ravage, as an ability so devastating could easily be the deciding factor in a teamfight should Rubick steal it.<br/><br/>Anchor Smash can be used to clear stacks of Ancient Creeps.

      "bio": "Rizzrack could still hear the screams in his mind. He worked, frantically turning wrenches, twisting screws, building and carving and forging. Sleep eluded him; he only built. Months had passed since he had shut himself in his uncle's workshop, and his deliverance was nearly complete. He rubbed his back as his eyes drifted shut, and saw a blanket of flowers floating on the placid waves of Augury Bay before exploding into a cloud of pollen that silenced lives as it seized the lungs. He woke with a choking start. For hours the rhythmic sound of a whetstone filled the shop as he sharpened a set of massive blades, his mind filled with images of strangling vines garroting neighbors, enwrapping homes. The flooding of Augury Bay had been nothing compared to the violent horrors the waters left to take root beyond the city walls. But the saw-suit would make him strong and safe he thought, allowing himself this sliver of hope before the full might of his fear crashed into his fading mind. Branches and bark and blood. When the city fell, Rizzrack fled trees that walked, and fought, and killed. Trees had shattered the gates and swarmed into the city. Trees had crushed and thrashed and stomped the last that Augury Bay could muster in defense, and stalked the few fleeing refugees. In addled silence Rizzrack unspooled the thick chain from the suit's arm, his hands quaking as he inspected each link and ran a trembling finger along the claw attached at its end. The saw-suit was ready.<br/><br/>With his hand trembling he sparked the bladed machine to life. Terror drove him, terror of what awaited him and of what he would have to face to have any hope of calming his mind. As the saw-suit shuddered to life he knew he must face this fear, and he knew he wouldn't like it one bit.",
      "tips": "Arcane Boots can be disassembled into Boots of Speed and an Energy Booster. This energy booster can then be used to build a Bloodstone.<br/><br/>You may want to build the Boots of Speed into Boots of Travel once you've done this. <br/><br/>It's not always the best idea to disassemble the Arcane Boots. If any of the heroes on your team have mana problems, but have to build other items to be successful, it can sometimes be a good idea to keep the Arcane Boots just to support your allies. <br/><br/>If you are ready to gank in a side lane and are behind trees, use your Chakram to destroy the trees in front of you, then use your Timber Chain on the other side of the lane; after this, a well placed Whirling Death can almost ensure a kill in many situations.<br/><br/>One of Timbersaw's weaknesses is his lack of disrupting spells; he suffers against heroes who excel at channeling spells to harm their opponents. In this case, equip him with an item that has a quick disable, such as Eul's Scepter of Divinity.<br/><br/>When a hero is escaping through only one potential exit, use Chakram to block that path; if successful, the enemy hero will be forced to run through the blade, losing health immensely and slowing down in the process. To further slow the hero down, cast Whirling Death while the hero is in the middle of the Chakram, making sure that you don't widen the enemy hero's escape path.<br/><br/>When deployed, Chakram's movement is somewhat delayed; make sure to predict your target's path and cast it ahead of time.<br/><br/>Chakram synergizes well with multi-target abilities that disable free movement, such as Enigma's Black Hole, Treant Protector's Overgrowth, or even Disruptor's Kinetic Field.<br/><br/>Aside for tanking damage in team fights, Reactive Armor can also be used as a quick health regeneration boost. You can either visit the easy creep camps since they do small damage and come in groups, or tank lane creeps when no enemy hero is present. As long as there are multiple targets attacking you in quick succession, the spell will stack faster, and you will be able to heal faster. Make sure you're receiving damage that is lesser than what you are able to regenerate.<br/><br/>Aside from escape, Timbersaw's skill set also makes for good chasing. Cut down trees that get in your way to widen your path and even prevent juking.<br/><br/>The trees summoned by Nature's Prophet through Sprout are still standard trees to Timbersaw. As an enemy, you can easily cut it down to escape, or free allies who are trapped within it. As an ally, this can be used to your advantage when escaping (as Prophet can summon trees in a convenient location for you to use Timber Chain) or when fighting (Prophet can summon trees closer to you when no other tree is present, so that you can deal pure damage when casting Whirling Death).<br/><br/>Blink Dagger can give Rizzrack incredible engagement ability or even more escape potential. With this setup, he can blink on top of an enemy out of position, use Whirling Death, drop his Chakram, and Timber Chain to safety. This item is only really recommended if your team lacks a better initiator, or you are very far ahead."

   "tinker": {
      "bio": "Boush the Tinker's diminutive race is known for its intelligence, its cunning, and its prickly relationship with magic. As a matter of pride, they survive by their wits, and use only those powers of nature that may be unlocked through rational methodologies. Even this forbearance has led to a great deal of trouble, as Boush can attest. Once a key investigator of natural law, Boush the Tinker led a vast intellectual investigation into the workings of nature, founding a subterranean laboratory in the rumored, mist-wreathed wastes of the Violet Plateau. While scorning mages for the dangers they visit upon the world, Boush and his Tinker associates haughtily wrenched open a portal to some realm beyond comprehension and ushered in some nightmares of their own. A black mist rose from the cavernous interior of the Violet Plateau, shrouding it in permanent darkness from which sounds of horror perpetually emanate. Boush escaped with only his wits and the contraptions he carried, the sole Tinker to survive the Violet Plateau Incident. ",
      "tips": "Laser is an extremely powerful nuke that ignores magic resistance due to being a pure damage spell. Use it as primary source of damage. <br/><br/> Heat-Seeking Missile has an extremely long range. With Rearm, you can continuously spam missiles as to harass enemy heroes and wear them down in preparation of a fight.<br/><br/> March of the Machines is a perfect farming and anti-push tool, as enemies cannot avoid the damage if they wish to attack anything in the affected area. You can overlap several March of the Machines using Rearm to deal massive area of effect damage.<br/><br/> Rearm is Tinker's key ability, since it turns him into a global, powerful pushing and defense machine in conjunction with Boots of Travel.<br/><br/> Boots of Travel is the item which defines Tinker's unique play style due to Rearm refreshing its cooldown, as this enables him to freely teleport to any tower, creep or summoned unit, allowing him to jump into the fray anywhere, and then return to his team's fountain to regenerate.<br/><br/>You should always start with a point in Laser, as the Blind effect (100% miss chance on target) makes it hard for the enemy to last hit creeps. It also provides minor harass and can be used to secure difficult last-hits.<br/><br/>In the early game, saving up the gold for Boots of Travel is your top priority (after an optional Bottle or Soul Ring), since it's the point at which the hero truly \"comes online\". Observe the game and enemy line-up to determine whether you do this by staying in the lane to farm, or ganking to secure kills.<br/><br/> Bottle and Soul Ring are both vital items to prolong the time you spend away from the fountain, and the latter should definitely be picked up before or after Boots of Travel, as the 150 mana boost per Rearm essentially makes up for Rearm's mana cost at level 1.<br/><br/>You can stack commands by holding Shift (also called Shift-queuing) to prevent unintentional Rearm interruptions. Tinker will perform stacked commands right after finishing Rearm.<br/><br/>Pick up a positioning item such as Blink Dagger or Force Staff after Boots of Travel to counter smart opponents predicting your teleports and ambushing you on the lane. Shift-queuing Blink Dagger after teleporting allows you to safely cast March of the Machines from the trees without fear of retaliation, making potential ganks harder.<br/><br/>March of the Machines deals Universal damage, which goes through magic immunity and damages ancients as well as siege creeps.<br/><br/>There are several locations where intelligently-placed March of the Machines can considerably improve your farm.<br/><br/>You may choose to free up the lane to another hero and focus on stacking and farming your faction's ancient camp. This, however, requires strict execution to remain competitive with a mid laner.<br/><br/>A mid-laning Radiant Tinker may stack the easily accessible ancient camp every minute to gain considerable bonus income in the laning phase with a March-focused build.<br/><br/>On Dire, Tinker can aim the ability on the trees to the right side of their ancient camp to defend his off-lane tower and farm the ancients at the same time.<br/><br/>Also on Dire, a well-placed March of the Machines can cover the two eastern-most camps in the jungle. Both camps can be simultaneously stacked by timing this correctly.<br/><br/>Tinker is an extremely mana-hungry hero. Plan your ability and item use to avoid excessive use of Rearm.<br/><br/>Rearm is typically kept at Level 1 until Tinker's mana pool can reliably handle the higher levels' raised mana cost.<br/><br/>Always keep enough mana handy to escape and teleport back to the fountain, as Tinker is a very squishy and vulnerable hero when caught out in the open.<br/><br/>Your global presence allows you to assist in fights when needed. 3 points in Laser and Heat-Seeking Missile are recommended before doing so.<br/><br/>A Scythe of Vyse pick-up allows Tinker to keep a target disabled until his mana runs out. A rotation of Hex - Heat-Seeking Missile - Laser - Rearm - Hex - etc. is a solid option for decimating an enemy target. As always, avoid stacking disables on top of each other.<br/><br/> Ethereal Blade and Dagon result in yet another combo which focuses on stronger burst damage output, with the Ether Blast's 40% magic vulnerability debuff amplifying the impact of Dagon and Tinker's abilities. Few heroes in the game can withstand a rotation of Heat-Seeking Missile - Ethereal Blade - Laser - Dagon - Rearm - Ethereal Blade - etc.<br/><br/> Heaven's Halberd is situational pick-up for teams threatened by robust auto-attackers such as Ursa and Huskar, allowing you to disable their auto-attack for 6-6.5 seconds per Rearm between the Halberd's Disarm and your Laser.<br/><br/>Carefully decide where to push with March of the Machines. Careless pushing will result in your own carries being unable to find farm, while enemies are allowed to farm close to their towers. If pushing out, try to actively siege towers.<br/><br/>If enemy creeps push close to your tower, but the lane is not actively threatened, it's usually a better idea to let your carry farm there before you push the front line back to the enemy."

A splinter broken from a Golem's heel? A shard swept from a gargoyle-sculptor's workshop? A fragment of the Oracular Visage of Garthos? A deep curiosity drives him, and he travels the world tirelessly seeking his origins, his parentage, his people. As he roams, he gathers weight and size; the forces that weather lesser rocks, instead cause Tiny to grow and ever grow.",
      "tips": "Using Avalanche and then tossing an enemy hero into the avalanche allows the avalanche to damage the target twice. This effect also occurs if you reverse the order by using Toss and then Avalanche. However, it is more difficult to time if Toss is used first, as the Avalanche animation may finish before or start after the tossed enemy hits the ground, resulting in less damage being dealt.<br/><br/>Getting your ultimate at level six is highly recommended as the extra move speed and attack damage adds more damage to your combo than points in Avalanche or Toss alone.<br/><br/>While Craggy Exterior does alleviate Tiny's lack of armor, waiting until Avalanche and Toss are maxed to put your first point into it greatly increases Tiny's killing potential and farming potential.<br/><br/>Early game, tossing an allied initiator such as Slardar, Earthshaker or Tidehunter at foes can set their spells up perfectly.<br/><br/>However, tossing team mates can potentially be devastating. When facing enemy heroes such as a Clockwerk with cogs will likely result in serious damage or death to your team mate. As such, a player must use his discretion when utilising Toss<br/><br/>Grow gives Tiny the highest natural attack damage in the game, at the cost of degraded attack speed. If Tiny gets a good standing during the middle phase, Tiny can be equipped with attack speed items to increase its already dangerous power (such as Mask of Madness).<br/><br/>Tiny teams up particularly well with Io, due to Io's attack speed boost and ultimate both being of great use to Tiny.<br/><br/>Toss will throw a unit regardless of it being magic immune or not (excluding Ancient creeps). Sometimes you can use Toss to interrupt channeling spells being performed by magic immune heroes such as Sand King's Epicenter.<br/><br/>An alternative build to the Blink Dagger approach is to rush a Shadow Blade. The Shadow Blade grants attack speed and some Damage. The invisible ability allows him to position more effectively, while the attack speed synergizes with Grow and allows it to be purchased earlier. This often combos into the Aghanim's Scepter pickup.<br/><br/>Although not listed, Manta Style is a great item for Carry Tiny as the illusions can make use of Aghanim's additional range and massive bonus damage from Grow as it is considered as base damage. It also gives +41 attack speed(+26 Agility, +15 raw AS), +10 Strength and +10% movespeed as well. Remember that cleave and 75% bonus damage on buildings from Aghanim's upgrade don't work on illusions."

It is said that the things that grow here, grow strangely. To the forces of nature this is a sacred place, made to stay hidden and unknown. Many are the traps and dangers of this land. There are all-consuming grasses, crossbred fauna and poisonous flowers, but none are so fierce as the mighty Treant Protectors. These ageless, titanic beings, charged with keeping the peace in this dangerous land, ensure that none within encroach without reason, and none without poach their secrets. For time untold they tended to their holy ground, uninterrupted, only dimly aware of the changing world beyond. Yet inevitably the wider world grew aware of this untamed land, and with each passing winter the outsiders grew bolder. Soon they arrived with tools to cut and with flames to burn, and often the Treants would ponder: who are these fragile, industrious creatures? What now had become of the wild, green world? There came and went an age of questions and of doubts, a thousand summers of long traditions set to scrutiny, while more and more the outsiders died and fed their earth. When all that bloomed had finally finished their say, curiosity had overcome caution. It was decided: a lone Protector would be sent into the wider world, and instructed to wander until the glaciers arose once more, to observe the changing land and its creatures, and to discover what unknown dangers could threaten their sacred ground.",
      "tips": "Using Nature's Guise on allies during a gank gives them the element of surprise, and owing to the extremely variable nature of this mechanic the enemy team will struggle to use Sentry Wards to prevent this.<br/><br/>Your autoattack animation and rate are slow, but pack a huge punch. With a little practice, you can put that power to use and greatly assist your lane partner by denying units.<br/><br/>Living Armor can heal buildings. If you have time, and no one else requires it, cast Living Armor on damaged towers. Granted, the ratio of health gained to total health of buildings may be small, but its duration is as long as its cooldown, so you can keep it constantly regenerating health, provided you have enough mana.<br/><br/>Although he is quite tanky, his offensive output is very minimal and once he has initiated with Overgrowth he should conceal himself, firing Leech Seeds from nearby trees (keep in mind at all times that Treant Protector can use abilities without breaking his invisibility).<br/><br/>In a gank, use Nature's Guise to sneak around behind the enemies, as if Leech Seed is used on an enemy running towards you instead of away from you escape will be almost impossible; to say nothing of Overgrowth.<br/><br/>In most circumstances Rooftrellen is most wisely built to maximise his abilities' usage, his lack of mobility and damaging spells mean he is best suited to securing kills for his allies via his slowing and disabling abilities.<br/><br/>A Soul Ring is a good early pick-up for Rooftrellen, as it allows him to spam his Leech Seed as an effective harassment tool while also healing off the damage from the Soul Ring. It also helps solve his mana problems early to mid game.<br/><br/>You can cast spells when you're invisible with Nature's Guise. If you are equipped with items with powerful active abilities, like Necronomicon, Shiva's Guard, and Scythe of Vyse, you can use this to surprise and play tricks on your opponents, as long as you stay near the trees<br/><br/>Your high Strength and attack damage is great. You can purchase attack boosting items like Assault Cuirass, Battle Fury, Armlet of Mordiggian, Satanic, Mjollnir, Abyssal Blade or Mask of Madness to improve your damage output, if your team is deprived of powerful attackers.<br/><br/>Although he's not the best, Treant can be a good jungler because of his high base attack damage and Living Armor damage block, Leech Seed in case of his hp dropping low and Nature's Guise to initiate ganks. It will give the team another solo lane, more gold for him than playing in a dual lane and the ability to keep healing towers with the global living armor when needed while in the jungle."

Males grow to maturity in subterranean chambers beneath their matriarch's domicile, feeding and amusing themselves while contributing nothing.

When young trolls are finally pushed from their sub-chamber, they gather with others of their kind, forming roving gangs of malcontents who complain loudly about all manner of vexation. <br/><br/>As much as trolls love to argue, imagine how rare it is for a troll to be driven from his own kind for being too difficult to get along with.

After one particularly vitriolic outburst in which he claimed the lion's share of loot from their latest raid, his cohorts finally snapped.

As skilled as he was, Ymir had never taken part in a real battle, never tested himself against the indiscriminate death and chaos of war. He proposed a wager to the fighter: seek out the biggest battle he could find, survive, and win it for whichever side he chose. The stakes? The next round of drinks.",
      "tips": "When being pursued by numerous heroes, you can cast Ice Shards toward them to hinder their movement, as the barrier forces them to break up and even come to a slight halt. It is ideal to cast Ice Shards when your pursuers are in a small choke-point, as the barrier will most likely block their way, or at least make it even more difficult for them to move forward.<br/><br/>Ice Shards' missile cast is delayed; keep this in mind when you are targeting distant, fleeing heroes.<br/><br/>When pushing, defending, or farming, Ice Shards is an effective area-of-effect abilities you can use to damage multiple creeps in a straight path; unlike target heroes, Ice Shards doesn't create a barrier when it contacts creeps.<br/><br/>Aid your team's initiator by pairing up with him/her and casting Snowball on the group of enemies; the movement makes both Tusk and his teammate invulnerable, and any target that is hit by it gets stunned for a brief second, giving the initiator some time to act.<br/><br/>Be careful when using Frozen Sigil, as it gives a large bounty when destroyed. Only direct it toward enemy heroes when they are too busy to pay attention to it (i.e. when being pursued by your allies). It has a relatively fast speed and can catch up to most enemies.<br/><br/>Purchase mana boosting items to supplement all of your four active spells, since Tusk is incredibly ability-dependent.<br/><br/>If you managed to get quite some gold from ganks early on, you could consider going for armor-reducing items like Medallion of Courage or Desolator: they give amplified damage for a reasonable price. Just be sure to use your Medallion on the enemy before utilizing your ultimate on him.<br/><br/>If you find yourself without mana too often, you could consider going for Arcane Boots or Intelligence-boosting items like Drum of Endurance or Force Staff, which also come with nice abilities. Alternatively, you could buy items that increase your mana regeneration such as Medallion of Courage and Perseverance (which can also be turned into a Battle Fury, should you get other damage-increasing items before finishing the whole item).<br/><br/>Ice Shards can be used to trap enemy heroes if used as they run close to impassible terrain such as cliffs or the Roshan pit.

Thought left them. Sanity left them. Hunger, however, did not. They turned on each other with split fingernails and shattered teeth. Then it came: distant at first, a fragile note at the edge of perception, joined by another, then another, inescapable and unending. The chorus grew into a living wall of sound pulsing in his mind until no other thought survived. With the Dirge consuming him, he opened his arms to the Dead God and welcomed his obliteration. Yet destruction was not what he'd been chosen for. The Dead God demanded war. In the belly of the great nothing, he was granted a new purpose: to spread the Dirge across the land, to rally the sleepless dead against the living.

      "tips": "One of the best abilities to use early game is Decay: it's quite spammable, and will make ganking easier. You can easily get first blood if you're laning with a good partner.<br/><br/>Decay is very useful even if left at level 1. Max it when team battles begin to start: you can spam it even more and make enemies squishier.<br/><br/>Undying can be played in many ways: if you're going for a more supportive role, use your Tombstone and your Flesh Golem to slow the enemies while spamming Decay, then let your lane partner get the kill. Otherwise, use Soul Rip to finish a Hero while there are many creeps nearby: this way it will deal more damage.<br/><br/>Don't use Soul Rip to harass, but use it to heal a friendly hero or to finish off enemies. This is more effective if there are many units nearby, such as creeps if you're laning, or heroes if you're initiating.<br/><br/>Remember that Soul Rip can be used to heal your tombstone.<br/><br/>While initiating, use Tombstone and Flesh Golem, then Decay/Soul Rip: this way these abilities will deal more damage.<br/><br/>Though his spells are individually quite cheap, you will almost always have mana problems since both Soul Rip and especially Decay are very spammable. Consider getting Arcane Boots during the laning phase, then disassembling it once you have enough to buy the remaining pieces of a Bloodstone. You can then convert your standard boots to Phase Boots allowing you the mobility and chase power to keep Flesh Golem's powerful aura on the right targets during a teamfight.<br/><br/>Another good item for Undying in the early game is Soul Ring. After using Soul Ring, you can cast decay for free. If you hit 2 or more Heros with this spell, you make up for the HP cost for Soul Ring.<br/><br/>If you don't have enough money to buy a Bloodstone in time or you'd prefer cheaper items, try to make yourself as tanky as possible: if you're initiating, enemies will target you first. That's why you need an early Vanguard and/or a Hood of Defiance if the opposing team has a lot of nukers. Other useful items that increase your HP are Rod of Atos, which will probably solve most of your mana problems too, and Heart of Tarrasque.<br/><br/>If a ward spot is nearby at the outset of a fight, remember that you can cast your Tombstone on top of it, making it invisible to enemy heroes (unless they have a ward up there). You can also use the Tombstone as a temporary ward anywhere thanks to it's long duration, but this is not usually advised as it has a lengthy cooldown.<br/><br/>Should the enemy team have an Earthshaker, it is unwise to place a tombstone at the beginning of a teamfight. Each zombie will cause the echo to deal extra damage, likely obliterating your entire team (or at the very least severely injuring them).<br/><br/>Zombies are magic immune, but will take full damage from AoE physical abilities. Be aware of heroes with these abilities that can easily deal with your Tombstone zombies, such as Gyrocopter's flak cannon, Axe's counter helix or Bristleback's quill spray. <br/><br/>If Naga Siren is on your team, be aware that Tombstone will summon zombies even when the enemy targets are sleeping and untargetable. This can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/>In a fight, a Broodmother's Spiderlings can be a valuable weapon. The mass amounts of spiderlings will easily bring your Soul Rip to maximum effect in the late-game, making her a powerful partner to gank with."

It is best used instead to prolong the time enemies are in range.<br/><br/>While used primarily for its slow, Earthshock has an extremely low cooldown and mana cost and, assuming you don't need to save mana for other abilities or items, can be spammed for additional area of effect damage; however, be wary of its long cast animation, as it may allow fleeing enemies to retreat out of melee range.<br/><br/>Given that because of Fury Swipes Ursa Warrior's damage consistently increases, as well as his incredible burst, on equal terms there are no heroes who can actually battle him alone. Consider making attack speed, and durability increasing items as due to his passive and ultimate Ursa does not really need damage items.<br/><br/>With proper management of tangos and salves, Ursa and Wraith King can kill Roshan at level 1. Beware, however that most veteran players are aware of this and it is a risky gamble that, if successful, will give your team a huge early game advantage. This tactic can also be achieved with Ursa and Io, as well as many other heroes such as Anti-Mage, Lich, and Treant Protector.<br/><br/>As Overpower has a 15 seconds duration and only 10 seconds cooldown, it's possible to activate it, wait a few seconds for the skill's cooldown to almost finish resetting, then go in and use up all of it's attacks and then immediately activate it again. This is often known as the Double Overpower and can stack up to 12 stacks of Fury Swipes at max level, effectively giving Ursa 360 bonus damage on the target. This technique is often used to farm Ancients at low levels, quickly kill off a durable enemy Hero, take out Roshan easily or even destroy the enemy fountain due to the fact that Vladimir's Offering and Overpower works on it."

      "bio": "Even the most contented Skywrath is an ill-tempered creature, naturally inclined to seek revenge for the slightest insult. But Vengeful Spirit is the essence of vengeance. Once a proud and savage Skywrath scion, Shendelzare was first in succession for the Ghastly Eyrie until a sister's treachery robbed her of her birthright. Snared in an assassin's net, Shendelzare tore free only at the cost of her wings, limping away in the ultimate humiliation: On foot. With her wings broken, she knew the Skywrath would never accept her as ruler; and in the highest roost of the Eyrie, inaccessible except by winged flight, her sister was untouchable. Unwilling to live as a flightless cripple, and desiring revenge far more than earthly power, the fallen princess drove a bargain with the goddess Scree'auk: She surrendered her broken body for an imperishable form of spirit energy, driven by vengeance, capable of doing great damage in the material plane. She may spend eternity flightless, but she will have her revenge.",
      "tips": "Usually max Magic Missile first, as aside from being a powerful early-game stun it allows allies to land their own, usually-more-difficult spells. Leaving Missile at level 1 in favor of maxing Wave of Terror is a build often seen among professional players however.<br/><br/>Besides being an effective disabler, she is a potent interrupter from Magic Missile and Nether Swap.<br/><br/>Her Vengeance Aura boosts her own damage as well, so do not underestimate her autoattack.<br/><br/>Be aware that Vengeance Aura will push the lane, depriving your lane partner of farm and increasing the risk of a gank.<br/><br/>An amazing item on Vengeful Spirit is Medallion of Courage, it gives her a passive +6 armor which makes her tankier, She gets some good mana regen, and when comboed with her Wave of Terror she can drop a target's armor by -12 making most heroes have negative armor while under attack.<br/><br/>A ganking trick early-game is to Nether Swap an enemy hero into a tower's range, then use Magic Missile to stun them. With the tower's help you should easily kill the hero.<br/><br/>Vengeful Spirit can complement attribute-based carries like Sven, Drow Ranger, and Riki as both her aura and armor reduction enhances their damage. Keep in mind that her aura does not improve bonus damage from items and so is less effective for heroes who rely on such items. She is also effective in helping spells that are hard to land, such as Lina's Light Strike Array. <br/><br/>Wave of Terror is an armour reduction spell with very little mana cost, and should be used in every encounter. It can be used to reveal the fog of war to scout out possible ambushes or to reveal an area for a Nether Swap.<br/><br/>Vengeful Spirit can be an item-independent hero, meaning she can be effective even with minimal items. She should constantly be ganking your opponents keeping enemy carries in check, warding and de-warding maps or assist in pushes. Reserve the farming for your carries, as they require items and levels to be useful.<br/><br/>Nether Swap has multiple uses despite its simple mechanic. It allows Vengeful Spirit to bring an isolated enemy hero into her team, or to exchange her own life for that of a crucial ally. This very often entails suicide, but because of her ability to function with very few items, it is almost always better for Vengeful Spirit to die than for her allies.<br/><br/>With good communication, Nether Swap allows you to escape death by swapping with an ally that has potent escape mechanism such as Queen of Pain's Blink without putting them in much danger. <br/><br/>With Kunkka's X mark the spot on Vengeful Spirit, she can then swap her opponents while being returned back to her exact location afterwards, effectively saving her from imminent death.<br/><br/>Shadow Blade allows Vengeful Spirit to use Nether Swap and then escape from danger, making it a much more useful spell for initiation. Once invisible, She can engage at an appropriate moment in the ensuing team battle, with bonus damage. Ghost Scepter, Ethereal Blade and even Force Staff also have a similar utility with Nether Swap. <br/><br/>If being pursued by multiple heroes, Nether Swap can sometimes be used on the enemy hero furthest from you, resulting in the pursuers to overshoot slightly due to a sudden change in direction, giving you extra time to escape in a different pathway though putting you in the opposite direction from your intended escape route.<br/><br/>Swap goes through magic immunity and interrupts spells, therefore it can be used to stop Magic Immune units from chanelling a spell. This is Vengeful Spirit's main job when there are enemies who use BKB to prevent their spells from being interrupted. For example: If there is an Enigma on the other team, your job as Vengeful Spirit (or indeed as any support) is to stay at back of your team. Should the Enigma use his BKB and then Black Hole, you can swap him out to ruin the initiation.<br/><br/>Vengeful Spirit can be played as an effective carry if needed. She is not the hardest carry in the game, but can prove deadly in this role if played correctly. Items that focus on reducing foes armour, such as Desolator and Assault Cuirass as well as items that boost her primary attribute such as Ethereal Blade and Butterfly synergize with her skill set and maximize her DPS for this role."

   "venomancer": {
      "bio": "In the Acid Jungles of Jidi Isle, poison runs in the veins and bubbles in the guts of every creature that scuttles, climbs or swoops between fluorescent vines dripping with caustic sap. Yet even in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer-but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter-one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons-and new deaths to bring.",
      "tips": "Plague Wards deal weak damage in sparse numbers, but their power becomes significant when massed.<br/><br/>There is a temptation upon being killed to use Poison Nova out of spite. Resist this urge; as it is intended for initiation purposes and its cooldown, unless you have a Scepter at the ability's 3rd level, is not negligible.<br/><br/>Disabling or positioning items like Eul's Scepter of Divinity, Orchid Malevolence, Force Staff, Blink Dagger or Shadow Blade are very wise to build on Venomancer, as his frailty and lack of easily-used escape mechanisms are his Achilles' heel.<br/><br/>Use Plague Wards constantly in order to provide vision of your neighboring area, especially when across the river and inside enemy territory.<br/><br/>Early game, if you use Plague Wards during your laning phase, try to deny them or they will provide a gold bounty for enemy heroes.<br/><br/>Keep Venomous Gale off cooldown during pushes, as its cooldown is quite long and you may need it at any time.<br/><br/>When chasing an enemy, constantly put Plague Wards ahead of them to maintain sight.<br/><br/>Note that the Valve recommended items are not for playing a support style Venomancer. To play support, starting items should include Observer Wards or Courier (or both), early game should be Observer Wards/Sentry Wards and Boots of Speed, and core should be Phase Boots/Power Treads/Arcane Boots, and Mekansm. Everything else listed would be luxury.<br/><br/>Buying an Orb of Venom is a cheap way to increase your slowing potential in the early game, as it stacks with Poison Sting, also applying good DOT for better harassment. This can later be upgraded to the Eye of Skadi, massively increasing the slow and providing additional attributes for Venomancer."

   "viper": {
      "bio": "The malevolent familiar of a sadistic wizard who captured and hoped to tame him, Viper was curiously glad to have been sprung from the sealed and unchanging subterranean Nether Reaches where his race had lived for millions of years, after tectonic slippage had sealed off the Netherdrakes in luminous caverns. Viper spent some time appearing to submit to the wizard's enchainments, hoping to learn what he could of the dark magics the mage practiced. But he soon realized that few spells were as deadly as the toxins that were his birthright. Exuding an acid that swiftly ate away the bars of his cage, the Netherdrake slipped free of his confines, spit poison in the old spellcaster's eyes, and soared out to let the world know that it had a new master.",
      "tips": "Primarily leveling Poison Attack is the best way to slow and damage a target of your choice and doesn't require your opponents to attack you for the ability to be applied. If you're in a lane with supports, this is probably the strongest choice.<br/><br/>Nethertoxin is the generally weakest option to max, but if the rest of your team is capable of getting your opponents to low HP quickly, this will allow you to easily clean up fights. It's a good choice to pick up early if you want to last-hit easier.<br/><br/>Corrosive Skin is the best choice to max first if you'll be in situations where you and your opponent(s) will be trading blows, rather than you just attacking. The damage per level of this ability is roughly the same as Poison Attack, but greatly increases how tanky you are.<br/><br/>Corrosive Skin is especially potent against DoT spells. Between the magic resistance and continuous reapplication of Corrosive Skin to the caster of the DoT, Viper will usually take less damage than Corrosive Skin returns.<br/><br/>As your Poison Attack and Viper Strike slow attack speed as well, apply them to the enemy carry to cripple their damage output.<br/><br/>Late-game, Viper can help push by tanking the enemy creep wave, thanks to the damage return of Corrosive Skin. Of course, the enemy heroes' position should be taken into account.<br/><br/>Viper is great at kiting melee carries with his large variety of slows and with an Aghanim's Scepter."

For an untethered spirit, the decision to journey through the veil of death is irrevocable. When chance comes, and by craft or cunning some restless soul escapes their hells and heavens, it is the dreaded gargoyle Visage, the bound form of the eternal spirit Necro'lic, who is dispatched to reclaim them. Ruthless and efficient, unhindered by the principles of death and fatigue, Visage stalks its prey without mercy or end, willingly destroying all which may give shelter to the fugitive essence. That which flaunts the laws of the afterlife may never rest, for while it is true that the dead may be revived, it is only a matter of time before Visage finds and returns them to their proper place.",
      "tips": "Take Soul Assumption at level 1 if you intend to first blood and have adequate slow/stuns in your lane to make it happen. If not, take Grave Chill instead at the beginning. <br/><br/>A lot of Visage's strength comes from an early level 6 and a strong laning phase.<br/><br/>You should max out Soul Assumption as soon as possible as it is a very potent nuke with very low cooldown allowing you to spam provided you or your allies are taking damage and have sufficient mana. This ability is best utilized during a team fight where a lot of damage is being exchanged between the two teams, make sure to always keep an eye out for the charges of your Soul Assumption and release them as often as possible during a fight as this ability along with your familiars is the main source of your damage output. <br/><br/>Summon Familiars should be taken at level 6, as their damage is of great assistance. <br/><br/>Familiars deal significant damage early game and it can be used to stun opponents or interrupt channeling spells like teleportation. Be warned, the familiars have a very small line of sight but still enough for you to scout ahead or keep track of an enemy that is attempting to juke you. <br/><br/>Familiars damage reduces after each attack and will reach to a pathetic 10 damage after 7 attacks. You should start using them to stun your opponents once they run out of charges. <br/><br/>Fragile support heroes make the best targets for your Familiars as you can cut down their HP very fast and give yourself charges for Soul Assumption for the finishing touch. <br/><br/>Stone form takes 1 second to form, this is quite significant especially when chasing a moving hero. Stone form can also be used to stun your opponents to help you escape sticky situations.<br/><br/>Stone Form can be cast in succession allowing you to 'chain-stun' your opponents. Depending on your skills in micromanagement, you can AoE stun for a lengthy 6 seconds by re-summoning familiars in the middle of the battle. If you have Aghanim's Scepter you can lock down multiple targets for up to 9 seconds with proper micromanagement. <br/><br/>Take great care not to let your familiars be killed, as they grant a 100 reliable gold bounty each.<br/><br/>Familiars in the middle of the stone form animation (before they reach the ground) can still be killed. They will still perform their stun regardless of if they are killed during this animation.<br/><br/>For new players, an easy way to learn Familiar micro is to park your familiars over trees (where they can't be sniped) behind the person you want to kill and fly them out when initiating. You can even practice this to some degree against bots.<br/><br/>Familiars do not expire unless killed or re-summoned.<br/><br/>Do not let the bonuses gained from Gravekeeper's Cloak deceive you into thinking Visage more durable than he actually is. The layers of your cloak burn out very fast if you are being focused or are struck by a Damage Over Time abilities such as Venomancer's Venomous Gale and without the cloak Visage becomes a very fragile target if he does not possess durability enhancing items such as Mekansm or Shiva's Guard considering his miserable agility gain and base armor."

However, so often did his investigations trigger the wrath of protector entities, that he finally found it necessary to master the arts of magic. He bent himself to learning sorcery with the same thorough obsessiveness that marked his quest for incunabula, becoming the most powerful Warlock of the Academy in less time than most practitioners required to complete a course of undergraduate work. Almost as an afterthought, he carved a staff of Dreadwood and summoned into it a captive spirit from the Outer Hells. And anticipating the day when he will have recovered every last lost spellbook, he has commenced writing his own Black Grimoire. It will undoubtedly be instructive.",
      "tips": "Consider going solo lane if your team wants to try an early push strategy. Warlock's attack range, projectile speed, and damage allows him to farm nicely against other solo heroes.<br/><br/>Shadow Word can also be used as a harassing tool. Cast it on your opponent and keep hitting him whenever it's possible. Make sure you don't get hit by creeps too much while doing so.<br/><br/>Fatal Bonds is an immensely useful spell which amplifies your team's damage output. Bond 5 enemies together, and if they are all hit by a single area of effect spell or attack, the total damage will be almost doubled, since everyone of them will suffer 4x20% extra damage echoed from others.<br/><br/>You can use Upheaval to prevent wounded enemies from escaping. This is especially useful if used right after an area-of-effect spell, such as your Chaotic Offering. Let your golem or your teammates finish the job.<br/><br/>During teamfights later in the game channeling Upheaval aids your team more than attacking; after casting Fatal Bonds and Chaotic Offering begin channeling Upheaval immediately to maximize its slowing effect and the amount of damage done by your team and golems.<br/><br/>If an ally is being chased, use your Upheaval to slow his chasers. Since the slow will last for some seconds after you stop channeling, you will also have time to fall back.<br/><br/>Your golem is tanky; when possible, use it to tank creeps or towers, so that you can dispose of them sooner.<br/><br/>You can heal the golem with your Shadow Word to increase its tankiness.<br/><br/>When chasing fleeing heroes with your golem, don't stop to auto-attack them, since it will slow the golem down. Instead, keep it moving with the heroes, so that the Permanent Immolation can do its damage.<br/><br/>Although Refresher Orb or Aghanim's Scepter allow you to summon two golems, Refresher Orb allows you to summon two full strength golems and utilize two seconds of AoE stun, but will cost a lot of mana to pull off, while Aghanim's Scepter is easier and cheaper to build and provides additional attribute bonuses. Having both items will let you summon 4 golems at the same time.<br/><br/>Do not let the golem die needlessly to your enemy heroes, since its gold bounty is quite high. If it's the last remaining unit for your team in a fight, have it flee unless you can ensure a kill. Having it die against creeps or towers is better than allowing an enemy hero to claim the gold bounty of your golem. Having two golems from Aghanim's Scepter will cut the bounty of each golem in half.<br/><br/>Fatal Bonds and Venomancer's Poison Nova make for a deadly combination, as although Poison Nova cannot kill on its own, Fatal Bonds will cause anyone bound and affected by the poison to die from the damage ticking off."

Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keeping one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain-to weave worlds of his own devising. He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew.

Consider using this trick when you got nuked by a strong ultimate (like Lion's - Finger of Death, or Lina's - Laguna Blade).

Now, after many years of training, Windranger fires her arrows true to their targets. She moves with blinding speed, as if hastened by a wind ever at her back. With a flurry of arrows, she slaughters her enemies, having become, nearly, a force of nature herself.",
      "tips": "If you must solo a lane, take Windrun first. This will give you a reliable escape if you are being ganked early.<br/><br/>Power Shot should always be maxed first, as it is a very powerful nuke early. One point in both Shackle Shot and Windrun is usually sufficient. Remember that Power Shot damages invisible heroes, so if you know where they are do not hesitate to use it. Late-game, Power Shot can be used as an exploratory long-range spell.<br/><br/>Power Shot claims to do reduced damage if released early, but releasing it at 80% or more inflicts full damage.<br/><br/>Mekansm is very strong on Windranger. Consider getting it on her after your upgraded boots, provided no one else can get it at a similar time. Remember, Mekansm is better the earlier it's gotten.<br/><br/>Shackle Shot's ministun is extremely useful for interrupting channeled spells, such as Bane's and Pudge's ultimates.<br/><br/>Early-game, unless circumstances are unusual, always save enough mana to Windrun when you are in dangerous territory.<br/><br/>Due to the rework of Focus Fire, it might be useful to level it early, as it is now more useful in teamfights, allowing you to focus down the enemy carry.<br/><br/>Despite being an escape mechanism, Windrun is potentially a very powerful defensive spell, as it allows complete evasion for five seconds at level four giving you a chance to effectly trade hits with an enemy especially by using Focus Fire in conjunction.<br/><br/>Building an Aghanim's Scepter with a powerful attack modifier can shift Windranger's role from supportive chaser/nuker to that of a semi-carry, as it will allow her to scale. However, building a scepter without an attack modifier is not very useful, and Windranger can function very well with attack modifiers even without building a scepter. Build an attack modifier first, then choose whether or not to build scepter."

It is often a good idea to invest a single point into this ability during early laning and then max it later after your other abilities once you have the mana regen to support the higher cost.<br/><br/>Paralyzing Cask is most effective when there are just two enemies close together. Under ideal conditions you can stun two enemies for up to 4 seconds each with this ability.<br/><br/>Paralyzing Cask allows the Witch Doctor to jungle effectively as it stuns neutral monsters for five seconds and deals extra damage.<br/><br/>Casting Maledict on opponents will often immediately force them to retreat for fear of taking crippling damage while under its effects. You can use this to make enemies flee who would otherwise easily kill you or your allies. If they do not flee, then at best they're trading themselves for you.<br/><br/>Maledict is a very weak and expensive spell at level 1, and its damage only starts to kick in once you get it to at least level 2 or 3. In very early game fights, don't worry about landing a level 1 Maledict unless you're sure you can curse multiple enemies or you have enough burst to follow up.<br/><br/>Death Ward is an extremely effective spell against carries that typically rely on Black King Bar to stay relevant in teamfights, such as Luna, Gyrocopter, Lifestealer, Sven, or Dragon Knight.<br/><br/>Although Death Ward is easily interrupted, it is an effective zoning tool in teamfights that will either draw immediate attention from foes with important crowd control spells or force enemies to retreat from the area which the Death Ward resides in.<br/><br/>The Witch Doctor's early game damage and utility from Paralyzing Cask and Maledict are extremely strong in the laning phase. Consider skipping points in Voodoo Restoration until you reach level 10 to maximize lane pressure and damage output. Having Maledict at maximum level as soon as possible allows you to pull off shorter duration Death Wards to secure important kills.<br/><br/>Paralyzing Cask stuns jungle creeps for five seconds, allowing the Witch Doctor to jungle effectively from around level 7 onwards. This is especially useful if you are falling behind or need to speed up a key item such as your Black King Bar or Aghanim's Scepter.<br/><br/>Paralyzing Cask stuns units in fog of war, meaning if you use a high enough level Cask on foes nearby jungle camps, there's a good chance it will bounce back to your enemies.<br/><br/>Consider getting an Orchid Malevolence as it combined with Maledict can bring any damage done to the affected enemy to massive proportions.<br/><br/>If you plan to pick up an early level in Voodoo Restoration, it is often more effective to buy additional Clarity Potions instead of a set of Tangos or a Healing Salve"

Save it for when you really need it.<br/><br/>It's generally best to have Wraithfire Blast maxed first as Ostarion's passives aren't very good in the laning stage.<br/><br/>Learning Vampiric Aura during laning phase will shift the creeps equilibrium and you'll be forced to farm and fight closer to the enemy tower, which will make you more susceptible to enemy ganks in the early game. <br/><br/>Always make sure to save some mana for Reincarnation, since it will not activate if you have less than 140 mana. <br/><br/>One possible solution to this problem is to have a Soul Ring, since it will grant you 150 mana at the cost of 150 HP, this will usually guarantee Reincarnation activating unless the enemies have mana burning capabilities.

If you are the last to die, nobody will be able to help you when you activate Reincarnation!<br/><br/>Refresher Orb is highly situational, as it allows you to potentially Reincarnate twice in a fight allowing you to deal damage for a longer period of time. <br/><br/>Picking up the Aegis after killing Roshan is an excellent idea. It essentially gives you 3 lives, though Reincarnation will activate first as long as you have 140 mana. If you don't have the mana to activate Reincarnation, Aegis will activate first instead. <br/><br/>A Force Staff can help make up for Wraith King's lack of mobility, and it allows him to jump closer to his targets to make up for the short range of Wraithfire Blast."

      "bio": "Lord of Heaven, father of gods, Zeus treats all the Heroes as if they are his rambunctious, rebellious children. After being caught unnumbered times in the midst of trysts with countless mortal women, his divine wife finally gave him an ultimatum: 'If you love mortals so much, go and become one. If you can prove yourself faithful, then return to me as my immortal husband. Otherwise, go and die among your creatures.' Zeus found her logic (and her magic) irrefutable, and agreed to her plan. He has been on his best behavior ever since, being somewhat fonder of immortality than he is of mortals. But to prove himself worthy of his eternal spouse, he must continue to pursue victory on the field of battle.",
